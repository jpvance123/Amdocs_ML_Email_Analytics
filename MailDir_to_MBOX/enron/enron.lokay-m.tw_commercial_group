In an effort to standardize our printer names, on Wednesday, March 21, from 11:30 to 12:30 (during lunch time) we will be renaming a few of Marketing printers.  If you currently print to any of these printers being renamed, you will need to delete the old printer icon and add the new printer icon (after the name has been changed).

Current name / New name
ETSContractsa / ETSMarketingf
ETSContractsb / ETSMarketingg
ETSContractsc / ETSMarketingh
ETSMarketServicesf / ETSMarketingi

To delete the old icon -- select start, settings, printers -- and click on the printer you want to delete -- and hit the delete key on your keyboard.  

To add the new printer -- select start, search, for printers -- and type ETSMarketing -- you will get a list of all of the Houston Marketing printers, to re-add the printer -- just doubleclick on the newly named printer!   This will add the printer back into your "Printers" window.  There should also be a label on the actual printer itself, showing the number. 

Please call me if you have any questions or problems.   I will be at my desk on Wednesday during these changes.   I will also send out an email message when these changes are complete.

Thanks.  Jean 87-7173  /pager  1-877-506-6529

USGT
Sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&E 
Topock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal in 
that the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.  
Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunity 
will likely dry up.  

Enron N.A.
Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation 
in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land near 
Farmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistance 
in moving the project forward.

New Tariff Services
Marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of 
Transwestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plant 
loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services 
provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park 
'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market response 
will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates 
for hourly transportation service.

El Paso 
El Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer to 
Transwestern of a $15 Million lump sum "pre-payment" option of fuel 
monetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to California 
capacity.  El Paso did not take into consideration the different termination 
dates of the two contracts (25,000 MMBtu/d PG&E permanent release contract, 
and 40,000 MMBtu/d Gallup expansion contract) in their analysis.  A revised 
proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.

El Paso Field Services
Met with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near WT-1.  
The I/C would be sized for 40,000 MMBtu/d.  EP proposes to pay for and set 
compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a 
volume commitment of 20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  An added advantage is 
most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area which would 
allow Agave to increase deliveries to TW.

Caithness Corp.
Caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 Mw generation project in 
Northwest Arizona.  The 2-phase project would initially consume 80,000 
MMBtu/d of gas.  The proposed location is 40 miles south of TW's line near 
Wickieup, AZ.  We are meeting with Caithness reps next week.  Projected 
in-service date for the plant is early 2002.

WT-2 Cooler Expansion
Level B cost estimates are being prepared.  Revenue / cost savings 
assumptions predict $500,000 annual revenue to support the expenditure.  Once 
installed, the project would give TW an additional 50,000 MMBtu/d capacity on 
the east end.  Financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is 
received.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has agreed to go forward on a new interconnect 
with TW in Eddy County, NM.  The size of the new interconnect will be 40,000 
MMBtu/d.  EPFS has agreed to pay $165,000 towards the cost estimate of 
$280,000 as well as commit 12,500 MMBtu/d throughput for a period of 2 
years.  Facility Planning is opening a new work order and we have begun 
drafting the Interconnect Agreement and the OBA for the new point.  The point 
should be active in 60 - 90 days.

Arizona Public Service - has still not signed the Transport Request for the 
14,000 MMBtu/d April - October 2001 capacity.  The current spread is $0.375 - 
$0.40.  

Red Cedar - has finally decided on their transport volume under our new 5 
year agreement.  Contract documentation is being prepared.

Sempra - has again exercised their option under their Gallup contract for 
21,500 MMBtu/d Permian to California for 1 year starting 11/1/01. The 
contract rate is $0.30 plus fuel.

Texaco is moving up to 100,000 MMBtu/d from PG&E Topock to Mojave starting 
8/21 through 10/31/00.  TW collected an incremental $.025/MMBtu for this move 
or approximately $160,000.

El Paso Outage-
 Current reports are the Office of Pipeline Safety is demanding El Paso hydro 
test, X-ray and ultrasonic test all 330 miles of pipe that is currently out 
of service due to last weekend's explosion.  It appears the 1 Bcf/d capacity 
to California may be off-line for up to one month.  

Related Developments
  --SoCal released capacity on El Paso for October 2000 to Dynegy at a 
reservation charge of $1.00/MMBtu.
  --Volume on various TW interconnect points has picked up on the east end 
including the new NGPL Winkler point.
  --We are receiving incremental volume from El Paso at Window Rock and 
collecting a portion of the market premium. 

Transport Options - a working group meeting with customers has been scheduled 
for Thursday August 31.  The objective will be to get everyone comfortable 
and build a coalition of support behind our new Options Tariff filing.

Burlington Resources - We held a conference call with John Hinton, Marketing 
Director, regarding the current operation of the Val Verde plant.  Our data 
indicates,with the exception of a few T-5 temperature limit days, TW has been 
able to accept over 98% of the gas nominated by the plant.  In addition, for 
the last 2 years, the plant has been delivering gas with CO2 in excess of our 
specs.  We agreed our latest amendment draft could use some stronger language 
in terms of TW's obligations beyond a "best efforts" basis.   John indicated 
a willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of 
215,000 MMBtu to us for Hub delivery.   We agreed to talk again next week 
once the volume test was complete.

Cal Border backhaul - Operational linepack, slightly reduced demand at the 
Cal border, and California LDC's returning imbalance gas, all combined to 
create an excess gas inventory position at the border for TW.  We then 
received a shipper request to backhaul some volume to SouthWest Gas at Las 
Vegas.  The inventory position necessitated that TW sell some of the gas for 
the backhaul and we negotiated a PG&E based index price.  Economics were as 
follows:

 12/18/00 11,500 MMBtu @ $13.18 =   $151,570
 12/19/00   6,855 MMBtu @ $14.595 = $100,049
 Transport 23,000 @ .15   =  $    3,450
 Park N Ride   4,645 x $.20 x 2   =  $    1,858
 Total          $256,927

PNM Park n Ride - Burlington Resources has had difficulty delivering all 
their gas into San Juan that they nominated this week.  When they could not 
make the delivery rate, we began allocating their volume; this resulted in 
delivery cuts to PNM who then canvassed the market to look for alternate 
supply.  Late Tuesday morning PNM called asking about Park N Ride capability 
on TW.  We negotiated a $.45 rate for 20,000 MMBtu for one day ($9,000).  
Because the rate was above max, we had to file the deal with FERC.  This was 
exacerbated by the fact that because of the customer's request for service, 
we had to ask FERC for a waiver on the "one day prior notice" requirement.

FERC California Pricing - FERC staff members continue to call for help in 
understanding transport and commodity prices for gas at the Cal border.  News 
to us was the fact that FERC has access to EnronOnline but did not understand 
how to use it.  They are also getting a subscription to Gas Daily.

Capacity West - On Thursday 12/21 we did a one day posting for an additional 
10,000 MMBtu/d of LFT capacity for January from San Juan to Cal Border.  The 
current January spread to Needles is $5.40 net of fuel.

SouthWest Gas - We met with SWG management last week to discuss the service 
being provided by TW at their new interconnect.  So far everything is working 
well, however, SWG is attempting to maximize their flexibility under the OBA 
agreement and their ability to take swing gas from TW.  Our response has been 
we will continue to help them when we can within operational limits but we 
cannot jeopardize the rest of the TW west system.  SWG indicated they would 
like more information regarding our mainline expansion project; they recently 
purchased 85,000 MMBtu/d of capacity on the Kern River system.

Pogo Producing - Pogo would like to flow gas to TW's West Texas lateral by 
February 1.  They estimate volume of 20,000 MMBtu/d and have no qualm on the 
approximately $400,000 interconnect cost.  This is a new well near the 
recently connected EOG well.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions
This course builds on the Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Here is a checklist for negotiated rate deals.  It basically just states in writing the procedures we've discussed.  One exception:  Elizabeth, Linda and Michelle, please note that we've decided reference to Sheets Nos. 5B.05, et seq. is sufficient.  If you have questions please let me know.  Thanks!

Hello Michelle,
I received the fax'd/signed copy - thanks so much.  Again, per my v-mail, I
corrected the name of the Assignor company in the first signatory block (the
Assignor is legally Calpine Construction Finance Corp.. - the successor to a
merger with CPN South Point LLC), and I added Jake Rudisill's name and title
in the first signatory block.  So, I'll replace  the first page of the
document you are sending to me with the first page in this updated file,
have signed, and return an executed copy to you/Lorraine.  Thanks again - I
appreciate your assistance!

Michele,
Tony wanted the title changed to "Ratification Agreement and Consent to
Assignment" and the following sentence added:

Effective as of _______, Assignee ratifies the Assigned Agreement, and
assumes the obligations of Assignee thereunder, as if Assignee had been
originally named therein.

Question:  Not being an attorney, shouldn't it read "assumes the
obligations of Assignor"?  The assignor is the original party, right?

 <<New TW Consent.doc>> 
Michelle,
My regrets for the delay in getting this to you - however, prompted by
the
comments supplied by your legal counsel, we've discovered, and are
verifying, that the first Consent to Assignment Agreement that we
forwarded
to Lorraine referenced the WRONG Agreement - a possible mistake on our
part,
and if it turns out to be so, something we regret happened.  Again, I
will
confirm once my legal team confirms.

Instead, it has become (painfully) obvious that the Agreement that
should
have been referenced in the Consent to Assignment document is the
Measurement and Control Facilities Operating Agreement dated February
12,
2001 between Transwestern and CPN South Point LLC ( now, Calpine
Construction Finance Company, LP as successor by merger to CPN South
Point
LLC).  The New Consent provided above has been modified and we suspect
that
no edits will be necessary: To confirm, South Point Energy Center, LLC
will
be funded with assets transferred from Calpine Construction Finance
Company,
LP at the closing scheduled for Oct. 18, 2001.  

Your facilitation of the Consent to Assignment is appreciated - pls.
contact
me with any questions.

We need your help!

On Tues 4/17 at 2:30 pm in room 49c2, the TW Market Team will meet with the software business development team to review criteria to be included in the new ETS Invoicing System.

We will review the structure of current negotiated rate transactions (and their manual rate calculations) plus try and define additional pricing flexibility we would like to see incorporated into a new system.

What you need to bring:

	1) Ideas for various market-based rate calculations
	2) Brief pricing description of current deals we manually calc rates for on a monthly basis
	3) Other parameters you feel the system should include

If you have a conflict with the above date, please see me.  Meeting should last no more than one hour.

thanks
Kevin

Earl,
Do you know where we stand on getting this equipment installed?  Besides the GC, Del Mar, Water Monitor, there is still no power at the location.  We also have no positive shut-in or overpressure protection.  According to Bennie, EOG plans to tie in another well.  We're already flowing 30mmcfd.  I appreciate anything you can do to speed this up.
Thanks,  Arnie

Arnie:  As per our conservation 03-08-01 reguarding the status of the EOG Pronghorn station, they are now in the process of putting a second well into that line, the volume is not known at this time, but we still have not heard anything about a time line for getting the GC, Del Mar, dewpoint instrument or building.  We talked to Rich last month and he in return talked to Earl, and it is my understanding that it is in motion,  I  just want everone to know any changes out here , like the addition of a new well.

I've a couple of suggestions here.  First, given the excruciating experience 
we had last time with one-tenth increments, should we consider two-tenths 
(I'd like to use 1/4 cent increments but we're limited to 3 decimal places)?  
Secondly, I've tried to respond with a language fix for paragraph 5 
consistent with your concern of how to handle alternate rights.  Finally, 
I've done a little tinkering with the terms sheet.  Ya'll are free to do with 
these what you will.

Subject: Re: TW IOS Posting PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL  

Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last 
posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but 
omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).

My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand 
how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As 
currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on 
use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our 
granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do 
intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted 
rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  

If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much 
of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.

Any questions -- give me a call.

S.

Subject: Revised Transportation Proposal

Hi Ed - Here is a revised comprehensive summary of the firm transportation 
proposal between Red Cedar and Transwestern:

Term:  5 years, January 1, 2001through December 31, 2005

Year	Volume	Rate(+option fee)
1	125,000 MMBtu/d*	$0.02/MMbtu/d
2	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.025/MMBtu/d
3	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.03/MMBtu/d
4	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.035/MMBtu/d
5	150,000 MMBtu/d	$0.04/MMBtu/d
		

Option:  Red Cedar shall have a one-time option to reduce its contract MDQ 
for contract years 4 - 5 to a volume between 100,000 MMBtu/d - 150,000 
MMBtu/d.  Red Cedar may trigger this option anytime before November 30, 
2003.  Option fee is an incremental one-tenth of one cent/MMBtu (additive to 
the above quoted rates) over the five year term.

Facility Modifications:  The current cost estimate to increase the meter 
capacity (from 200,000 MMBtu/d to 300,000 MMBtu/d) at the Arkansas Loop Plant 
into Transwestern is $378,000.  * Year 1 capacity of 125,000 MMBtu is 
dependent upon the completion of these facility modifications.  Red Cedar 
will fund these facility modifications (by a one-time payment of $378,000 
payable prior to Transwestern ordering material for the modifications).  In 
order to avoid the tax gross-up of approximately $130,000, the $378,000 will 
be amortized over the term of the contract and booked as "pre-paid" 
transportation fees.  (The net effect of this will be zero because the slight 
increase/MMBtu which will show up on the monthly transportation invoice will 
be negated by the corresponding credit for the pre-paid transportation.)

Please call me to discuss.  Thanks.

Lorraine

This Friday report has traditionally gone to Steve & Kevin.  The entire 
commercial group will receive it going forward.

For the week August 14-18th:

Transwestern's weekly average deliveries to California were 1,001 MMcf/d 
while east end deliveries averaged 406 MMcf/d.  San Juan lateral throughput 
averaged 850 MMcf/d while receipts from Rio Puerco were at the maximum 75 
MMc/f level for the entire week.  Transwestern had consistent deliveries even 
to Mojave/Topock this week of 52 Mmcf/d - a record for that delivery point.

El Paso deliveries to California averaged an 82% throughput level of 2,425 
Mmcf/d for the week:

 PG&ETop (capacity 1,140 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 706 MMcf/d
 SoCalEhr (capacity 1,247 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 1,191 MMcf/d

Regarding the subject proposed interconnect, where EOG desires to receive 2 
MMcfd from TW's 16" Crawford lateral, the available connection available is a 
4" side valve (formerly used for Highland - Pecos Irrigation,  POI # 500269; 
Sect. 10, T23S-R28E, Eddy Co., New Mexico Higland-Pecos Irrigation).  The 
former measuring facilities, the lateral, and the 8" Crawford lateral were 
all sold to Duke.  TW measurement facilities do not exist at the interconnect 
that can be re-activated for EOG gas lift measurement/regulation.  Should EOG 
desire to receive lift gas from TW, then new measuring and regulating 
facilities will be required.  See Figure 1 below for connection details.

However, expected operating pressures available on the 16" Crawford lateral 
is common to suction pressures observed at the suction of WT-1 Compressor 
Station that varies between 580 - 630 psig (see Figure 2, daily average 
pressure graph for May-Oct 2000).  As you indicated that EOG's line pressure 
would be near 650 psig, it will not be possible for TW to deliver into EOG 
unless they can lower their line pressure to about 550 psig or add 
compression.  

If feasibility exists for EOG to add compression and you would like for me to 
proceed with providing a Level "A" cost estimate for measuring/regulating 
facilities, please reply or give me a call.  Eric - 713/853-3395

Michelle, I thought I would pass this along to make you aware that now EOG 
isn't going to supply the EFM at their new location.  Given that they have 
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts, I don't think we 
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the 
$10,000.  Maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the 
estimate back to the $30,000 we originally requested.

Thanks, Bob

On the EFM / SCADA, I talked to Dirk Ellison with EOG. He contacted Jerry 
Ball and their reply was for us to go ahead and get our own equipment. 
Laura's work order doesn't have anything about EFM, only the costs to inspect 
the construction and their connection to our tap valve. Laura will check on 
the responsibility of the EFM equipment tomorrow.

Thanks

For your convenience and/or use by your customers, I've revised the proposed 
term sheet to include the two (2) altenative sharing mechanisms that your 
customers should base their bids upon.  This term sheet also includes a 
second example of how the sharing mechanism works.

Subject: Additional bid criteria

We've been asked to go back to the shippers and secure two (2) bids on the 
capacity.   Ask your shippers to look at the term sheet and give us a bid on 
(1) the [original] 30% sharing mechanism on alternate west flows, and (2) a 
50% sharing mechanism on alternate west flows.  Let them know we realize that 
the 50% sharing mechanism will likely result in a reduced reservation rate, 
however, we'd like to see both "looks" at the deal.  Also, whether we choose 
the structure with a 30% sharing, or the 50% sharing, let them know that 
we'll make our decision on best bid [on Friday] based on the highest NPV of 
reservation bid.

It still looks like Saturday for unit #3. They are working to get the 
compressor back on the skid, and then they will start it up 
and do web deflections on the unit. Hopefully all will go well.

To follow up on our phone conversation this morning...you had found an additional 4,514 MMbtu/day of West Texas receipts available during the months of 11/02, 12/02, 01/03, and 02/03.  Let's allocate this to the remaining 2 shippers still looking for West Texas supply.  Please allocate on the administrative contract as follows:  2,000 will go to PP&L (they will now have everything they need from West Texas) and 2,514 allocated to Calpine (they will also now have everything they need).  Paperwork is forthcoming.  I believe these will be the last amendments prior to flow.  Thanks.

OK, I believe we have a consensus.
If I understand correctly our posting period for this capacity expires on Monday at 5 p.m.
You should accumulate service requests for the capacity until that time.  Tie bids will be decided by a lottery.
If shippers ask you can explain to them that since this is newly posted capacity, we're posting it until 5 p.m. Monday and will not award capacity until that time, and if requests for service exceed available capacity we'll award it based on the procedures in Section 13 of the FTS-1 Rate Schedule.

Per our previous decisions, we have utilized the provisions of section 13 for purposes of allocating capacity.  Therefore I agree with Maria, that we would need to conduct a lottery if there are tie bids. I also agree that the reference to fCFS in Section 1 is meaningless and should be eliminated.  I would guess that that was there from inception, and has just been a non event.   Mary, put on clean up log.   MK

It does say first come first served, but then in the ROFR section says we won't maintain a queue.
Maybe we should delete "first come, first served" next time we do a tariff cleanup filing?

Subject:	RE: TW posting question -- URGENT

I'm assuming that we did not post any parameters or allocation methodology on March 19.   Without any parameters, we're better off sticking as close to the tariff allocation mechanism as possible.  The reason we post for 5 days is to have a pseudo-open season, giving everyone a shot at this capacity and treating all shippers during the open season similarly no matter when they came in.  Allocating the capacity on a FCFS basis is contrary to the open season concept.   I think we would be better off to treat both shippers similarly by allocating their equal bids pursuant to the lottery mechanism which is set forth in our tariff.  That's my vote.   thanks, maria

Subject:	TW posting question -- URGENT
Importance:	High

Conoco did not exercise its right of first refusal on 20,000 of capacity on TW so it has gone back out on our EBB yesterday.
Mindful of our posting guidelines for newly available capacity (i.e. 5 days before we sell for a year or more, 3 days before we sell it for a term of 5 months - 1year, 1 day if we are going to sell it for 5 months or less), assume the following scenario:

March 19:  capacity is posted
March 21:  Shipper A calls one of our marketers and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
March 22:  Shipper B calls and offers max rate for the capacity for 2 years
March 23:  posting period ends (assuming of course that the capacity got posted at 9 a.m. on March 19)

Questions:  Who gets the capacity?  What do we tell Shippers A and B?

We could say "first come first served," but our tariff specifically states that we will not maintain a queue.
Is the better answer that we accumulate service requests until the close of the posting period, then have a lottery?

Please let me know your comments.  We need a consensus ASAP -- before we get that first offer.  Thanks.

This is pretty useful reference material and info site...
     
 NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : November 30, 2000

EIA Rolls Out Long List of New Gas-Fired Power 
Between 2000 and 2004, a total of 145,417 MW of nonutility generation is 
expected to be added to the U.S. power grid and 83% of that total will be 
gas-fired power generation, according to a new survey by the Energy 
Information Administration. 

The EIA's Inventory of Nonutility Electric Power Plants in the United States 
find that a total of 799 new gas-fired units, totaling 120,645 MW in 
nameplate capacity, are scheduled to be added by the end of 2004.  The 
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council is expected to receive the largest 
portion of new nonutility generation with an additional 252 units totaling 
36,636 MW.  SERC is followed by ERCOT with 109 new units totaling 21,775 MW, 
ECAR with an expected 181 additional units totaling 17,733 MW and MAIN with 
140 new units totaling 17,139 MW. 

The largest amount of new nonutility capacity, or about 61,823 MW, is 
expected to be added in 2002.  About 46,551 MW of new capacity is scheduled 
to be in service next year. 

Electric restructuring has led to a boom in nonutility power generation.  The 
EIA report found that total nonutility generation in 1999 reached 167,357 MW, 
which was a 71% increase from the previous year.  However, only 21% of the 
total represented new plants.  In 1999, about 50,000 MW of electric utility 
generation assets were purchased by nonutility generation companies.  At the 
end of 1999, nonutility generation accounted for 19.8% of total electric 
generation in the country.  The totals reported by EIA include all operable 
units, even those that did not run at all in 1999 but are expected to return 
to service. 

Gas-fired power accounted for the largest share of nonutility generation last 
year, and the Pacific Census Division accounted for 31.4% of that gas-fired 
capacity. The Pacific Census Division also accounted for the greatest number 
(1,167) of total nonutility generation and the most nonutility capacity 
(33,254 MW). California was the dominant state in the division with 30,189 
MW. 

Gas-fired (only) generation represented 29.4% (49,353 MW) of total nonutility 
capacity in 1999, and petroleum/natural gas (fuel switchable/combined) 
generation accounted for 24.2% (40,508 MW) of the total. Coal represented 
28.9% (48,501 MW).  Hydroelectric power accounted for 3.6%. Petroleum (only) 
totaled 2.2% and all other sources amounted to 11.5% of total nonutility 
generation. 

The top five states based on existing nameplate capacity are California 
(30,189 MW), Illinois (24,013 MW), New York (17,256 MW), Pennsylvania (12,483 
MW) and Texas (12,376 MW).

Senators Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith
Announce Partnership in Response to the Western Energy Crisis
March 15, 2001
Washington, DC - Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) today announced an agreement to introduce bipartisan legislation to restore stability and reliability to the Western energy market by directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to impose a temporary "just and reasonable" wholesale rate cap or cost-of-service based rates.
The legislation will also require the states involved in this effort to pass on the cost of the electricity to retail customers. However, the states would be able to determine how and when this would be done. In other words, California could choose to use tiered-pricing, real-time pricing or set a baseline rate above which prices would be passed through.
"We now have a piece of legislation that can fix the broken electricity market and provide a period of reliability and stability in wholesale energy costs," Senator Feinstein said.
"FERC has found the wholesale prices being charged in California to be unjust and unreasonable. This legislation essentially will mandate that once FERC makes such a finding, the agency will carry out its regulatory role. This is a $175 million a year agency. It is there to regulate the energy marketplace, and it should. What the Federal government can do is to provide a period of reliability and stability at a time of crisis. Unfortunately FERC has refused to do so."
"California's broken electricity market is a result of a flawed 1996 California law that deregulated wholesale costs, but left in place caps on retail prices. This was coupled with a requirement that the utilities divest themselves of their generating capacity and buy most of their electricity on the spot market, where prices have escalated dramatically. In hindsight all of this came together in a catastrophic scenario, so that today, California buys electricity at astronomical prices. We believe that FERC needs to act to help restore reasonable costs and stability to this marketplace."

Subject: POGO Checklist- Revised

Delete prior Check-list,  The location was ERRONEOUS.

Perry - Attached is the checklist and project summary for a potential POGO 
well connect to Transwestern in Lea County.  POGO has already spudded the 
well and expects a 45 day drill and completion time.  Early estimates for 
well completion is set for early/ mid February 2001.  TW field personnel have 
already met with POGO field personnel to determine the tie-in location for 
this well.  Even though there is an existing flange at the EOG/Pronghorn 
location, which is in close proximity to the POGO well location, another 
location was selected which also does appear to have an existing flange.  
Initial production of this well may be similar to the 30+ MMBtu/day initial 
production of the EOG well.

Please let me know when we can discuss this project, or if I need to provide 
you any additional information at this time.  Christine.

Fuel Hedging - We hedged another 5,000 MMBtu/d of fuel for 2001 at $3.63.  
This brings our fuel hedge thus far to 15,000 MMBtu/d at an average price of 
$3.53 (basis adjusted).  We are evaluating doing another 5000/d and/or 
selling out-of the-money calls and collecting the premiums.

Interactive Open Season - TW has posted an announcement for an Interactive 
Open Season to be held August 10, 2000 for 14,000 MMBtu/d of East of Thoreau 
to PG&E/Topock capacity for the term of April 1, 2001 - October 31, 2001.  
With Topock values currently depressed relative to Needles, we'll attempt to 
add some value to the IOS by giving shippers alternative delivery capability 
at Needles and the new power plant at Citizens/Griffith.

Southwest Gas - has finally begun construction on the new interconnect 
between SWG and TW!!!  Per our Interconnect & Operating Agreement we must pay 
the remaining half of the CIAC, which is estimated to be $442,500, "...no 
later than 10 days following the date on which SWG notifies TW that the new 
interconnect will be in-service within 3 months."  SWG has not met this 
criteria yet.

Burlington - Burlington has requested TW respond to an apparent discrepancy 
in the physical volumes we can (or cannot) take from them at the Val Verde 
Plant versus the currently effective operating agreement.  The problem is 
current high temperatures in the San Juan region have limited our take-away 
capabilities and the summer / winter seasonality was not taken into account 
when we drafted the last amendment in January of this year.  We will meet 
with Legal, Facility Planning and Gas Control to craft a response for Richard 
Riehm.

Amoco - We have scheduled a conference call with Legal and Commercial Reps 
from Amoco for next Tuesday afternoon to discuss the Transport Options 
Program.

Red Cedar - Negotiations continue on the FT deal.  Red Cedar has requested an 
option to call on 35,000 MMBtu of capacity in year 2 of the 5 year 
agreement.   Working with Enron Risk Management, we determined the value of 
this option to be approximately $200,000 which may be rolled into the 
contract.

El Paso Field Services - In our efforts to move ahead on the new 
interconnect, we have responded to EPFS that TW would commit $100,000 towards 
the new interconnect as well as require a volume commitment from EPFS of 
20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  EPFS is taking TW's offer to management 
for review.

El Paso Natural Gas - The letter to EP for Stan Horton's signature relative 
to our Blanco measurement dispute is going through its final iterations and 
should be ready to send by Friday 8/4.

Thanks for the time yesterday, to sync the West Texas group unsubscribed volumes.  I reviewed your spreadsheets and had 2 changes,  they are in red text with a green shade.  I have made the corresponding revisions to the CAS groups # 13 & 17, as a group adjustment.  The EBB will reflect these changes at or around the 2:30 pm Friday 11/09/01 update to the EBB.  I have attached the rev. spreadsheet for your reference.  The Red Rock Adm. Contracted volumes are right for the time period on your xls.

 
Thanks PT  3-0667

Michelle sent me the attached (different version) this morning for approval where she changed the first paragraph.  I've reviewed the original version Susan Scott just sent as well.  It appears that most of the changes were just spelling out "Transwestern."  I am ok with both versions as long as we have the July, 2000 date correct.  Please send me the final version that goes out for my records.

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail, the other lawyers wanted a few changes.  My sincerest apologies for the confusion.  Apparently you and I were actually working off an old version of FGT's letter, not the one they ultimately approved and used.  Since you are out of the office, I've taken the liberty of forwarding it to Carl without you reviewing it first, since I know we want to mail this out soon.  

Carl, Michelle advised me that EOL's lawyer had approved the previous version so I assume they will want to review this one as well.  Let me know if there are any concerns.

Thanks!

Audrey, pls. forward this memo to the TW commercial team.  Thanks, Maria


I recently discussed above-maximum rate deals with Northern's commercial team and wanted to forward what I shared with them to you.  Pls. call me if you have any questions about this memo.  Thanks, Maria

Subject:	Negotiated Rates



Pursuant to our conversation yesterday, here are some guidelines for the Northern marketers to follow when doing above-maximum rate negotiated rate transactions.  

The Commission permits a pipeline to charge above-maximum rates under negotiated rate authority provided that the capacity also remains available at the maximum recourse rate.   In other words, we cannot unilaterally require a customer to purchase capacity at a rate above the max rate; however, customers may willingly choose to pay a negotiated rate (above max rates or below minimum rates).

Below are some FAQs and the appropriate response when negotiating rates with customers in an above-maximum rate environment.

1.	Is it better to use a fixed rate or an index/formula based rate?  It is better to use an index or formula based negotiated rate as opposed to a fixed rate, as the index or formula-based rates provide a reasonable basis as to why a customer would enter into a negotiated rate transaction exceeding max rates, e.g. to accommodate the customer's risk profile.  

2.	Who should propose the rate?  It is better for the customer to propose the rate.  You may ask questions like:   Have you seen the spread?   What do you think?  What can you give me for the subject capacity?  Will you split the upside?  If so, what is a fair split?  The goal here is to have the customer come up with the rate.  If the customer won't go there, it is never appropriate to bully, cajole, or use undue pressure to get an above-maximum rate deal.  Moreover, we can never imply or otherwise indicate that the capacity is unavailable if the customer does not pay a negotiated rate or above-maximum rate.    

3.	Do I have to offer the maximum rate or say this capacity is also available at the maximum rate?   Our capacity is always offered at the maximum tariff rate because that is the rate on file which the shipper sees when he/she looks at our tariff.    We don't have to expressly state the capacity is available at our maximum recourse rate, but if the customer requests to pay the maximum rate, no further conversations about paying a negotiated rate should take place.  In other words, we have to sell available capacity at the maximum rate once a shipper asks for that rate unless we are negotiating a longer term maximum rate deal for such capacity at the same time.    In such circumstances, please confer with regulatory and legal so that we can determine what action is appropriate to take given the specific facts.  

4. 	Can a shipper get a higher priority by paying more than the maximum rate?  No.  Shippers willing to pay more than the maximum recourse rate are considered to have paid the maximum recourse rate for capacity allocation and priority purposes.  A shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  Where there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate on the allocation basis required by the tariff.


Given that customers have recorded phone lines, be careful what you say.  We cannot deny the availability of capacity at the recourse rate, nor can we mislead customers into believing that the maximum rate is unavailable for certain capacity for any reason.

Kern River's throughput to CA was only 59%?  Did they have an outage?  Is the 
remaining gas dropping-off before CA?  We usually assume in our gas flows 
analysis that Kern is 100% full.  This seems unusual.

Citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today.  TW will be taking over the operations
and monitoring the Griffith plant on Citizens behalf.  We will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have
a call out sheet for Citizens personnel.  We also will be responsible for the operations at the plant.  Currently
in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW.  Please get familiar with the points
and how set points will need to be sent.  To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1.  TW will be at 2.
When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control.  Set points less than
140,000 will stay on flow control.  We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and 
El Paso.  Currently we have orders just off of TW.

1.  Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000.
     this is on flow control.  
2.  When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure.   We
     will just have to experiment with the best operation. 
3.  Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C.  We are working with Citizens 
     to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.) 

I put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review.  
If you have questions we can get with Craig Lipke with Citizens and ask for their help.  Last conversation with him
was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation.  In other words they really don't
know which is the best way to operate.

Thanks DS

Attached are the daily Mojave Topock scheduled volumes for September 2000.

Please let me know what other months that you need.

Once we determined which day(s) are different, I can work with El Paso to determine which shipper contracts caused the difference.

Hi Beth,
	According to the engineers, minimum pipeline delivery pressure would likely be 750 psi at the Panda interconnect.  Let me know if you have questions.  

talk with you soon.

Sorry I didn't get to talk to you earlier...we have been in one meeting after another!

What's going on?  The receipt points are in the Blanco area at the Bloomfield Compressor, so that would include the Transcolorado point.  The NWPL interconnect is further north, where we are currently fully subscribed.

FYI, one of the meetings I was in, was a strategy session on what to do what all our remaining capacity (of which part of that is what you are now interested in).  Transwestern is thinking of posting an open season utilization this space with California capacity.  

It sounds like you guys are definitely interested and because I am out of the office next Monday, please call me on my cell phone 713-907-3198.

Michelle:  I did talk to Rick Maceyka (my boss) regarding our conversation about the lateral space on TW.  We are definitely interested.

Is the receipt point in SJ pool good from either NWPL or Transcolorado? 

Thanks, Terri

FYI--Below is the Gas Daily article about the ACC comments filed at FERC in the CA. Infrastructure proceeding.    gh

Arizona warns of Southwest capacity shortfall
California is not the only state worried about the adequacy of its gas pipeline infrastructure.
In recent correspondence with FERC, the Arizona Corporation Commission urged federal
regulators to put California's capacity shortage in a broader regional context; failure to do
so, the ACC warned, might cause California's gas supply problems to spread to other states.
"Given the regional, multi-state nature of the interstate pipelines in the Southwest, any
actions taken by the FERC to address California's interstate pipeline system will have wide-spread
ramifications for Arizona and a number of other states," said the ACC.
As part of its effort to tackle California's energy woes, FERC staff has been studying the
state's pipeline infrastructure to see if there are ways to improve the delivery of gas. In May,
the commission hosted a conference devoted entirely to gas transportation issues in California
(GD 5/25); representatives from neighboring states also got involved.
In comments sent to FERC on June 22, the ACC expressed concern that measures to
remedy California's gas shortage might shift much-needed capacity away from its state. If
federal regulators do not press for the improvement of pipeline services throughout the South-west,
it might "lead to a worsening of regional problems and/or a shifting or spreading of
problems from California to Arizona and other states," the ACC argued.
In particular, the ACC said that it was alarmed about the continued reliance of Arizona shippers
on the El Paso Natural Gas system. At present, two interstate pipelines - El Paso and Transwestern
Pipeline - serve the state, but the bulk of Arizona shippers only have access to the El Paso system.
"The ACC is becoming increasingly concerned with the pipeline capacity situation in
Arizona and whether current natural gas shippers in Arizona, with existing contract rights on
the El Paso system, will receive reliable pipeline service in the future," wrote the commission.
"It is widely recognized that the El Paso system running through Arizona to California has
been operating at very high utilization rates recently. Additionally, it appears that little or no
additional pipeline capacity will be added by El Paso in the near future to serve existing cus-tomers
and their existing contract rights, beyond the Line 2000 expansion which will largely
replace capacity that has been lost for other reasons."
El Paso recently won approval for Line 2000, which will boost deliverability into Califor-nia
by as much as 230 million cfd. But despite efforts to add capacity, the pipeline has been
dogged by complaints about access to its system.
According to shippers in Texas, Arizona and New Mexico, El Paso has proposed a new
allocation scheme that would force captive shippers to pay more for access to its system. Echoing
the comments of the ACC, the shippers said they faced degradation of firm service rights because
of El Paso's diminished ability to deliver gas consistent with contractual obligations (GD 5/30).
FERC, in fact, is planning a technical conference next month to discuss the issues raised
by El Paso's latest allocation plan. The meeting is scheduled for July 18, but FERC allowed
that the meeting may continue through July 19.
The concerns of the ACC may help shore up the assertions of east-of-California shippers.
Contrasting the access that California shippers have to pipelines and storage facilities, the ACC said,
"FERC should ensure that captive shippers are not disadvantaged due to their lack of options."
Most importantly, said the ACC, FERC should encourage capacity additions that serve the
needs of both existing shippers and expansion shippers. "The complexity of the issues and the
potential for inadvertently exacerbating the region's pipeline capacity problems argues for a
careful and thorough approach to the issues, ensuring that customers in Arizona, California and
elsewhere in the region are well served by any change in the treatment of pipeline capacity in
the Southwest," the ACC concluded. (PL01-4, RP00-336) NH

The Draft Proposed Decision for the Comprehensive Settlement doesn't specifically address this 50MM/d.  My recollection is that this new capacity was discussed in the SoCal System Adequacy proceeding last summer however the new open access procedures should allow for designating this receipt point capacity from Transwestern.  I'll verify this as soon as they issue the final decision which may be this afternoon.  gh

Subject:	RE: SoCal Unbundling

What about the access to the 50,000/d of new capacity at Needles that was being constructed? Wasn't that part of this proceeding? SoCal had argued that it would go to TW (we needed it for Red Rock).

At yesterdays CPUC meeting the Commission approved on a 3-2 vote the Comprehensive Settlement we supported to unbundle the SoCal system.  This includes open access to their backbone system and receipt point procedures we supported.  I'll distribute the final order as soon as its available with the effective dates and details.  gh

Settlement discussions have hit the wall.  Conoco, the third of the Indicated Shippers the commercial group was going to talk to, cancelled their Friday meeting stating that their regulatory folks told them they shouldn't meet with Transwestern (Re: Negotiated Rate Proceeding) unless all of the indicated shippers were present... never mind the fact that TW had already met individually with BP/Amoco and Burlington.

Exceptions to the October 24, 2001 Initial Decision are due by Thursday, November 8, 2001.  TW will need to response with in seven days.  I have asked Steve Stojic, with the assistance of Maria, to circulate the first draft.  

Any questions, please let me know.  Greg

We need your assistance!!!

You, on a weekly basis, submit bullet items to Steve for posting on ETS' Intranet Update page.  Steve edits and reviews the bullets   prior to publication.  

We would like for you to take time each week to review the final version of the week's bullets.  Compare and take note of the changes Steve incorporates, i.e., adding phrases such as - MMBtu, operational fuel, etc.   Steve should spend less time editing and more time reviewing your accomplishments, don't you agree?

Please call if you have questions and thanks in advance for your cooperation,

Subject: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker - CERA Alert




**********************************************************************
CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 15, 2000
**********************************************************************

Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker
Author: N. American Natural Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1230 ,

Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market, as three 
factors-increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US 
wellhead supply still struggling to rebound-call into question the ability to 
build storage to a level adequate for next winter. As strong as gas market 
fundamentals are, gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength 
in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more 
expensive than in recent years.  In this environment intense competition 
between power generation demand and storage injections will continue 
throughout the summer-with pressure increasing into July as temperatures 
rise-and gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to 
discourage end-use demand.

The $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) increase in gas prices 
since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users. 
First, gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the 
East Coast, and gas will likely lose approximately 600 million cubic feet 
(MMcf) per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last 
summer. Second, several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut 
down. Equally telling, however, is that heat in any one region of the 
country-most recently the West-is all that is required to sustain gas prices 
above $4.00 at the Henry Hub, despite relatively moderate temperatures 
elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets. 
Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from 
current levels as higher temperatures arrive. For these reasons CERA expects 
prices to average $4.45 at the Henry Hub during July (see Table 1), and even 
greater volatility is !
possible. The intense competition and need to price out end-use demand mean 
that the market is vulnerable to spikes above $5.00 per MMBtu amid heat waves 
this summer.

Gas Storage-Injections Increase, but Little Relief Yet

The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage 
injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages, with the 
American Gas Association (AGA) reporting 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of 
injections during each of the weeks ending June 2 and 9. However, these 
injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to 400 Bcf on a 
year-over-year basis, and conditions may not again be as favorable as they 
have been recently for injections for many weeks, or even months, to come. As 
temperatures rise through the end of the month, injections are likely to 
slow, so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of 
approximately 10 Bcf per day. The deficit that stood at an estimated 394 Bcf 
as of the end of May (see Table 2), on an inventory level of approximately 
1,454 Bcf, is expected to rise slightly during June, to 403 Bcf, despite a 
healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month.

With US wellhead supply still running an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf per day 
below year-earlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting 
this decline, even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to 
last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task. Each month in 
which this 400 Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that 
inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October. Injections 
like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this 
pattern to reverse in a significant way, an unlikely event that would occur 
only under very mild weather conditions.

Regional Markets

With the exception of the Rocky Mountains, western differentials have been 
supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power 
generation within the region. This strong demand is pulling supplies from the 
Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity 
utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California. Prices at the 
California border have been particularly strong, averaging over a $0.30 
premium to the Henry Hub so far this month. Continued strong western demand 
looks likely to support prices within the region through July, as power loads 
remain strong and hydroelectric output declines. In addition, the early heat 
waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus, although 
inventories in the region as a whole remain strong (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:

*  Rockies. Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have 
pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region. High utilization rates 
on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the 
rest of the summer. CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry 
Hub of $0.55 per MMBtu.

*  San Juan. The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the 
differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub, and this West 
Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer. CERA expects a 
differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of $0.16 per MMBtu 
during July.

*  Permian and Mid-Continent. As Texas power loads increase, the competition 
from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify. 
Permian differentials, which have been averaging around $0.15 per MMBtu to 
the Henry Hub, should narrow. CERA expects a $0.06 per MMBtu differential for 
July. Mid-Continent supplies should price just below Permian supplies, at an 
$0.08 per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub.

*  Chicago. Chicago differentials continue to trade around $0.05 per MMBtu to 
the Henry Hub, and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region 
could put some upward pressure on those differentials, ample seasonal 
pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure. CERA expects a July 
differential of $0.06 per MMBtu.

*  Northeast. New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this 
summer, namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of $4.00 
gas. The result has been differentials above $0.30 from Transco Station 65 
but closer to $0.30 from the Henry Hub. As power generation load reaches its 
peak, however, differentials can rise even in summer. Short-lived power load 
peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the $0.40s, but for the 
month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average $0.34.

Canadian Markets-Demand
Still Down

Canadian demand continues to be down on a year-over-year basis. Volumes on 
TransCanada Pipeline are 400 MMcf below levels at this time last year, and 
Alberta demand is 200 MMcf below; both of these reductions are primarily 
storage related. Weak storage injections, driven in large part by the lack of 
an adequate summer-winter price spread, continue to place inventories further 
behind 1999 levels. Although inventories are still well above the five-year 
average, unless injections increase, it is more likely that end-of-season 
inventories will be comparable to the five-year average (450 Bcf) rather than 
to 1999 levels (484 Bcf).

Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year. Thus far in 
June, flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to 1999, while PG&E GT-NW 
is currently operating 300 MMcf higher. Demand on the West Coast is expected 
to continue this trend for the summer.

Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with 1999 levels. An 
outage pattern similar to last year's has emerged. TCE/NOVA has had 
maintenance projects ongoing in June, but the supply reduction is primarily 
the result of plant turnarounds. Thus far in June, reductions in supply 
because of maintenance have been as high as 850 MMcf but should average 300 
MMcf for the month. Even though June is expected to be flat year-over-year, 
the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than 1999 maintenance 
reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred. 
Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the 
year, largely in the fourth quarter, as a result of the increased level of 
drilling. The annual average supply is expected to be around 100 MMcf per day 
higher than in 1999 as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and 
modest growth in British Columbia (again primarily later in the year), as 
well as the new production from!
 Ft. Liard that is now onstream.

The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada. AECO is 
expected to average C$5.15 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.69 per MMBtu) for June 
with a differential in the low US$0.60s. July is expected to average C$5.44 
per GJ (US$3.90 per MMBtu). The Henry-to-AECO differential is likely to 
remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand.

Subject: FERC Meeting This Morning - Order on El Paso Capacity Allocation



Chairman Hoecker announced that FERC will hold a special meeting Nov. 1 to 
issue a proposed order detailing possible remedies to the California 
wholesale market based on two investigations currently underway.

Only one item was discussed - an order resolving the Amoco complaint over El 
Paso's capacity allocation.  In the order, the Commission finds that El 
Paso's allocation of delivery point capacity at Topock is unjust & 
unreasonable.  The Commission directs El Paso to assign primary point rights 
to its shippers using a one-time assignment process outlined in the order.  
If elections for primary point capacity exceed available space, El Paso will 
pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an 
iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their 
firm capacity rights.  Chairman Hoecker said this case illustrates the fact 
that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the 
overbooking of airline capacity.

FYI...I spoke with Craig Carley at Reliant this morning.  On contract #22538, 
there was not a discount requested therefore September was at Max Rate.  For 
October, I told him the spreads are still above Max Rate and he is in 
agreement.  November...hmmm...above Max Rate?!?!

Title: Reaching New Heights
Author: N. American Natural Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Watch
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1235 ,

Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.

Well believe it or not, it's almost Fall again.  And, of course, that means 
time for back to school, football, cooler weather (that means under 100 
degrees in Houston) and our annual marketing affiliate compliance seminar.

While we hold these sessions on an annual basis to ensure our continued 
compliance with FERC's standards of conduct, the session will not simply be a 
repeat of last year's materials.  Each year we try to focus on new aspects of 
the rules.  This year our sessions will focus on:

? Maintaining our web site in compliance with the rules
? Handling e-mail requests and inquiries from marketing affiliates
? The implications of new electronic tools - EOL, eThink, etc.

In addition, we have prepared some fun video examples to illustrate day to 
day application of the rules.

The session will last only 1 hour from 8:30 - 9:30 AM in 5C2.  Last year you 
let me know that you expected refreshments - so I'm happy to report that 
donuts and coffee will be served.

All Houston-based marketing, finance and operations staff receiving this 
e-mail need to attend a session on Tuesday, October 10.  This session is 
designed to address specific issues which are concerns for these groups.

Michelle,

=09I forget that you started with the team after I quit working on the TW A=
greements; here's a brief update on what our "normal" process was previousl=
y.  We can change anything if you've found a better process...

The Deal Capture Team (Craig & Esther) processes all FTS discount related a=
mendments for TW Marketing.  The Contract Group processes the new (base) ag=
reement and any POI/MDQ/TERM type changes.  All FTS service requests still =
go to Contracts and, after the Capacity/Credit issues are completed and the=
 contract printed out, the entire contract folder is forwarded to Deal Capt=
ure for additional processing (all firm contracts/amendments get sent to De=
al Capture for review).  Deal Capture gets with the Marketer to determine i=
f a Discount is being offered and then creates the Discount Amendment, Rout=
es it for approval (if needed) and Tenders all documents to the Shipper.  D=
eal Capture is responsible for obtaining all approvals other than Capacity =
and Credit.  When (if) the Agreement is executed and returned by the Shippe=
r, Deal Capture will handoff the original documents back to Contracts for a=
ctivation and to complete all additional distribution and processing.  Let =
me know if you have any concerns or questions.  As the first few deals go t=
hrough, we'll need your feedback to see if the process needs some adjustmen=
ts.  Thanks for all your help...

Craig

I just spoke to my tech, Joe Martinez out of Pampa, and he says Oneok/Energas has installed a new meter at the Horn McClure 0006510.  Do you know anything of this? We need to set it up and he needs a POI.  The number I will give it is 0006509 but I will need other info if you can locate it for me. This meter started taking gas the 31st of October, 2001. We have the on reading and the current off read so all gas should be accounted and go into Feb. data if possible. Thanks for any assistance...sig

Pete,
I appreciate your response.  While I certainly understand your position, 
please know that we were careful in choosing the date and time, balancing the 
need to conduct the workshop as soon as practicable with the need to 
accomodate the commercial activities of our customers.  We were told by a 
number of parties that by the last day of the month, most of the next month's 
business has been done.  We also set it up for later in the day to accomodate 
morning trading.

Given your personal experience in these matters and Conoco's involvement in 
gas and electric matters across the county, I really hope that you can find 
time to participate in our workshop.  If not, certainly your efforts to date 
to bring certain questions and issues to our attention have been very 
helpful.  We look forward to working with you on this and other projects in 
the future.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jeff,

Conoco would like to participate in the referenced conference, but because
the meeting is scheduled on August 31st, during gas bid-week, we will most
likely be unable to attend.  However, given the importance of this meeting
to all of TW's shippers, we suggest that consideration be given to
rescheduling the meeting to a later time when all interested parties have an
unhindered opportunity to attend.  This would allow TW to seek input from
the largest possible number of its customers.

We look forward to actively participating in the development of this
proposed service.  Additionally, please place me on the distribution list
for future correspondence.

Sincerely,

Pete Frost
Manager of Regulatory Affairs
Conoco Gas and Power Marketing

Transwestern is seeking your assistance in conducting a workshop on its
proposed Transport Options Program.  We are asking a small group of our
business partners representing a cross section of Transwestern's customer
base to help us resolve some of the remaining details of the program.
During the 2-hour workshop, Transwestern will attempt to answer questions
raised by its customers following the original rollout of the program a
couple of weeks ago.  It is hoped that following the workshop, we can put
the finishing touches to a service offering that merits the support of those
involved in the workshop group as well as the FERC and Transwestern's
shippers.  We ask that you send both a commercial representative as well as
a regulatory or legal representative in order that we can address the full
range of issues affecting this proposed filing.  Below are the details of
the meeting:

Double Tree Hotel
400 Dallas Street
Houston, TX  77002
(713) 759-0202

Meeting Room: Fannin Room, 2nd Floor
Date: Thursday, August 31, 2000
 Time:  2:00 - 4:00 p.m.
 Coffee, soft drinks and snacks will be provided

RSVP your company's attendance by telephone or Email to Jeff Fawcett at

Shelley,
I'm glad we made the decision to participate in today's drafting session.  =
There were only nine of us involved, with Ed Ross, Skip Simmons and Craig C=
hancellor representing the generators, while Byron White, Georgia Carter an=
d myself were there to represent the pipelines.  The others were with the A=
lliance.  Ed was his usual self.  He was confidently making the good econom=
ic case why the pipelines should consider the generator's position and how/=
why the FERC would likely side with them.  Craig tried to frame it commerci=
ally, and Skip played peacemaker.  Byron and I played a little "good cop/ba=
d cop" on behalf of the pipes, with Byron being the bad cop. =20

Anyway, sum and substance, I think we'll be more pleased with the next draf=
t of this document than what was submitted to us recently.   The first sent=
ence was replaced with a more sweeping statement of intent and mission of t=
he parties that focused on the provisioning of the service being subject to=
 physical operating considerations.  There emerged a realization that maybe=
 two products are being contemplated here:  (1) a product that blocks out a=
 period of time for uniform deliveries (say, 8 hours), and (2) a product th=
at basically provides the generator an option on when to take the agreed up=
on block of capacity.  It was agreed that the first product is likely to be=
 less valuable than the second, and priced accordingly.  Byron and I argued=
 that segmenting hourly rights should not be mandated, and in fact, may be =
physically impossible along some locations of the pipeline.  The generators=
 originally intended segmenting as possibly relating to how the NURF rights=
 were carved up by hour, (ex. an 8 hr. block of 5,000/d could be repackaged=
 as two 8 hr. blocks of 2,500/d).  I'm not sure whether we got consensus th=
ere or not -- we'll have to see the next draft.

The big ticket items (nos. 8, 9) got the most press.  I was troubled by the=
 generators' interpretation of both.  In the case of no. 8, the generators =
wanted to predesignate a mechanism whereby an existing customer holding a f=
irm service (whether FT, NNS or storage) could, pursuant to the conversion =
formula, remarket their original firm service as NURF.  The generators were=
 looking at this provision as "throwing a bone" to existing customers who m=
ight want to compete with the pipeline for NURF service using capacity (ex.=
 seasonal) that may not be fully utilized.  Obviously, the predetermined co=
nversion factor was a huge problem for the pipelines, as well as the whole =
notion of trying to fit a round peg into a square hole (ie. two or more dif=
ferent product types).  We pointed out the services were all different, and=
 in fact, any combination of those services, conceivably, could be repackag=
ed under today's rules and sold as a proxy for NURF.  I believe we were suc=
cessful in taming that language down substantially.  However, be on the loo=
kout for the next draft.

Finally, with respect to no. 9, where the generators want receipts consider=
ed rateable with deliveries for purposes of NURF, the generators had an int=
ersting slant.  Essentially, Ed was saying that he didn't want the pipeline=
s to hold the generators hostage on rates for NURF if the pipelines were th=
e only ones who could offer NURF.  By requiring the pipelines to consider r=
ateable receipts as meeting the NURF criteria, then Ed said the generators =
would receive the benefits of a competitive marketplace for "NURF-like" ser=
vice.  Skip pointed out that taking gas out of storage at Westar in West Te=
xas and using it as an hour by hour offset for deliveries to a power plant =
located at the California border was probably unworkable.  However, he also=
 posed the hypothet that if SoCalGas were to provide the same storage servi=
ce at the California border and those deliveries into SoCalGas could be adj=
usted to take into account the deliveries to the power plant (a sort of div=
ersion of gas theory), then the pipeline should be operationally indifferen=
t to whether it was providing NURF service or a 3rd party was providing a N=
URF-like service.  They just want others to have the ability to compete wit=
h the pipeline.

Of course, the pipeline argued that operationally those products may not be=
 the same.  Moreover, accepting such a nomination from SoCalGas could conce=
ivably knock off other uses of the capacity the pipeline was counting on (I=
T, LFT, etc.) as an offset which gave rise to the lower rate for the pipeli=
ne's NURF service.  Skip scratched out a more tame version of no. 9, and Ed=
 agreed to consider it.  Be on the lookout for what they come up with.

Overall, as I said, I'm glad I was there, as well as the other pipeline rep=
resentatives.  I hope that we were successful in getting the generators bac=
k on track here.  I'll be interested in seeing how much of our discussion t=
oday is embodied in the next generator draft.

I told the group they were in trouble on Thursday, as we were sending in th=
e "A" team.  Good luck and call if you have any questions.=20

Last Friday, I faxed you a copy of the latest strawman for a NURF service w=

Kim and Lindy,

It looks like the timing on Flow Direction requirements should be around Sept. 1st. I got copies on the meeting notes rom Michelle after Steve's staff meeting today. I know Lindy is back on Thursday, then I will be out the following week of Aug. 6th - 13th. I have some hand outs from some of our previous meetings last year that we can start with.
Please give me a call when you return Lindy.
Thanks Ramona

Dennis,

I do not have anything documented in any detail yet. Lindyis out on vacation & I lknow I will be reviewing the requirments with her. I will be working on the flow direction requirements over the next 2 to 3 maybe 4 weeks. After discussing with Hasan, we plan to implement in the December / January time frame so that it moves in with TW's new contract system.This Flow Direction Project was part of the TW 2001 system enhancement budget dollars. I know that at the CMS status update meeting last week Lisa noted these two items for TW. Also noted was a comment about needing the details on the Winthin and Outside the path . The Within and Outside the  path is already coded in the current CBS system and PLE system. You should be able to pull from the current system the process. I know it will need to merge into the new system. The basic concept is as Follows:

All points on TW are tied to a Marketing Lateral code.
This code is stored in PLE for each point on TW
A Batch Process is set up in CBS that is a stored procedure that runs everyday at 12:00 noon to calculate the inside/outside the paths on all firm contracts. (Release, FTS3, FTS1, LFT, EFBH). This process finds the marketing lateral for the primary receipt and primary delivery pionts & identifies all possible laterals between the primary receipt to primary delivery that can be valid alternate points inside the path and stores those to be used in the allocation process. It maps it out for each firm contract. This process is uses the valid  marketing laterals to build the inside alternate paths. Any contract whose alternate receipt or alternate delvery point that is not in the valid available marketing lateral is an outside the path transaction. TMS uses this process in the allocations on TW.
With revalidation the TMS system checks for contracts that change primary receipt points and delivery points in the evening, nongrid, I/ D1 , and I/D2 cycles. However the stored procedure batch job is a maunal process, the contract team would submit this batch job on demand so that it can identify the valid marketing laterals for that specific contract that was changed. I would like to see this automated with the new CMS system. Each time a firm contract is changed for a gas day after the timely cycle is run, this batch job or stored procedure should automaticly rum again for that contract that was changed.

Thanks Ramona

Dennis,

I noticed on Ramona's bullets she was working with Marketing and Contracts on the TW flow direction business requirements.  Are you in the loop on this?  If not could you please let her know that you need to be in the loop and see if there is anything documented as of yet on this?  I would like to see some type of documentation as soon as possible.

Thanks

Linda

Rob,

I have some information as it relates to supplying power plants.  For instance my CA Interstate Capacity Report includes several interstate pipeline projects intended to serve these plants.  Kern River has at least 3 projects filed including the High Desert Lateral project which will serve the High Desert Power Project.  

Also some time ago I distributed to Marketing, Regulatory and others a copy of the CEC's Final Draft Report on California's Natural Gas Infrastructure.  This report is still not final however a portion of it includes these seven projects as part of the overall demand basis for additional interstate pipeline capacity.  Virtually the same information was included in the CEC's presentation at the CPUC's own workshop on Natural Gas Infrastructure last April (Jeff F. from Marketing also attended workshop).  

I haven't followed these projects individually at the CEC however I'll call Michele to make sure she has the information listed above and ask her if she needs further assistance in obtaining any other pertinent data.

Here are some potential opportunities in California that could be served off PG&E.  I am trying to verify whether these projects are still filed with the CEC.  The meeting is scheduled for next Tuesday at 9:00.  Thanks.

Lindy -  We receive a report from IGS which does track the California 
deliveries of Kern River.  The remaining volumes, and we do assume that Kern 
River is 100% full, does get dropped off to the Nevada market.    Sometimes, 
the California deliveries are as low as 325 MMcf/d, which does indicate a 
strong Las Vegas/Nevada market demand.

Kern River's throughput to CA was only 59%?  Did they have an outage?  Is the 
remaining gas dropping-off before CA?  We usually assume in our gas flows 
analysis that Kern is 100% full.  This seems unusual.

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated this afternoon on the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
Citizens K #20822 Res - flowed alternate deliveries to Socal Needles of 32,145 dth and should be billed incremental fees [I have prepared a spreadsheet to calculate at the max applicable tariff rate for the alternate path]
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item

	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles "window" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.  

	Thanks. Lynn

Kim,
Thanks again to you and Lorraine for a wonderful time at lunch yesterday. I
hope we can do it on a much more regular basis. Here is the web site with
the CEC report I was referring to yesterday. I think this is a useful
reference; the FERC is giving it some serious thought as well.

The question came up yesterday whether a shipper who contracts for firm 
capacity for a year or more at a negotiated rate is entitled to a ROFR.

I've done some checking, and the answer is no, a negotiated rate shipper that 
entered into a contract after March 27, 2000 does not automatically get ROFR 
rights.   This was clearly stated by FERC in Order No. 637-A.   It does not 
matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate; the 
contract is still not considered to be "at maximum rates" for ROFR purposes.

As you know, our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include ROFR 
rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get ROFR 
rights.  

Any questions -- let me know.

USGT
Sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of Daily Firm space moving gas for the weekend from PG&E 
Topock to SoCal Needles at $.10/MMBtu.  This was somewhat of a novel deal in 
that the California price spreads opened up and gas became trapped at PG&E.  
Once our station 4 compressor becomes fully operational, this opportunity 
will likely dry up.  

Enron N.A.
Representatives contacted us this week to discuss our possible participation 
in a gas storage field using a depleted reservoir on Navajo land near 
Farmington, NM.  Third party developers approached ENA looking for assistance 
in moving the project forward.

New Tariff Services
Marketing consensus was reached to delay any further development of 
Transwestern's Hourly Firm Service until the potential markets of power plant 
loads become operational.  During this interim period, Park 'n Ride services 
provided on an intra-day basis shall be priced incrementally higher than Park 
'n Ride services provided on a timely basis.  Any resulting market response 
will provide indications of market willingness to pay premium transport rates 
for hourly transportation service.

El Paso 
El Paso Merchant Services needs to re-scrub their verbal offer to 
Transwestern of a $15 Million lump sum "pre-payment" option of fuel 
monetization for their combined 65,000 MMBtu/d of San Juan to California 
capacity.  El Paso did not take into consideration the different termination 
dates of the two contracts (25,000 MMBtu/d PG&E permanent release contract, 
and 40,000 MMBtu/d Gallup expansion contract) in their analysis.  A revised 
proposed lump sum payment offer is expected mid-next week.

El Paso Field Services
Met with EP representatives to discuss a possible interconnect near WT-1.  
The I/C would be sized for 40,000 MMBtu/d.  EP proposes to pay for and set 
compression to flow this gas into our high pressure line and has agreed to a 
volume commitment of 20,000 MMBtu/d for up to 2 years.  An added advantage is 
most of the volume would come from the constrained Atoka area which would 
allow Agave to increase deliveries to TW.

Caithness Corp.
Caithness has decided to move forward on their 1000 Mw generation project in 
Northwest Arizona.  The 2-phase project would initially consume 80,000 
MMBtu/d of gas.  The proposed location is 40 miles south of TW's line near 
Wickieup, AZ.  We are meeting with Caithness reps next week.  Projected 
in-service date for the plant is early 2002.

WT-2 Cooler Expansion
Level B cost estimates are being prepared.  Revenue / cost savings 
assumptions predict $500,000 annual revenue to support the expenditure.  Once 
installed, the project would give TW an additional 50,000 MMBtu/d capacity on 
the east end.  Financial evaluations will be done once the cost estimate is 
received.

NGPL Winkler Interconnect
NGPL notified us this week the reactivated point should be operationally 
ready to flow gas on July 17 (about 2 weeks ahead of schedule).  This will 
hopefully provide new system supply to TW's east end of about 80 - 
90,000/MMBtu/d.

FERC's action here appears to be the appropriate remedy.  You know it's a 
good fix if the utilities and Senator Feinstein don't like it!


FERC Restructures California Power Market
Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the 
brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of 
remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their 
control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate 
bilateral forward contracts. 
The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after 
the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California 
utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange 
(Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market. 
FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties 
in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts. 
"California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market," Chairman 
James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called 
"crisis by design." The design was "an unworkable state law, the product of 
command and control that described in detail" exactly how the market should 
function. "It wasn't competition," Hoecker said. "It's time to get serious 
about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in 
principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never 
well-conceived or tried. This version of competition was a disaster." 
Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's backing away from price caps.  "Rather than cap the spot market 
created by the state of California, the order would simply shrink its size 
and diminish its influence." This will "give back participants' ability to 
find the right price; This ability is what California has taken away from 
that market." 
Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions, support forward 
contracts, and allow the parties to manage risk.  He urged the California 
Public Utilities Commission to "step up to its responsibilities" in 
supporting the FERC-directed activities. 
Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the "apocalypse" 
in California "is absolutely staggering. The two largest utilities are 
virtually bankrupt."  He predicted a court, acting on accepted law and 
precedent, would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the 
costs from customers, spreading the costs out over the entire state. 
PG&E Corp. officials lambasted the Commission's actions, saying they left 
California's electric customers "exposed to price gouging and future electric 
supply reliability uncertainty." 
"The California wholesale market is broken. And we are extremely disappointed 
by the insufficiency of today's FERC order," PG&E officials said in a 
statement. "The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to 
provide a solution that ensures reliability of the state's electric supply 
and equally importantly, provides relief from future price gouging," the 
Northern California utility company said. PG&E said it was particularly 
disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for 
California electric customers, as was requested by Gov. Gray Davis. The 
utility also said it was "especially troubled" that FERC shortened the 
timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of 2002 to April 2001, 
"leaving customers exposed during the high-demand summer season." 
Sen Dianne Feinstein, (D-CA), said FERC's action was unacceptable. "Rome is 
burning, our utilities are close to bankruptcy, Californians are facing major 
blackouts, and the Commission is fiddling." 
Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest 
have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps. But he 
pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that 
region. For one, it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and 
other federal operations there, which make up a major portion of the market. 
Further, there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps 
operate in California. There also would be problems with the many purchasers 
who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way. Hoecker strongly 
urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to 
identify regional problems, and offered his help in this. 
Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring 
opinions. Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items 
such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order. The Commission's 
actions, which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 2), came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous 
power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state. 
The Commission's reforms call for: 
_ No retroactive refunds for California customers; 
_ Elimination of the requirement that California's three investor-owned 
utilities --- Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison --- sell all of their power into the Cal-PX, and 
buy all of their power from the Cal-PX. This took effect Friday; 
_ Return 25,000 MW of generation to state regulation; 
_ Termination of the Cal-PX wholesale rate schedule effective the close of 
the trading day on April 30, 2001; 
_ Create a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts to assess prices 
of five-year energy supply contracts; 
_ Create penalties for underscheduling power loads; 
_ A requirement that market participants schedule 95% of their load prior to 
real time. Violators will incur penalties for scheduling deviations exceeding 
the greater of 10 MW or 5% of their hourly load; 
_ Begin market monitoring and price mitigation for the Cal-ISO and PX spot 
markets. FERC will hold a technical conference to develop a monitoring an 
mitigation program. A proposed plan is to be submitted by March 1 so that the 
measure can be in place by May 1; 
_ A single-priced auction to be used only for bids at or below $150/MW. Bids 
above $150/MW will not set the market clearing price, although they will be

We met with Rick Dietz and the Contract Admin group today regarding contract 
admin processes for "regular" TW deals and the upcoming EnronOnline deals.

For the regular deals:

Primary Contract Admin person is Michelle Cormier, backup by Dennis Lee.
Michelle Lokay will essentially take over the admin duties previously handled 
by Christine Stokes including generating discount letters and inputting rates 
in the system.  Backup will be handled by TK Lohman, Kevin Hyatt, and Craig 
Buehler.
The contract log and previous "firm book report" will be replaced by the 
automated "Transactional Report" from the contract system.
We will also look at establishing a "general" mailbox to which customers can 
send contract change requests.  This way multiple team members can access the 
box and handle the requests.


For On-line Deals

Michelle Lokay is the primary contact working with Michelle Cormier.  
Counter-parties will not receive a paper contract but will be get a 
confirming email.
Credit will be have already been approved as part of the online process.
Michelle Lokay will print the screen once a deal has been lifted and route 
that to Contract Admin for input to the system.
M. Cormier will generate the contract number so it can be emailed to the 
customer.


Let me know if you have questions.
thanks
kh

There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to 
Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The 
middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I 
have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or 
materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that 
they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of 
January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate 
and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks

Subject: Re: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner 
notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also 
the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so 
should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances 
Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we 
will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  
Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, 
flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The 
chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility 
without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just 
want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three 
weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a 
couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good 
gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work 
order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  
Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, 
etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will 
operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still 
possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it 
including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF 
down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the 
facilities asap.

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on 
the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded 
like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What 
will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I 
can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a 
chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut 
in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the 
station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and 
also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as 
things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Please write-off the balances held on the contracts listed below. I cannot 
find any current information to verify the existence or final resolution of 
account balances for the subject contracts.  A review of our billing records 
reflects that the contracts have not been invoiced since December 1998.  The 
net loss of revenue will be negligible compared to the ill will that would be 
generated in attempting to bill these all-but-forgotten, year and a half old 
P&R quantities. 

The monthly invoicing file now tracks P&R quantities carried over from month 
to month. This practice should prevent this problem from occurring in the 
future.  

Note: There are currently two shippers with P&R balances that have carried 
over from previous months. - Reliant PO# 27060 has 1,514 MMBtu parked at POI# 
500621 since April 2000  and Sempra  PO# 27255 has 6,000 MMBtu parked at POI# 
500615 since June 2000.  We will work with Darrell to get these quantities 
returned to these shippers.

Richard, today I gave Mike Bodnar  the PNR contracts listed below to review.  
I'll let you know what the "fix" will be once the Storage desk decide what 
needs to be done; write-off, bill, or maybe even netting two of the contracts.

More info.  Apparently, all's not necessarily roses here.  The main issue 
Enron has with the FERC order is the bifurcated (two-tiered) auction 
program.  If the auction bids are less than $150/MW, they are presumed to be 
market clearing.  If above $150, they must show cost basis to support the 
price.  For purposes of this analysis, "costs" will not include purchase 
costs (ie. wholesale price paid), rather, they must be generation costs.

Enron is considering what forum would be appropriate to address the 
deficiency of the FERC order.  It is a contentious issue on all sides and 
there's likely to be vigorous debate.

Subject: FERC restructures Cal-ISO

FERC's action here appears to be the appropriate remedy.  You know it's a 
good fix if the utilities and Senator Feinstein don't like it!


FERC Restructures California Power Market
Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the 
brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of 
remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their 
control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate 
bilateral forward contracts. 
The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after 
the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California 
utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange 
(Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market. 
FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties 
in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts. 
"California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market," Chairman 
James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called 
"crisis by design." The design was "an unworkable state law, the product of 
command and control that described in detail" exactly how the market should 
function. "It wasn't competition," Hoecker said. "It's time to get serious 
about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in 
principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never 
well-conceived or tried. This version of competition was a disaster." 
Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's backing away from price caps.  "Rather than cap the spot market 
created by the state of California, the order would simply shrink its size 
and diminish its influence." This will "give back participants' ability to 
find the right price; This ability is what California has taken away from 
that market." 
Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions, support forward 
contracts, and allow the parties to manage risk.  He urged the California 
Public Utilities Commission to "step up to its responsibilities" in 
supporting the FERC-directed activities. 
Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the "apocalypse" 
in California "is absolutely staggering. The two largest utilities are 
virtually bankrupt."  He predicted a court, acting on accepted law and 
precedent, would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the 
costs from customers, spreading the costs out over the entire state. 
PG&E Corp. officials lambasted the Commission's actions, saying they left 
California's electric customers "exposed to price gouging and future electric 
supply reliability uncertainty." 
"The California wholesale market is broken. And we are extremely disappointed 
by the insufficiency of today's FERC order," PG&E officials said in a 
statement. "The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to 
provide a solution that ensures reliability of the state's electric supply 
and equally importantly, provides relief from future price gouging," the 
Northern California utility company said. PG&E said it was particularly 
disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for 
California electric customers, as was requested by Gov. Gray Davis. The 
utility also said it was "especially troubled" that FERC shortened the 
timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of 2002 to April 2001, 
"leaving customers exposed during the high-demand summer season." 
Sen Dianne Feinstein, (D-CA), said FERC's action was unacceptable. "Rome is 
burning, our utilities are close to bankruptcy, Californians are facing major 
blackouts, and the Commission is fiddling." 
Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest 
have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps. But he 
pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that 
region. For one, it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and 
other federal operations there, which make up a major portion of the market. 
Further, there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps 
operate in California. There also would be problems with the many purchasers 
who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way. Hoecker strongly 
urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to 
identify regional problems, and offered his help in this. 
Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring 
opinions. Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items 
such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order. The Commission's 
actions, which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 2), came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous 
power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state. 
The Commission's reforms call for: 
_ No retroactive refunds for California customers; 
_ Elimination of the requirement that California's three investor-owned 
utilities --- Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison --- sell all of their power into the Cal-PX, and 
buy all of their power from the Cal-PX. This took effect Friday; 
_ Return 25,000 MW of generation to state regulation; 
_ Termination of the Cal-PX wholesale rate schedule effective the close of 
the trading day on April 30, 2001; 
_ Create a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts to assess prices 
of five-year energy supply contracts; 
_ Create penalties for underscheduling power loads; 
_ A requirement that market participants schedule 95% of their load prior to 
real time. Violators will incur penalties for scheduling deviations exceeding 
the greater of 10 MW or 5% of their hourly load; 
_ Begin market monitoring and price mitigation for the Cal-ISO and PX spot 
markets. FERC will hold a technical conference to develop a monitoring an 
mitigation program. A proposed plan is to be submitted by March 1 so that the 
measure can be in place by May 1; 
_ A single-priced auction to be used only for bids at or below $150/MW. Bids 
above $150/MW will not set the market clearing price, although they will be 
subject to FERC reporting requirements; 
_ Replacing the current Cal-ISO stakeholder governing board with a 
non-stakeholder board. On Jan. 29, 2001, the Cal-ISO governing board members 
will be required to turn over their decision-making power and operating 
control to the management of the Cal-ISO. The members will be permitted to 
function in an advisory capacity until the new board is selected. FERC to 
discuss with California representatives a process for selecting new Cal-ISO 
board members; and 
_ Modify interconnection procedures.  The ISO and utilities must file 
generation interconnection procedures.

Ranelle,
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner on this.  I do have some questions regarding the attached notice.  What is the counter-offer methodology and when will we use it vs. FCFS.  Our tariff currently allows us to use the NPV methodology and does not state that we can use an alternate methodology.    We need to rewrite the tariff provision.  Until then, we should definitely post the alternate methodology that we plan to use for at least 3 business days in advance.  Drew and Susan and I are supposed to meet on this subject today.  I will get their thoughts as well.  thanks, Maria

Attached is a draft of what could be added to the TW Website's unsubscribed capacity section.  This is similar to what was done for NNG so that if a shipper was looking for unsubscribed capacity on our Website, they would also know we have capacity available on EOL.  The change also indicates that we may be using a different methodology for selling/awarding capacity than we have in our tariff.  What do you think?

FYI--Just in case you didn't get a copy of the announcement, below is the article from Inside FERC with the details of the filing at FERC of the previously announced expansion project to be completed and in-service by May, 2003.  Kern River will more than double their capacity into California by adding 885,626 Mcf/d of capacity.  There's also a related article in todays Gas Daily.  gh
  

KERN RIVER SUBMITS $1.26 BILLION PROJECT TO DOUBLE SYSTEM CAPACITY
With its 2002 Expansion certificate in hand, Kern River Gas Transmission Co. last Wednesday filed
with the commission its next capacity ramp-up, which would more than double the capacity of its 922-mile
gas pipeline system from Opal, Wyo., to California. The 2003 Expansion would bring supplies to a region
of the country that "has experienced well-documented, severe energy shortages," Kern River said.
The $1.26 billion project would add 885,626 Mcf/day of capacity to the 845,000 Mcf/day that will be
available once the 2002 Expansion (CP01-31) is complete (IF, 30 July, 6), said the Aug. 1 application. To
accomplish this, the 2003 Expansion would add 634.3 miles of 36-inch-diameter looping in Wyoming,
Utah, Nevada and California and 82.4 miles of 42-inch-diameter looping of a segment owned jointly with
Mojave Pipeline Co.
The application also calls for a net increase of 163,700 horsepower in compression. The upgrade
includes the construction of three new mainline compressor units - the proposed Coyote Creek station in
Uinta County, Wyo., the Salt Lake station in Salt Lake County, Utah, and the Dry Lake station in Clark
County, Nev. Five existing compressor stations also would be upgraded, and the Daggett compressor
station would be reconfigured to compress only Mojave volumes.
Kern River also plans to build a new meter station under its existing certificate to interconnect Kern
River/Mojave facilities with the 30-inch-diameter Adelanto lateral proposed by Southern California Gas
Co. In response to a request from SoCal Gas, the new Kramer Junction meter station is designed to deliver
up to 500,000 Mcf/day by the planned Dec. 31 in-service date. Although SoCal Gas is committed to
provide only 200,000 Mcf/day of firm access rights from this interconnect, additional takeaway capacity
will be available on an interruptible basis, the application said.
Kern River reported that 18 long-term transportation service agreements have been entered into
with shippers. Following an open season, about 85% of the capacity is contracted for 15-year periods and
the remainder for 10-year periods, the application said. Based upon representations made by the expansion
shippers, nearly all of the capacity is projected to be used to serve existing and new power generation
markets in California.
By far the biggest customer for the capacity would be Reliant Energy Services Inc., which signed a 15-
year agreement for 200,000 Dt/day. The next two largest subscribers are Edison Mission Energy (127,500
Dt/day) and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing L.P. (90,000 Dt/day).
The expansion's proposed initial daily incremental rate on a 100%-load-factor basis, excluding fuel, is
70?/Dt for 10-year firm service and 56.8?/Dt for 15-year firm service. In addition, the 2003 Expansion
shippers would be responsible for paying a fuel in-kind reimbursement factor of 3.05% for volumes
transported from Wyoming to California; the rates would be lower for shorter trips.
As for supply, given the large volume of remaining reserves and the amount of drilling activity in the
Rocky Mountain region, production could increase by more than 1.5 Bcf/day over the next year and by
4.5 Bcf/day over the next five years, according to a report prepared for Kern River by Barlow and Haun Inc.
In addition to the gas available from processing plants directly connected to Kern River in southwest-ern
Wyoming, shippers have access to supplies from other regions via Northwest Pipeline Corp., Colorado
Interstate Gas Co. and Questar Pipeline Co. at the Opal/Muddy Creek market center, the application said.
Two additional interstate pipelines - Wyoming Interstate Co. Ltd. and Overthrust Pipeline Co. - an-nounced
related open seasons in June that could result in interconnects providing access to supplies from
the Wind River and Wamsutter basins, the pipeline noted.
To meet the project's May 1, 2003, in-service date, Kern River asked the commission to issue a prelimi-nary
determination on nonenvironmental matters by Feb. 1, 2002, and a full certificate by May 1, 2002.

Michelle,

Would you please write up a full description of what the scope of our plans are with PG&E.  This description will be useful to Kevin Howard as he proceeds to determine the best way to secure funds for this project.  Please send it to me and I will add the virtual capacity write up to it and forward on to Kevin.

Thanks, Kim.

Michelle:  here are the provisions that could be added to appendix A of the service agreement or, if this is objectionable for some reason, put in a letter agreement (similar in form to a discount letter).  I've italicized provisions that NSS suggested but which I don't think we should agree to.

The existing capacity of this system is 38 mmcf/d.
Now that we know where the exactl location of the tie-in is and based on  your input I have created two flow modeling options for this project::
 
Option-1:
Assuming 30 mmcf/d from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can do another 12 mmcf/d from Conoco at 576 psig pressure for a total of     42 mmcf/d. If the pressure at Lanam Ranch reduces, it will change the capacity to a lower figure. 
  			

  Option-2:
  Assuming 0 (zero) from Lanam Ranch, the Monument Station can handle 62 mmcf/d from Conoco at 696 psig pressure.

						


If the pressure at Conoco reduces, it will create higher differential pressure at monument and that will reduce the capacity.
If you have any comments please e-mail me as soon as you can so we can finalize the capacity of this system.

Subject:	RE: ConocoProjReqForm.xls

 1 What is the legal description of this tie- in? Northeast corner of R35E, T20S, Section 24

  2) What is the maximum pressure that Conoco can provide at this point?  Per Conoco, max sustainable pressure would be 700#

  3) If the volume from Conoco is going to be 60 mmcf/d, how much gas are you planning to flow from the existing Lanam Ranch interconnect ( 0 to 30 mmcfd range)
	We would only flow 60mm from Conoco if Linam was delivering 0.   Conoco would be the "swing" supplier" based on what Linam was giving to TW.  If you determine that with Conoco's interconnect location and operating pressure that the Monument line and compressors would do 75mm (for example), and Linam gives us 20mm, then we theoretically could take 55mm from Conoco.

  4) What is the pressure commitment at Lanam Ranch  - Per Darrel, at over 620#, we start to hit the pressure regulator for the Class III shut in valve, so plan on no more than 620.

On February 27th, the FERC approved TW's Electronic Contracting filing to become effective March 4, 2002.  We made the filing to correspond with the implementation of the new contracting system in Market Services.  Shippers can still contract via fax and in writing; however, they will now (I believe after this coming weekend) by able to do requests and contracting electronically.  This include capacity release.  There were a few minor changes in the shipper requests requirements, but I believe most of these were already occurring; we just updated the tariff language.  

One change which is very different is that a service agreement must be signed and returned within 15 days instead of 30 days. 

If you have any questions, please call myself (x54600) or Teb (x36868).

Additional suppliers on Transwestern in the San Juan area are Red Cedars and Williams Field Services.  Our contacts there are Ed Meaders at 970-382-7394 and Charlie Brown at 918-574-9297.  I had mentioned Public Service of New Mexico (PNM) earlier, but their production is usually taken off our system versus delivered into our San Juan area.  Hope this helps!

Hi Beth,
	According to the engineers, minimum pipeline delivery pressure would likely be 750 psi at the Panda interconnect.  Let me know if you have questions.  

talk with you soon.

Michelle, 

Per our conversation on January 2, please assign 3735/dth of available
West Texas Pool receipts for contract 27641 during the four months
beginning November, 2002 and ending February, 2003.  We will continue to
look for the remaining 2000.


As for Amendment 3 which increased our West Texas receipts to 14265
during the period described above, I do not see anything.  Can you send
me another copy and I will get that signed today.  Sorry for the
confusion.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Best Regards
David

Please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.1020 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $71,400 [$0.1020 x 25,000 x 28days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $56,700 [($0.1020 - $0.0210) x 25,000 x 28 days] Amy -  please do an adjustment of the capacity release rate by inputting a discount of $0.0210 for this line item on the manual invoice.  
Richard - When payment is received from Burlington for their acquisition, please process the credit amount of $14,700 to ENA.
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $14,700 [$0.0210 x 25,000 x 28 days]  Richard - Has a separate account been established for these revenues?

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Texaco K #25923/25924 Comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4.5% between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes, there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding.  Need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes; and if delivery makeup scheduled, then invoice should be adjusted accordingly.

Please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2/26/02.  I will review again on the 1st.  

Schedulers -  Please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [some contracts are based on calculations, especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage].

Michelle,
Do you have any record/recollection of East Flow contracts/capacity that may have terminated and/or became available in the six month period, say from Sept. '00 through Feb. '01?  I recall that Enervest and ENA (32/8 MMcf/d respectively) became available on Jan. 1.  Other examples?  PG&E Trading?  I need a complete (as possible) list of when they came available.  Based on an earlier conversation with Perry, I don't think there was necessarily a reflection of the availability on the board inasmuch as the capacity was probably already showing available.  Can you work with me to get this info?

Lorna,
Sources close to Kern River confirmed with me just yesterday that the=20
original expansion (124,500 MMBtu/d) is being contracted principally by one=
=20
party, PG&E National Energy Group, for their La Paloma Power Project outsid=
e=20
of Bakersfield, California.  I'm assuming that additional support for a 2nd=
=20
KRGT expansion will come from other developers interested in securing gas=
=20
supply. =20

It's important to remember the economics here --- Kern River's pipeline=20
originates in Wyoming (Rockies gas) and delivers directly into Southern=20
California.  Their gas generally clears the market at the Southern Californ=
ia=20
Border index.  Consequently, there is no stacking of rates as would be the=

case if TW or EPNG attempted to deliver their gas through Mojave to the sam=

Elizabeth,
Thanks.  I don't have access to update rates.  I usually depend on TK to do it.  I'll forward this to Michelle Lokay in the event she does.  If not, maybe Amy does.  I'm out tomorrow, but back in on Monday.  If someone can't help us tomorrow, maybe we can get it fixed on Monday.

The March rate needs to be updated for the path WOT (POI 500179) to EOT.  The rate system still reflects $0.0075 for this path rather than the calculated rate of $0.0121.  Once this is done, please notify one of the schedulers to reverse and rebook for both February and March.  If anyone has questions, please let me know.  

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Thanks a lot, Elizabeth.  I appreciate your help.  Did you happen to recalc the March reservation rates?  If not, I'll need someone to re-run the invoice in order for me to do it.  Just let me know.  Thanks.

Subject:	Re: Transwestern Invoice

Based on the amended discount letter copy you provided me on Friday, I have re-calculated the reservation rate to account for the increase in rate for alternate deliveries West.

The February 2001 reservation invoice should be adjusted from a net rate of $0.0075 to $0.0079 for both primary paths (EOT to EOT and WOT to EOT).  This will mean an additional amount due from USGT of $4,480.

For March 2001 reservation invoice, the calculated rate was updated to $0.0121 for primary path EOT to EOT; however, this rate was not changed for the other primary path WOT to EOT and was billed at the base rate of $0.0075.  This is an additional $10,305 that will need to billed to USGT.

These amounts should fall in line with what USGT was expecting (other than for differences due to rounding of the rates to four decimal places).  Someone in your group will need to update these rates in CBS and notify the scheduler to reverse and rebook for both months.

Please let me know if you need anything further.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Yes, effective February 15, 2001, their East to West flow one-part rate went from $0.04 to $0.15/MMBtu.

I looked at USGT's response below.  Did the rate structure change? If so, when and what are the terms?

Elizabeth,
Apparently USGT disagrees with our invoice (the $10,000 mistake works in our favor).  Is there a way you could take a look at this (or at least help me to do it) in order to reconcile?  USGT also believes our February invoice is wrong.  Call me.   Thanks.

It seems to me that if the capacity is only for the months of Nov-Mar, the 
reference to the discounted rate in section 2 should state that it is for the 
period Nov-Mar through 2010.  Also, the language in paragraph 6 should 
eliminate the reference to the tariff, since we don't have it, just start

Enron OnLine Capacity Auction
Bidding opened on Thursday 6/22; no bids have been received as yet but 
several shippers have indicated interest and plan on responding on Monday 
6/26.  Bids close at 2pm Monday 6/26.  Coincidentally, we received a call 
from Unbound Technology, a developer of wireless software technology.  
UnBound provides software architecture  that creates the connection between 
transaction processes and wireless services.  This potentially would allow TW 
to extend our e-commerce services beyond the desktop  to a wireless user 
through a customized, wireless interface (pagers, cell phones, etc.).  We 
have set a meeting with Unbound for next Wednesday.

Fuel Monetization
Implementation cost estimates are being finalized as customer interest is 
being evaluated for this potential service option.  Duke, Southern, and 
Reliant are all interested but only if they can have first call on the space 
created.  El Paso Merchant Energy is expected to provide Transwestern a 
proposal, early next week, for the potential monetization of the fuel 
component for their company's transportation contracts totaling 65,000 Dth/d 
of San Juan to California capacity.

Southern Company Energy Marketing
John Hogan was in town this week.  Southern has advanced to the second round 
of bidding on Nevada Power's generation assets which are scheduled to be sold 
off by the end of this year.  SCEM's Gallup agreement allows them to deliver 
to the new SWG delivery point on an alternate basis, but if Southern is 
successful in obtaining any of Nevada Power's gen assets, they may request to 
amend the delivery point on their Gallup contract.  SCEM is also very 
interested in any expansions TW may have in the near future.  Due to their 
affiliation with Vastar, they have a definite appetite for more San Juan to 
CA or NV transport.

Southern is interested in the possibility of buying options for capacity on 
TW and we requested that he get his regulatory group familiar with the idea 
in hopes that SCEM would support of our filing.

SCEM also plans to trigger its ROFR on their Ignacio to Blanco capacity 
(30,000/d) by the 7/1 deadline.

Duke
They have triggered their ROFR on the Ignacio to Blanco capacity (18,000/d) 
and this capacity will be posted on the Internet per TW's tariff the week of 
7/3.

Pueblo Project
Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson was excoriated this week in front of 
Senate panels reviewing his and the DOE's conduct regarding the missing 
computer hard drives at Los Alamos.  Since the Pueblo project hinged on the 
ability of Richardson to use his Secretarial discretion to create this sole 
source contract, with limited review by Congress, we can rest assured 
Congressional support for Richardson or any of his pet projects is 
non-existent.

Miscellaneous
Received a call from an irate Houston citizen complaining of "aggressive" 
driving by an 18-wheel motor fuel carrier with "Transwestern" painted on the 
truck.  We assured the caller it was not our truck and recommended he call 
the Tx DOT or sherriff's department.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

 Please take a look at this article.  El Paso's inartful internal documents are creating the same kind of fun for them that Microsoft had during the recent antitrust unpleasantness.  I know that we can't control the way people think about issues such as market behavior, price strategy, etc.  We can, however, remind ourselves and our clients to be very precise and careful in the way we talk about, and particularly, write about, such issues.  I'd like each of us and our clients to keep problems like El Paso's and Microsoft's in mind when we put pen to paper or fingers to keyboard.  Thanks.  df

Business/Financial Desk; Section A
Deal for Use of Gas Pipeline Stirs Dispute on Competition
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN

03/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Early last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved California. 
The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, in total, for bits and pieces.
Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity. 
According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally that the deal would give them ''more control'' of gas markets, including the ''ability to influence the physical market'' to benefit the company's financial positions. 
El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response to California's complaint, said the state ''grossly distorted'' company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context. 
The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric power plants. 
At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize profits. 
More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. 
Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. 
In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering. 
''They are the market maker with this pipeline,'' said Loretta Lynch, the president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. 
El Paso ''sets the price in California,'' Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was intentional. ''It has affected the price,'' she said, ''for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state.'' 
California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant ''has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity'' on the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior. 
The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the ''basis spread'' -- the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end of the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California. 
As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas-New Mexico price in December. 
To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous. 
High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter. 
''The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,'' said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North America. 
Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed company documents. 
''It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy Corporation,'' the utility said in the filing, ''that the business strategy El Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue involved manipulation of price spreads.'' 
The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as the agency's public meeting on Wednesday. 
Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas a day. 
Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement. 
Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a ''gut-wrenching'' decision, Mr. Smith said, but was ''a first-class gesture'' to California. El Paso Merchant paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative. 
''No doubt about it,'' Mr. Clark said, ''we made good money.'' 
The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso denied the accusation. 
With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created soaring profits for energy marketers and traders. 
Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California. 
In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline companies routinely favored affiliates. ''Abuses abound because of financial windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased complexity of the market,'' the company said. 
''There are some red flags right now,'' said William L. Massey, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural gas. El Paso is in all those businesses. 
''What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of affiliate abuse?'' he said. 
Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed. 
''There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,'' said Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which California has brought its complaint about El Paso. 
To its critics, El Paso epitomizes the competitive concerns. It operates the nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market capitalization of $32 billion. 
At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is expected to earn about $1.4 billion. 
El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to ''commodity market and trading margins'' that were enhanced by ''power price volatility, particularly in the Western United States.'' 
Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the bid. 
The presentation outlined what it termed ''strategic advantages,'' including ''more control of total physical markets'' and the ''ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,'' according to the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk. 
For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. 
Under the heading ''Challenges,'' according to the sealed filings, the presentation stated that storage was needed ''to help manipulate physical spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.'' 
On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: ''We will make money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.'' 
The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline -- the load factor -- while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end -- the basis spread. 
In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market. 
Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices. 
The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal regulators, said California's complaint had ''misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted'' what it termed ''snippets of data.'' 
About This Report 
This article and others on California's energy problems are part of a joint effort with the PBS series ''Frontline'' that will result in a documentary later this year.

I have arranged it where if you guys are at the California border and are delivering to another California point, there will not be a charge for fuel.  This will be applicable for Griffith, PG&E, and Needles...

Michelle,
I just wanted to clarify something in your e-mail.  In your note you state the 
fuel is discounted for interruptible transport from Griffith to PG&E.  I 
thought in our conversation you said the fuel for would be discounted for 
deliveries to PG&E and Needles.  Is the fuel discounted to zero for our IT 
deliveries to Needles?  I know it is less reliable, but it provides us with 
another option.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Joe

Joe,
This is to confirm your interruptible transport for the months of July
and August.  The commodity rate from Griffith to PG&E is .2792 and the
commodity from PG&E to Griffith is .2442.  The difference is that one
delivery is California versus east of California (further explanation on
pages 5 and 5a of our tariff).  The fuel will be discounted from 4.5%
down to zero.    Hope this helps.

Western #27834 is .095 (one-part plus fuel), and Western #27835 should only be for 5,000 not 10,000 and is at a rate of .13 (one-part plus fuel).  Oneok is correct at rolling month by month.  TK, please update these rates.  Thanks.

Linda,
I talked with Linda and Michelle this week on this issue. What Michelle 
wanted to know  was does TW have Operators who have PNR agreements. 
Currently, TW does not have any operators with PNR agreements because they 
have mandatory OBAs on TW. With our 637 compliance filing TW is requesting 
that Operators move their imbalance to a PNR if it is over a certin volume.

Also EOG does pool on TW so as a shipper we could get them to enter into a 
PNR. They would need to have a shipper transport it to and from the PNR point.
I also told Michelle that all points the flow any volumes on TW are required 
to be an an OBA.
Michelle said that they were able to resolve this issue with EOG. 

Thanks Ramona

Subject: TW Cash for Fuel Issues

Christine,

After our meeting last week, John, Elizabeth, Gerry, Richard, Dave & I 
discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process. We had 
several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:

Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm 
contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel 
discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this 
special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process 
to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. 
This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at 
this time.

Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items 
that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we 
default these "02" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using 
our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to 
reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the 
volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes 
scheduled & paid for in cash..

Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that "The shipper 
may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a 
receipt point on shipper's service agreement" Does this only apply to the 
shipper's primary receipt points?

I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like 
we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please 
let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Transport Options - On January 9 FERC held a technical conference on TW's 
Transport Options filing.  Along with FERC staff, there were approximately 20 
intervenors present.  Although several of the parties' questions were 
intended to clarify the filing, others used the forum to attack collateral 
issues such as the affiliate marketing rule, pipeline capacity hoarding and 
the market power of Enron Online.  Going forward, TW is due to file pro-forma 
tariff sheets to include several clarifying items by Jan. 26, with parties' 
comments due on Feb. 13 and reply comments due on Feb. 23.

Capacity Marketing - Dynegy purchased several packages of firm transport from 
Blanco to Needles.  One package was 13,500 MMBtu/d for December 2001.  The 
other was 21,500 MMBtu/d for November 1 - December 31, 2002.  We will file 
negotiated rate letters with FERC for the index pricing.

Agave Energy Co. - Met with Agave this week to discuss potential Atoka 
lateral expansion projects and other efforts to bring more producer gas to 
TW's West Texas lateral.  Several opportunities were identified and we have 
scheduled a follow up meeting for February 7th.  In addition, NGPL called to 
set up a meeting next week to look at bringing more gas to us on a firm basis 
in Eddy County; there may be some overlapping volume with Agave here.

Subject: San Juan Efficiencies

All of the studies results to date show the up and down swings of the 
pipeline efficiency.  We have proved that the pipeline can handle 850 MMcf/d 
plus.  However, it has not been tested since the mainline hasn't moved 1090 
MMcf/d yet after Gallup's installation.  Granted it appears that the San Juan 
lateral has some form of irregularity in efficiency along part of the lateral 
and that issue is still under investigation.  Once the lab tests are 
completed we can better determine the next course of action.  Until then we 
still believe that the pipeline is capable of transporting 850 MMcf/d on the 
San Juan lateral at the same time move 1090 MMcf/d to California even though 
the suction pressure to the Gallup station is not as high as it's design.  
Unfortunately we can't test this theory at the worst possible time until next 
summer.  

Several other issues need to be addressed such as the transport of retained 
fuel and increased throughput on the mainline.  Transporting retained fuel is 
highly improbable because Gallup's compressor can only handle a maximum of 
870 MMcf/d at best under good conditions.  EE&CC provided a compressor 
capable of compressing the design volume only with no retained fuel.  
Therefore if we can solve the inlet pressure problem we can compress up  to 
870 which would basically transport the retained fuel.  Until then Gallup can 
only compress as much as possible over the 850 MMcf/d when conditions 
permit.  Increased mainline throughput West of Thoreau based on a higher 
discharge pressure from Gallup is not possible.  Even though the electric 
motor can develop more horsepower than needed, the compressor was designed 
for 850 MMcf/d at 950 psig discharge.  Therefore the unit can not increase 
it's discharge from the design pressure of 950 psig to 970 psig to allow 
increased firm transportation west.

As for the San Juan Lateral pipeline efficiency, we have experienced a powder 
substance in the lateral both times it was pigged.  We don't know the source 
and a good guess is "San Juan Basin".  If that's the case, we need to find a 
way to keep the lateral clean after a good cleaning process has been done.  
What is El Paso doing if they have the same problem?  It's a touchy subject 
to ask them.  If they don't have a problem (or won't admit it) t hen knowing 
we do could be bad for TW.

Even though this was not apart of the main subject, there have been some 
questions regarding if the mainline efficiency has changed (upward) from any 
pigging activities this year.  The only pigging performed was smart pigging 
between Station #4 & #5 for an incroachment issue.  This had no impact on 
efficiencies west to California.  However, Compression Services is actively 
working with Operations to implement recommendations made by Gary Choquette 
(Omaha Facility Planning Team)  for units at Stations 1 & 2 . Once completed 
over the next few weeks, this should improve unit performance and more 
specifically minimize fuel use.  This could have an overall on the system's 
efficiency  but not specifically the pipeline.

Can this be set up to start this weekend, the 9/22?  I will build this product combo for daily, weekly, and definitely monthly.  LaMachina is misspelled (my mistake); the correct spelling should be LaMaquina.  Can the abbreviation for the web be "LaMaquina-IgnacioBlanco"  Thanks!

Michelle,

What Dates do you need set up?  Does the abbreviation for the web look o.k?

US PLCapTW Frm   WFS-IgnacioBlanco (abbreviation)

learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

This Transaction provides firm pipeline transportation capacity from the primary receipt point of West Texas Pool [58646] to the primary delivery point of Oasis Block 16  [8516].  The posted rate, stated in USD/MMBtu on the Website, is a daily one-part rate, inclusive of all applicable reservation, commodity and surcharge rates.

Sold 5,000 MMbtu/d of firm transport to Western Gas Resources from Permian to Topock at .095 plus fuel, generating over $101,000 for the 7 summer months of April through October.
Agreement reached between ENA and TW for capacity for February.  Transwestern, as agent for ENA, released a package of 25,000 MMbtu/day from Ignacio to Blanco to Burlington.  The new contracted max rate of .1020 is .0420 higher than the original rate and will be split 50/50 with ENA.  This will net TW an incremental $14,700, in addition to regaining the original $42,000.
New OBA, containing cash out provision, with Mojave is executed.

With Rod Hayslett's help, I put together an easy excel spreadsheet we can use to quickly evaluate capital investment projects.  It is set up for pipelines but can be modified for power development too.  If you add the inputs in the "yellow" boxes, the model can calcluate the rate you need to make the project viable.  

You can change the debt/equity ratios, targeted ROE, and whether the project is new greenfield development or expansion of existing assets.

Let me know if you have questions.

Click the link below to access the spreadsheet.  I also put a copy in the Asset Development file folder.

Hi Michelle - I found a copy of the imbalance confirmation sent by TW to
Mojave for 09/98. At that point your records agreed with Mojave's that the
ending imbalance was 19,040 due Mojave. It is a little blurry, but I can
send a copy to you, if you would like it.

Michelle:  Thanks for sending this to me so quickly.  I do have a couple more questions for you.

1.  What is the discount rate you will be using to calculate the NPV in your open season?

2.  Can an affiliate of a company also place a bid for up to the volume available to Needles?

3.  How does the right of first refusal work?

For example, when we spoke earlier I think you used an example of a $3.00 bid for 1 year getting equal value as a $.30 bid for 10 years (adjusted for NPV, of course) and the winning party got a ROFR. (Let's say the 1 year bid won).  At the end of the year, is the ROFR calculated on the $3.00 value the shipper holds the transport at or is it based on current market conditions.  Let's say the market value has collapsed and the market views this capacity as worth only $.28/Dth and the current shipper is willing to match that rate does that mean he can retain the capacity?  Then for what term, whatever the market bids that piece for or will there be a set time the (in years) that the  holder of the capacity will have to match regardless of what the bidder bids?

I hope this example makes sense.  If not, please give me a call to discuss at (303) 252-6224.


Thanks for your help.

project is known as the Red Rock Expansion.

            Transwestern is continuing to solicit bids from open season
respondents as well as all other interested parties.  Interested parties
should submit bids conforming to the criteria listed below.  The
deadline for bidding is Friday, April 20, 2001 at 5:00 p.m. CDT.

            If you have questions or need further information, please
contact Lorraine Lindberg at (713) 853-5403 or your marketing
representative.

                        capacity:
SoCal Needles, POI # 10487 (50,000 MMBtu)



Awarding Capacity

1.  Written offers must include material terms (rate, term, points,
quantity).  Shipper should indicate whether it will accept partial
volume in the event allocation is necessary.

2.  Shippers' binding bids must be accompanied by a valid Request for
Gas Transportation Service form.

3.  Shippers submitting bids containing terms or conditions unacceptable
to Transwestern shall not be accepted.

4.  If the total volume of all bids received by Transwestern exceeds the
capacity of the proposed expansion, Transwestern will award the capacity
based on the highest net present value bid (calculated consistent with
the net present value provisions of Transwestern's tariff).

5.  In the event of a tie, the capacity shall be awarded on a pro rata
basis.

6.  Transwestern reserves the right to reject any bid less than the
maximum tariff rate, or any bid that would cause the Red Rock Expansion
to be uneconomic.

All
Thank you very much for the great attendance and participation! Thanks, also, to all those who had to juggle this meeting with others.

Attached are the notes from the meeting for your review and comments. One of the recurring themes throughout the discussions seemed to be that we all need to do more upfront communication and work to make sure that scopes, estimates, and project intentions match. I think the meeting might have planted some seeds as to how we can work better and more efficiently together. All we need now is a little passion and comittment to help the seeds along.

 

Thanks again
Mike McCracken

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

Earl / Laura, if EOG agrees to pay for the EFM do we have the unit available, 
and could we install it by Friday?  I told them they would have to wire us 
the funds before we commited to spend anymore money.

Thanks, Bob

El Paso Pipeline Update - The US Dept. of Transportation approved reinstating 
gas service for El Paso's Line 1100 damaged in the recent explosion.  This 
brought 400 million cfd of capacity back on stream to the California border.  
The ruptured Line 1103 will not be repaired until further investigations have 
been completed.  The availability of Line 1100 capacity had the following 
basis impact:  Permian to California basis for October dropped from Monday by 
$1.30/MMBtu while November '00 - March '01 and April - October '01 narrowed 
by $0.43 and $0.37 respectively.  Also, TW shippers are no longer using El 
Paso Window Rock as a receipt point on our system.

Transport Options Program - Representatives from 7 companies comprising a 
majority of TW's larger shippers attended our workshop on this new tariff 
filing.  All attendees were given in advance of the meeting a draft copy of 
the proposed filing for their review and comment.  The TW Team (Jeff Fawcett 
and Susan Scott) did an outstanding job of preparing the material, answering 
questions, and anticipating shipper concerns related to this new service.  
The only serious objections raised  by the customers were concerns related 
to: (1) potential abuses by marketing affiliates and (2) hoarding of option 
capacity by any one shipper.  Among the  solutions proposed were restricting 
Enron affiliates  access to the program and limiting the volume of 
outstanding options any one shipper can hold.  At the end of the meeting, we 
asked for final comments to be submitted to TW by next week in anticipation 
of filing the tariff with the FERC in mid-September.

KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok 
for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also 
negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the 
capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental revenue.

EOG Resources - We are negotiating a new transport agreement with EOG for 
incremental volume they could bring into TW's West Texas lateral.  Initially, 
the volume was 4 - 5,000 MMBtu/d but now may be at least 15,000 MMBtu/d.  EOG 
is reviewing the proposed interconnect and operating agreement.  EOG has not 
typically held transport capacity on TW in the past.

September Pipe Outage - We are trying to accommodate west flowing shippers 
whose transport will be cut from September 6-10 due to DOT testing on 
Transwestern.  The plan is to facilitate the use of PG&E Market Center 
storage to supply west markets during the outage.  Volume may be as high as 
20 -50,000 MMBtu/d at an incremental rate for TW of $.05 -.08/MMBtu.

Lorna,
Thanks.  Yes, we had heard that PG&E was looking to site a "big one" near 
Vegas.  It is speculated that this project may well be an anchor for a Kern 
River expansion.

don't...

PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first 
Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 
45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to 
supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed 
supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction 
during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. 
"Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the 
country," said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. "Because 
of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally 
positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth." Including the Nevada 
project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or 
construction in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona.

Subject: Contract Options

As we discussed in staff meeting this morning, please provide me with a 
summary of any type of transport options imbedded in your assigned customer 
accounts' contracts (i.e., contract #, Shipper name, explanation of option, 
term of contract, term of option, how much advance notice to trigger the 
option, etc.).  I will incorporate these transport options into a capacity 
spreadsheet which will be forwarded to our group.

Please try to forward this information to me at your earliest convenience.  
Thanks.

I understand this Level  A is approved for work order generation.  This is the cost from FP for a recyle line and coolers at P-2 to handle NNG Gray flows to Station # 9.  The NNG Gray is a 200 mmcfd bidirectional interconnect with TW.  The min. to run P-2 is 125 mmcfd, the recycle would allow for those less than 100 mmcfd flow requirements from NNG.

James, can you give me a reality check on my numbers, the estimate is stored on N: under P-2 Coolers and recycle line.  Charge your time to the Marketing lump sum work order.   Thanks

Hi Lorraine,

Next week I'm heading west to meet with Mohave Electric Co-op and EWS West Desk regarding this project.  I know we've spoken about it before, but I was hoping to have some time with you this afternoon to get you up to speed on our progress and get your input on the attached presentation.  Could I come by at 3:00pm?  Please advise.


Thanks,
John

Subject: POGO interconnect Lea County New Mexico.

Christine:

POGO has requested a new interconnect with TW in Sec. 18, T22S, R32E of Lea 
County New Mexico.  There is a 4" on 24" existing tap at station # 612+14 
between Mile Post 11 & 12 south of WT-I, indentified by the local operations 
team.  The cost estimate below contains the usual and customary facility and 
equipment costs:  



 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
  Subtotal  $323,000 

 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total                       $423,000

These cost are identical to the EOG +/- 10% numbers from the E&C Team.  Once 
again, the turn around time is generally 90 days from work order generation 
to in-service reporting.  The equipment best case delivery is 45 days with 
about a 5 day turn around time in construction.  

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.  3-0667

Sempra - We sold a Nov - March FT contract to Sempra this week for 2,000 
MMBtu/d from EOT to Panhandle.  The contract is a one-part rate for 
$.07/MMBtu.

Red Cedar - We received the cash out payment of nearly $800,000 from Red 
Cedar this week effectively clearing their imbalance owed to TW.  In 
addition, they gave us verbal approval to begin scoping a new receivable 
point to deliver approximately 50,000 MMBtu/d to TW south of La Plata.  
Facility Planning is providing a cost estimate.

SouthWest Gas - has agreed to remove the new piece of pipe that bypasses the 
new meter constructed near Las Vegas.  They have also agreed to amend the FT 
contract begin date so TW can re-sell their capacity that they won't be able 
to utilize due to their construction delays.  We are waiting on a new 
contract begin date before we resell the space.

Transport Options Filing - The new tariff was filed with FERC on Tuesday Oct. 
17.  We anticipate most protests should be received no later than Nov. 6.  We 
also have several customers filing in support of the new tariff.

effective 11/01/2001-10/31/2003, 13,500 Needles and 14,000 Topock
effective 11/01/2002-10/31/2003, 21,500 Needles

The spreads are still pretty wide even through 2002 at 0.75; and here's an 
opportunity to capture it before it tightens.

After reviewing the list of issues to be addressed, it looks like we would want to keep an eye on this proceeding but I don't think we will need to take an active position. If you see anything that may directly impact the value of our capacity or access to our system through PG&E then let me know. Thanks.

Enron talking points....


Factors Leading to Higher Natural Gas Prices this Winter

? Demand for natural gas has increased mainly due to consumption in the power 
generation market and strength of the manufacturing sector in a booming 
economy.

? Natural gas production and drilling has fallen off since 1998 due to low 
prices that reached far below $2 per MMBtu.  In 2000, deliverability 
utilization will be over 95 percent.

? While drilling activity has risen sharply (as much as 50% from last year), 
the production from this increased drilling activity typically is not 
available for several months.  According to the AGA, supply production 
continues to run 16% below last year's levels.

? The past three winters have been "warmer than normal" winters in the 
Midwest and much of the United States and Canada, artificially masking the 
usual consumption of natural gas under "normal" weather situations. 

? Very warm weather during this summer has caused a significant demand 
increase for natural gas in the electricity generation sector thereby 
competing for gas storage injections in the marketplace and driving prices 
upward.

? U.S. storage inventory levels are lower than historical average levels from 
the past six years, according to the AGA.  The cost of storage inventory at 
this summer's strong prices could eliminate the price advantage traditionally 
experienced in the winter.

? Other heating fuels like propane and heating oil are also showing 
significantly higher prices and potentially lower stocks this winter than 
last.

TEAM- 
	Below is a project request spreadsheet developed by Facility Planning.  We will use this form in an attempt to better communicate and track ALL the various cost estimates and project requests originating from TW Marketing.  This form should at a minimum help to: 1) better track requests, 2) allocate planning and engineering resources and 3) better communicate needs and wants so more accurate cost figures can be generated.  This form is a preliminary step in a larger project that Eric Faucheaux is developing.  

For now, TW Marketing is required to submit this form to FP on any new project requests effective immediately.  If once a form is submitted and the project is later revised, then a revised form must be submitted.  This is a great tool that will not only help us, but will help all the groups that SUPPORT us and our marketing efforts. Thanks for your cooperation.

Subject: TW Options Pre-Filing Meetings With FERC Today


I think we had really good meetings today with both FERC rates & policy 
staff.  Jeff and the whole team did an excellent job of drawing them into the 
discussion.  By the end of both sessions I thought that they seemed genuinely 
interested in the proposal and anxious to see the filing.  Mike Coleman went 
so far as to suggest that to the extent we can make the case the this will be 
a tool in the generation siting process, we would be helping his group with 
Chairman Hoecker's directive for staff to develop concepts to respond to the 
SW power crunch.   

Attendees
Rates/Tariff Group Attendees (OMTR Rates West):  Mike Coleman, Bob 
Petrocelli, John Carlson
Policy Group Attendees:  Ed Murrell,  Laurel Hyde, Kim Bruno, Kathleen Dias & 
Demi Pulas 

Things They Liked
Service/Rate Structure.  They seemed to like the fact that the underlying 
agreement is an FT and fact that the transaction remained subject to current 
rate provisions.
Open bidding for shipper calls
We will only sell call options when we have available capacity
The underlying FT and the option amendment can be released to another shipper 
through capacity release 

Concerns that Need to Be Addressed in the Filing
Concentration of capacity/hoarding/affiliate issues.  Mike Coleman said that 
we need to address this issue head on in light of El Paso/CPUC cases.  They 
are worried that huge block of future capacity rights could be tied up by a 
single offering.  On the other hand, he said that perhaps we can use this 
filing as an opportunity to explain how our bidding on shipper calls adds 
improved transparency and protections.  One possible way to address this is 
to promise that the time frame for posting/bidding on shipper calls will 
depend on the size of the block.  (e.g. a 20 M/D package might involve a day 
bidding process, a 100 M/D block may involve a week posting).
Demonstrate that puts/calls don't undercut the release market.  Explain that 
release is used for day to day decisions, while we believe options will serve 
to help shippers with longer term strategic decision.
Be specific about any waivers of the part 284 regulations.
Work on the definition of the 4 options types.  They stumbled over some of 
the wording, like the use of phrase "recall" in the transporter call.


Detailed Notes
We had a surprisingly positive reception from Rates West.  This could be due 
in part to Mike Coleman's reputed continued interest on the electric side and 
his self-proclaimed corporate bent.  He did say that he understands the 
underlying business drivers for this program  and suggested that a flushed 
out narrative with the filing to explain these would help our efforts. He 
said that the timing on this type of offering is good now, as the Chairman is 
pressuring Staff to improve the marketplace (the California situation again).

Both groups suggested that we needed to lay out as much detail as possible in 
the filing, including examples of each type of options.  

As Mike delineated and we expected, the major issues that may cause 
discomfort are affiliate abuse and capacity hoarding (cornering the market 
under a long-term option) or speculative capacity holding.  To defend the 
service, we should lay out the impacts and explain why this offers an 
improvement over our present situation (discounted firm).  

Some Specific Questions from the Rates group included:
 How does this impact capacity release
 How does TW protect against hoarding
 Why aren't all options considered negotiated rates. 
 Are options tradable alone (without capacity)
 Would the availability of options change the volume of capacity held by ENA
 How are ROFRs affected
 
Some Specific Questions from the Policy group included:
 What are discriminating parameters/business decisions in allocating capacity
 How are competing offers allocated when in excess of available capacity
 How are options posted, bid on?  
 What are parameters of the options, specify range & degree of flexibility 
(explain whether strike dates are fixed) 
 What is the "trigger" or notice period for either a Call or Put; is it in 
the contract
 Is this a physical or financial product
 Does this verge into negotiated T&C territory?
 Is this like Koch's option proposal?  (No - Koch offers an option on price 
only)

A preliminary model has been developed based on the limited information Doug, Kevin, and I discussed yesterday.  A finished product won't be complete until such time as elevations are verified along the new pipeline route.  Topogaphical maps are required to complete this portion of the study.  Once this is completed and studies run, that product will be reviewed by the Planning team and System Optimization team.  Studies will be based on the results of the open season and the volumes anticipated by Marketing. Expansion facilities will be adjusted based on those results and finished porduct produced.

We have a procedure in place with Planning that any Level B estimates that are major expansion projects, such as this, require at least one month to complete, after we have a defined scope of work from Planning.

Kevin, we realize your goals, but for us to do a proper Level B with all of our due diligences, it won't be ready before Sept. 29th, at the earliest.  Especially if the hydraulics(which are part of the scope) aren't done until after Sept. 12th from Planning. Thanks, Norm

Kevin 
I'll need to fly the routes and assess the terrain conditions. I plan to do this on Sept 11&12 
Ron will need to run the hydraulics on the various options. 
We both then need to agree on the most favourable option and do the Level B estimate based on the preferred route and the required line sizes and compression requirements

I think the earliest we can have the Level B complete is Sept 21

Guys, we'll need to get the Level 'B' cost estimates put together as soon as possible in order to send out binding contracts to customers.  I can't comfortably send out binding contracts with transportation rates still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience what your timing is for the Level B.

Ron/Kevin 

Based on scaling the topo maps I have, the following are the lengths for each of the segments we discussed. 

Transwestern Mainline- 36" Loop 

Compressor Station #2 to El Paso Take Off Point - 33.6 miles or say  34 miles 

New Lateral- 30" or 36" 

A  Compressor Station #2 to Phoenix Storage Cavern  along I- 17 Highway route -  144 miles + 5% contingency  or say 151 miles


B El Paso Take Off Point to Phoenix Storage Cavern along El Paso Pipeline route - 120 miles + 5% contingency or say 126 miles

In summary, the New Lateral using the El Paso route is 25 miles shorter in what appears to be easier terrain, but will require the 34 mile extension on the Transwestern loop.


I will flly both routes on Sept 11 and examine any other options from the air. 
I will drive as much of the routes as I can on Sept 12 and evaluate on the ground the soil/rock conditions. 
After this asessement, we can zero in on the most cost effective option and route to pursue. 
Call me if you have any questions

This project, of all that have been proposed recently, probably has a better 
chance of success.  First, Mission Energy is already a huge player in the 
IPP/Cogen business in Kern County, and is regarded as fairly skilled at 
getting permits/authorizations through the system.  Their existing facilites 
on Texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of power.  Secondly, this 
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is 
easily accessible off the West Side Lateral of Kern/Mojave's system.  As 
such, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of 
Kern River's expansion.  Also, realize that Texaco has a substantial amount 
of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the 
Texaco - Mission Energy sales agreement, Mission probably has access to or 
call on this Texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge).

Kern would seem to be the "pipeline of choice" here... particularly, when you 
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion.  
Without the direct connection into Kern County, TW would have a difficult 
time competing.   Also, keep an eye out for El Paso moving forward with 
commercial plans for the California leg of All American Pipeline.  A large 
end-use plant like this could be the basis for an "En-Rate" type transport 
program on El Paso-All American, particularly if they get their allocation 
problems resolved at FERC.

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

I added an extra "Printable Page" button on the page so that the entire page can be printed out.
Michelle, please let me know if you still have problems to get to the TW Unsubscribed Capacity page. Sorry about the delay.

Thanks.

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

Please go to http://twdev.ets.enron.com our testing site to view the modified TW Unsubscribed Capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want. I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Thanks!

Subject: TableTalk Session with Stan Horton


At least once a month, Stan likes to meet informally with different parts of 
the organization to hear from employees about what's going on.  During these 
TableTalk sessions, Stan also shares the latest Enron information and answers 
employee questions.

Please plan to join Stan on Monday, November 6, 3:30-5:00p in EB-49C3 for a 
TableTalk Session with the TW Commercial Group group.  

Ahead of the meeting, Steve will get with a few of the TW Commercial Group 
employees to ask them to give Stan a short, informal update on what's 
happening in our group.  This will facilitate an open discussion with Stan. 

At the session, Stan will also field any questions you have.  If you prefer, 
you can pre-submit your questions for Stan to Gina Taylor.  

I hope you'll make plans to join Stan on November 6.  This is a great 
opportunity to "hear it from the top."

attached is the latest TW imbalance summary

the reason that the volumetric valuations are lower is because indexes are approximately 80 cents lower than they were at 8/31/01.

500203	Continental Follette			Panhandle Deliveries			Needs to be added to PHDEL template
500390	Sum WTG Delivery Pt 			Panhandle Deliveries			Already exists under PHDEL template

Lindy - Could you verify if POI #57096 is still valid for any reason?

Ramona - It appears that some of these points are available for displacement.  In the new system, Linda indicated that a separate group has been set up for any points you have identified as valid.  I will assume then that these should not be added to the paired template (ie, if a delivery point allows displacement, then they will only be added to the related basin delivery template.  Nominating this point as a receipt would depend on the displacement grouping defined in the new system for pools and interruptibles.).


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	TW Contract Template Clean-up

In cleaning up some template information, the following points were found to be on no templates. 

	1. Do they belong on a template?
	2. Is the template listed the correct one?

Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.

FYI--PG&E has withdrawn their Open Season application.  Mark and I will continue to monitor PG&E's filings for the Gas Accord II filing which many had expected would be filed by this point in time.  gh

Glen,

In case you have not seen this PG&E motion. PG&E is calling it quits on its
BACKBONE Open Season application.  It is clear that PG&E can not maintain
its plan roll out for this Open Season and therefore one of the primary
reasons to do this at all (keeping pace with Ruby and Sonoran Pipelines)has
been made impossible. Next, there was a growing consensus that market
participants required more information concerning backbone rates and
operational structure. These items would be included in the long awaited GAS
ACCORD II filing. PG&E has to file its GAS ACCORD II, then I would expect a
likely re application of an open season. NO definite word on when the G II
will be filed. Mark, IGS.

Steve, below is a partial answer to most of your questions.  Can we set a time for Wednesday afternoon 12/5 to talk?  thanks


Max Hourly Quantity:  we are reviewing capability to deliver the MHQ in a 16 hr block.  Doesn't appear to be any problem.  What will be the plant's complete hourly capability?

Contract Rate:  will be a negotiated rate (eliminates rate risk for Gila).  The rate design is currently one-part (no differentiation between reservation and commodity).  The rate does not include AGA / GRI surcharges or fuel.  It covers a minimal return on the project's capital cost plus the ongoing O&M.

Fuel Rate:  TW does not track and adjust for actual fuel percentages.  Fuel was settled with shippers in the 1996 rate case; the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.

Delivery Term:  as the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity, goes up to cover the return hurdles.

Services:  delivery pressure at the Panda / EPNG interconnect should be a minimum 750 #

Capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG will be 500,000 Dth/d.

Alternative rec/del combinations:  Our thought here was if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the Contract rate.  For instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant.  If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, then you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.  

Backhaul:  the 50,000/day would be a guarantee.

Daily imbalances, short notice start up/ shut down:  We have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage.  With this in mind, TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project (36" pipe and 750 - 900 # pressure) but this will depend on what other shippers are doing.  (what did we do for Southpoint / Griffith)?

Michelle
 I have checked the location of the Wizard#1 well. According to the legal description, the well is located approximately 6 miles north of WT-1.
 I have listened to Mike's phone message and he mentioned that the field is located near the existing TW/ Conoco Turkey Track interconnect, unfortunately our map does not show it. The  Turkey Track is located 13 .5 miles north of WT-1 or 6 miles north of the Wizard#1. If they are interested, we might have to build a new tap for them. Please let me know  if you want us to develop a scope/ costs for this project.

I have been speaking to Mike Bauschbach (915-686-7709) who is a consultant representing a producer located close to our West Texas lateral.  The field is called Wizard #1, Eddy County, 19 South 30 East Section 1.  There is a potential of 20,000/day.   I have giving them a Level A (30%) from a recent project as an estimate for economics.  Can you verify the location (north of WT-1)?  Is there an existing tap close by?  

This could be a terrific opportunity for incremental supply, past our compressor bottleneck.

Here's the calcs I used for purposes of evaluating proposals for July - Oct, 
EOT to PG&E (Mojave values should be similar):

Current basis

EPNG Permian    -$0.41
SoCal Border    +$0.12
 Gross Spread   +$0.53

Fuel 5%     -$0.18 NYMEX, $4.10 minus $.41 basis = $3.49/MMBtu
 SoCal Spread Net Fuel  +$0.35

Current market diff. SoCal v. PG&E -$0.20 (+/-) *variable according to market 
maker
Spread value (financial)   +$0.15

Physical v. financial diff.   -$0.03 (+/-)
Spread value (physical)   +$0.12

USGT called back and said they'd be willing to do th $0.12.  I told them we'd 
heard higher, maybe as high as something with a "two" in it.  She called back 
and said they could maybe get to a mid-teens number, but certainly not 20's.

Here is the estimate that I came up with for work still to be done by Enron
when EOG is done.  Please take a look at this and forward it on to Michelle
Lokay if you are satisfied.  Sorry I didn't get this to you earlier to
review together.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has agreed to go forward on a new interconnect 
with TW in Eddy County, NM.  The size of the new interconnect will be 40,000 
MMBtu/d.  EPFS has agreed to pay $165,000 towards the cost estimate of 
$280,000 as well as commit 12,500 MMBtu/d throughput for a period of 2 
years.  Facility Planning is opening a new work order and we have begun 
drafting the Interconnect Agreement and the OBA for the new point.  The point 
should be active in 60 - 90 days.

Arizona Public Service - has still not signed the Transport Request for the 
14,000 MMBtu/d April - October 2001 capacity.  The current spread is $0.375 - 
$0.40.  

Red Cedar - has finally decided on their transport volume under our new 5 
year agreement.  Contract documentation is being prepared.

Sempra - has again exercised their option under their Gallup contract for 
21,500 MMBtu/d Permian to California for 1 year starting 11/1/01. The 
contract rate is $0.30 plus fuel.

Texaco is moving up to 100,000 MMBtu/d from PG&E Topock to Mojave starting 
8/21 through 10/31/00.  TW collected an incremental $.025/MMBtu for this move 
or approximately $160,000.

El Paso Outage-
 Current reports are the Office of Pipeline Safety is demanding El Paso hydro 
test, X-ray and ultrasonic test all 330 miles of pipe that is currently out 
of service due to last weekend's explosion.  It appears the 1 Bcf/d capacity 
to California may be off-line for up to one month.  

Related Developments
  --SoCal released capacity on El Paso for October 2000 to Dynegy at a 
reservation charge of $1.00/MMBtu.
  --Volume on various TW interconnect points has picked up on the east end 
including the new NGPL Winkler point.
  --We are receiving incremental volume from El Paso at Window Rock and 
collecting a portion of the market premium. 

Transport Options - a working group meeting with customers has been scheduled 
for Thursday August 31.  The objective will be to get everyone comfortable 
and build a coalition of support behind our new Options Tariff filing.

Burlington Resources - We held a conference call with John Hinton, Marketing 
Director, regarding the current operation of the Val Verde plant.  Our data 
indicates with the exception of a few T-5 temperature limit days, TW has been 
able to accept over 98% of the gas nominated by the plant.  In addition, for 
the last 2 years, the plant has been delivering gas with CO2 in excess of our 
specs.  We agreed our latest amendment draft could use some stronger language 
in terms of TW's obligations beyond a "best efforts" basis.   John indicated 
a willingness to work together as they were trying to schedule a delivery of 
215,000 MMBtu to us for Hub delivery.   We agreed to talk again next week 
once the volume test was complete.

SoCal Windowing - a conference call was held with Mike Nelson, Rich Jolly, 
Steve January, Terry Galassini, Darrell Schoolcraft, Ray Smith, Gary Choquet, 
and David Roentsch regarding TW's pressures and delivery capability at SoCal 
Needles.  Analysis indicates we have 35 pounds of pressure drop from our 
Needles measurement station to the SoCal station across the river 
(approximately two miles).  SoCal maintains that if we can give them 830 psi 
at their station, they can take the full 750,000 MMBtu under the contract 
(this translates to 870 psi at TW's meter with our current situation).  Our 
problem has been if we lose volume out of San Juan or a unit on the West of 
Thoreau leg, then we lose line pack and then pressure at the border.  SoCal 
acknowledges they have a motor out of service at Needles but plan to have it 
back on line in October.  But they maintain this won't help resolve the 
situation.  Operations has agreed to look at a number of things including 
changing the type of meter at Needles, looking at some station valve 
replacement, and mechanical condition of stations 1 through 4.  Marketing 
agreed to estimate the revenue impact of the pressure drop and lower volume 
delivery to help justify any capital expenditures.

Subject:	Griffith Testing Prior to Plant Outage

We are now in the process of planning a total Griffith Plant Outage to fix
equipment deficiencies.
Most likely start of Outage is on Sunday Aug. 12.  (earliest Saturday)
Duration of Plant Outage is approximately 6 days.

We have been running very steady for the last couple of days.  However,
please be advised that prior to the outage, various operational tests are
being planned.  During this time, MW output will be variable and difficult
to schedule. May I request your indulgence as we work through this phase.

Tomorrow morning, the Startup Manager will produce a list of tests to be
run prior to the outage.
As the Test Plan is developed, I will keep everyone informed as much as
possible.

Mary Kay -- This is a provision that is favorable to both TW and shippers in 
the context of risk management of index deals.  If their rates were anything 
other than pure index - to- index, then they would have an unbalanced cash 
flow and could be upside down.  This is the only real way these deals can 
work, and the only way the parties could have expected to do the deals.

Subject: Re: revised language  

I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in 
the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that 
the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed 
to.   My concern with adding the language below is,  could it be argued that 
not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just 
stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different 
rate??

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail, the other lawyers wanted a few changes.  My sincerest apologies for the confusion.  Apparently you and I were actually working off an old version of FGT's letter, not the one they ultimately approved and used.  Since you are out of the office, I've taken the liberty of forwarding it to Carl without you reviewing it first, since I know we want to mail this out soon.  

Carl, Michelle advised me that EOL's lawyer had approved the previous version so I assume they will want to review this one as well.  Let me know if there are any concerns.

Thanks!

(1).  We can no longer accept Co2 levels higher than 2% from the Val Verde 
Plant at Bloomfield.  This gas goes 
directly into PNM's system, and we have no other gas to commingle the 
stream.  The alarm limits have been changed
to 2.0% HH. and 1.8% H.  If there C02 exceeds 2.0% Please call the plant and 
request they cut back.  Please log every
conversation due to quality and volumes.  Names and Times.
This complies with our quality limits in TW's Tarriff for the Blanco Hub.

(2).  On the Ignacio to Blanco piece of pipe, we have different language in 
the Tariff to take the higher Co2 as long as 
it blends before it gets to the Blanco Hub.

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.  

thanks

Agave Energy - Agave and another producer, Comanche Gathering, are both 
looking to bring new gas onto TW's system in the Panhandle area.  We are 
reviewing available taps to bring 5-10,000 MMBtu/d into the system.  

EOG Resources - The new EOG well began flowing 13,500 MMBtu/d on 11/15 into 
the West Texas lateral.

PG&E - PG&E indicated this week they will increase TW's deliverability by 25% 
from 300,000 to 400,000 MMBtu/d at Topock effective December 1.  This is a 
huge benefit as we look for ways to maximize revenue for 2001.  
Congratulations to all the field operations personnel who contributed to 
resolving our contamination issues with PG&E on a timely basis while building 
an atmosphere of trust and credibility.  All the work is paying off.

Market spreads between production basins and the California border shot up 
this week then contracted by Thursday as weather fears and storage shortages 
across the US pushed prices up and down.  We successfully negotiated the 
following record-setting deals on TW:

 PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/15 @ $0.90/MMBtu
 PG&E Trading - 30,000 MMBtu IT for 11/16 @ $.075/MMBtu
 Sempra             -  10,000 MMBtu LFT for December 1-31 @ $1.00/MMBtu

Transport Options - Our recent FERC filing is on the Commission's docket for 
next Tuesday November 21.  We expect the Commission to order a technical 
conference maybe before the end of the year.

NGPL - Producers behind Marathon's Indian Basin plant are trying to move 
additional volume to TW via the recently reactivated NGPL Winkler 
interconnect.  NGPL is evaluating cost options to add compression; this would 
also help us sell the point as a firm receipt point and extract more value.

Here is the suggested general format for soliciting bids from shippers by phone for the Red Rock expansion.  Drew and Mary Kay have discussed this and have given the go-ahead to start calling.

	- Bids will be accepted until 5:00, March 2
	- Guidelines for bids that meet the threshold for making our project economic are [describe the three "menu" alternatives -- $0.60 at 5 years, etc .]
	- Bids will be evaluated based on highest rate.
	- Shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have their bid capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary.
	- Bids should include:  1) service request and 2) offer letter stating material terms (rate, term, points, quantity).  Offer is binding.  It can include a regulatory "out" in case the FERC rejects our filing, but cannot be "subject to management approval."

The only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the Nov. open season in a timely fashion.  

Previously we discussed allocating tie bids pro rata.  While we believe this is acceptable, we would prefer to not announce the tiebreaker methodology so far in advance.  Shippers who inquire should simply be told that any ties will be broken using a nondiscriminatory method.

Please see me if you have any further questions.  (I have to leave about 9 for a doctor's appt. but hopefully will not be out too long.)

Upon further review of previous recommendations to install recycle and cooling at CS P-2 to provide greater turndown, it has been determined that the P-2 turbine has too much horsepower and has single stage wheeling that would not allow turndown less than its current minimum capacity of about 125 MMcfd.  Previous attempts by Operations to turndown the P-2 unit using the surge valve for recycle allowed approximately 100 MMcfd before reaching high discharge temperature, but high suction pressures were available from P-1 compression in a north flow scenario.

Volume analysis over the past year to date indicated volumes through P-3 of 100 MMcfd; thus, with 150 MMcfd proposed to be scheduled through the NNG Gray I/C, a balance of 50 MMcfd would have to flow south to P-2.  Throughput analyses were based upon needing to have P-2 turned down to a volume of at least 50 MMcfd.  Additionally, P-2 throughput analyses considered available pressures that would be available on NNG's KB line.  KB line pressures can be expected to get as low as 600 psig; therefore, pressure drop from the NNG Gray I/C to P-2 suction would yield P-2 suction pressures between 570 to 550 psig for low volumes of 50 to 80 MMcfd, respectively.  Required discharge pressures at these volumes would be 850 to 885 psig.  The P-2 single wheel stage will not handle a differential pressure of 270 to 335 psig.  P-2 is designed to handle differential pressures of 180-190 psig.

Re-wheeling the P-2 unit (3 stage) is not a viable option due to the operational flexibility that would be required to maintain Panhandle Lateral certificate capacity of 250 MMcfd.

Due to the pressure spreads that would be required to meet low flow demands, consideration was given to add additional reciprocating horsepower at P-2 to handle low flow demands without P-1 online.  50 MMcfd throughput at P-2 would require 1200 HP and 80 MMcfd would require 2100 HP at pressure differentials of 270 and 335 psig, respectively.  The cost of adding horsepower and piping modifications at P-2 is not a feasible option for accommodating NNG-Gray volumes.  Also new air emissions permitting and regulatory filing would be a greater concern compared to installing a new line as follows.

The most viable option would be to install a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, install approximately 1.75 miles of 16" from tap to P-3, and modify station yard piping for various control configurations.  The existing NNG-Gray measurement and control facilities would be relocated to the end of the new lateral and located inside P-3 plant boundaries.   This new tap, lateral and meter relocation option would provide the following benefits: 
1.	Receipt of 150-175 MMcfd
2.	Greater operational flexibility utilizing NNG/TW synergies
3.	Long-term operational reliability
4.	Greater horsepower utilization at single location
5.	Guarantee of receipt capacity from NNG regardless of low KB line pressure
6.	Possibility of free-flow capacity from NNG not requiring P-3 compression during winter times with NNG Pampa on-line, which could be possible at high or 	low flow conditions depending on TW pressures at Roswell (Sta. 9)
7.	Fractional increase of O&M expenses at P-3 compared to higher O&M expenses of adding horsepower at P-2

A level "A" cost estimate for installing a new tap on the KB Line closer to P-3, installing approximately 1.75 miles of 16" from tap to P-3, and modifying station yard piping for various control configurations would be $1,300,000.  Due to the complexity of configurations that P-3 is already capable of and introducing a new stream with various flow paths that may become possible, a field visit to the proposed construction sites would be recommended prior to submitting a Level "B" or "C" release.  See attached sketch for general route information proposed.

Moreover, the relocation of the NNG interconnect and installing the new lateral should create the opportunity for greater receipt volumes from NNG considering larger pipe and expanded I/C facilities because P-3 has plenty of available horsepower to utilize.  Actual conditions were provided by Operations from dates in the past where P-3 was actually compressing 370 MMcfd w/ units 3,4 & 5, Ps-599psig/Pd-874psig; also 265 MMcfd w/ units 2 & 5, Ps-540 psig/Pd-844 psig.  Depending on NNG conditions greater volumes than 150 MMcfd may be realized into TW having 250 MMcfd flowing south and additional volumes available to flow to Red Deer, Lefors and Cactus Laterals if needed.

I will be attending an offsite ETS Planning & Power Services department conference on Wednesday and Thursday.  Perhaps on Friday or early next week we should convene for further discussions via conference call with all interested parties call for direction of this proposal.  I will be checking my voice mail periodically for any comments and will call back during breaks if possible.  You may also send a text message to my pager at 8777270018@skytel.com.  EF 713/853-3395

The EOL Products for NNG are up and running.  We have now completed several TFX agreements on line; each contract taking only a few seconds from the Shipper's "click" to having an activated agreement ready for nomination.  Here's a brief summary on how EOL is setup for NNG Products and who you can contact for assistance.

Here is an update:

Red Cedar - still need Mary Kay's signature prior to my sending to Dan 
McCarty.  Mary Kay's secretary indicated yesterday that she will be back in 
the office today.  Base transportation contract is ready to go.

Sempra - reminded Drew Fossum 2nd time this morning to approve. I still do 
not have the request for the tranportation contract from Sempra for the Jan 
1, 2001 - Dec. 31, 2001 Ignacio to Blanco deal!  We need this immediately.  I 
already have Dan McCarty's approval.

Texaco - Same as for Sempra - reminded Drew again this morning we need 
approval.  Still do not have the request form for transportation contract! I 
already have Dan McCarty's approval.

Sempra - November 2000 - October 31, 2001 deal.   Jeff indicated Stephanie 
will be in the office next Tuesday, September 5th and will sign the deal.  
This deal has been outstanding to Sempra for over 30 days.

Oneok -  Tendered by Michelle this Wednesday.  No returned contract to date.

Subject: Long term Basis quotes

As part of our ongoing effort to analyze Rocky Mnt. opportunities, I've 
secured the following (mid-market) basis quotes from Sempra Trading:

Term  1-year  5-year  10-year

Cal. Brdr. + 0.280  + 0.250  + 0.240

Permian - 0.130  - 0.1175  - 0.110

San Juan - 0.335  - 0.245  - 0.220

Rockies * - 0.480  - 0.420  - 0.380

* Rockies quoted from NWPL at Opal.  CIG North typically trades $0.04 - 0.06 
back from these figures.

The Commission issued a draft order issuing Transwestern a certificate of public convenience and necessity in the above-referenced proceeding.  The Commission found that the Red Rock Expansion will allow TW to increase its capacity to meet future growth in demand and that the benefits of TW's proposal will outweigh any potential adverse effects, consistent with the Policy Statement and the NGA.  The Commission granted the abandonment authorization and issued the certificate subject to certain environmental conditions.  Thanks, Maria

Here is my first draft of a "paper the file" letter to BP Amoco.  I need you all to carefully review it for factual content and to make sure I got the tone right.  I'd love to be even harsher, but I've already implicitly accused them of bad faith, so I'll stop for now (sure felt good).  Thanks.  df

Capacity Marketing - TW sold 35,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Sempra Energy Trading at a negotiated rate of $0.50/MMBtu plus fuel for the two year period beginning January 1, 2004.  The path is from Blanco to SoCal Needles; contract value is $12.8MM.  In addition, Sempra waived its right to utilize its call option for 21,500 MMBtu/d of capacity at $0.30/MMBtu during this two-year period.

TW also sold 14,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Calpine for two years beginning Jan. 1, 2004 at a floating rate based on the difference between the California border and the San Juan Blanco indices.  The primary delivery point is Calpine's newly constructed power plant on the Topock lateral.  The floating price can currently be hedged to yield a gross margin of $0.80/MMBtu, with a contract value (net of fuel) of $6.1MM.

BP/Amoco was one of several interested parties last week as TW marketed the remaining large blocks of our East capacity.  BP has come back to TW with an offer, based on available space, of $0.02/MMBtu for demand plus a sharing mechanism for alternate deliveries west.  The proposed term is for 2001 April - October.  We are working with Facility Planning to determine the available space.

Gas Inventory - TW continued to experience high line pressure and pack out west this week.  This necessitated an additional sale of line pack gas of 15,000 MMBtu for a gross revenue of $277,500.

El Paso Natural Gas Co. - Bids were due Monday (2/12) for the 1.2 Bcf/d of west capacity on El Paso.  They marketed the space in 5 blocks of various capacities;  minimum bid was 100% of the max California reservation rate for a minimum term of 1 month.  Market intelligence indicates over 144 bids were submitted for max terms of 5 years.  El Paso indicated the award announcement will be made the week of 2/19.  El Paso Merchant will likely exercise their ROFR right and take the space at max rates for 5 years.

I understand that EOG transferred the funds yesterday, 8-13-01, for the
material for the EOG Pronghorn interconnect.  This memo is so that we are
all on the same page.

Re:  Building - I called Abbott Building Company yesterday and told them
that Enron is releasing the building to EOG.  I talked with Mike Abbott
about when they could deliver the building and he said, "We can deliver it
in the morning if you want."  So, I gave him the phone numbers for Dirk
Ellyson to get directions and further instructions.

Re:  Equipment for inside the building - I talked with Don Pitts yesterday,
as well as, Mel Mayes and Ernie De Los Santos.  I told Don we could deliver
the material to his office or to the site and he said they really weren't
ready for it quite yet.  Mel Mayes, who will be doing the wiring and
electrical work for EOGResources, agreed that he didn't want to have to work
around all the equipment laying in the building.  So, Ernie, of the CDC
group in Roswell, has agreed to deliver the equipment to the site when EOG
is ready for it, which should be sometime next week.

Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.

Subject:	Re: Pogo Interconnect

There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks

Subject:	Re: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the facilities asap.

Subject:	Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Have you guys heard anything about shippers wanting gas at this point?  Let me know.  Thanks, Kim.

I'm with you.  If we can't make money, why enter into an agreement?   The team at Canadian is under the impression that they are going to be asked to run the units long term.   Not sure where this is coming from.
I think there are probably better places to put the units.

Randy:  I'm waiting to hear who has requested us to run the units, but if history is repeating, it is Duke wanting us to run them for 2-3 days to move their gas during an NNG outage.  I believe that even at maximum rates, we do not cover our costs.  No one in TW Marketing has heard from a shipper yet.  If it has been over a year since the units were last run, we have the option of abandoning them at any time.  What do you think?  Steve

I understand that there has been a request to run two units at this location beginning Thursday.  Is this a long term commitment?  I've been told that the units will need some work at some point if we expect them to operate on a daily basis.

Subject:	Canadian River Units 1 & 3

Mike Flynn - Canadian Team:  These units are candidates for abandonment.  What day were each of these units last run?  If they have been idle for over one year we can abandon the units under automatic blanket authority.  If we run them, however, it postpones the abandonment-under-automatic-blanket-authority option by another year.  Please let me know ASAP.  Steve

Michelle,  Will you know as soon as the funds have been received?  The EOG
guys in the field are ready to make this happen and the pad is ready for the
building, so please let me know when you get the $. 
	Also, we did tell EOG in the meeting that they would need to have an
Enron inspector to ensure that the station was built to Enron specs.  We
also told them that they would needs some programming time from our
operating team members and Measurement Services in order for the station to
communicate with the SCADA in Houston, etc.   So, there should be some $
somewhere for these things to happen.  The station will also need to be
as-built, etc., and EOG would not know the required information for the
as-builts either.

I just spoke with Mark Kraus from EOG.  He has received the SAP
spreadsheet itemizing the materials and is reviewing the information
with the folks from his field.  When the review is complete, a wire
transfer of funds will be sent to Transwestern.  Because Mark had been
expecting another invoice with the revised amount, he now anticipates
this review to take several days.  Once the funds are received, the
equipment will then be shipped.

Mark mentioned that he thought they were installing all the equipment
themselves and would not need our services.  What additional charges
could there be?

Red Rock is moving along...I wish I could send you the internal pictures of all the construction, they are incredible.  I want to propose a trip to one of the Compressor Stations for all our Red Rock shippers!!!

Your two expansion contract charges are as follows:
#27641, transport rate of .38 plus 5% fuel
#27649, transport rate of .225 plus 5% fuel

The transport rate is combined reservation and commodity, inclusive of all applicable surcharges.  There are no additional charges like ACA, GRI, etc.  Your fuel is a fixed 5%, paid in-kind.

Hope this help!  Talk soon.

Hey team,

Attached, is the location of a Red Rock spreadsheet in our common file that I would like for each of you to update for the Red Rock expansion shippers.  Please fill in the missing blanks.  You will notice that the last column is for the current status.  This column is of particular interest and importance as we manage the final negotiations of each contract over the next two weeks.  Please update it for the last few conversations that you have had with the customer and summarize the gist of your conversation.  Steve will want to have a meeting with us every Friday (beginning this week) to review the status of each contract.  Also, the bottom of the spreadsheet is for the potential shippers we are talking to about the remaining 50,000/d.  Please complete this section also. 

You will find this spread sheet on our common directory at:  common on'gthou-du01' (S:)/Marketing/TW_NNG/TW Desk/Red Rock Expansion Project Status.  Please go in an update the spreadsheet for your activity.  Don't forget to save the document.  

Audrey, would you please book a time with Steve and our team on Friday to discuss the status of Red Rock. 

Thanks, Kim.

Transwestern is in agreement with extending your Firm transport from
Griffith to PG&E, with alternate delivery at Southwest Gas.  The term is
November for 15,000 at a rate of .05, all inclusive with zero fuel.
Regulatory needs a paragraph substitution (see below) and unfortunately
Contracts will issue a new number because of the changes.  Please submit
a new Service Request and I will approve.  Thanks.


Substitute:

"For the term of this amendment, if any quantities nominated by Shipper
hereunder cannot be scheduled because of an event of Force Majeure,
Transwestern shall further discount the rate applicable to such
quantities nominated but not scheduled to zero."

In place of:

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide an
additional discount to the Shipper for quantities that could not be
scheduled hereunder due to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably
determined by Transwestern, rendering the supplies unavailable.  The
additional discount will be an amount equal to any quantities made
unavailable multiplied by the Discounted Rate.

Darrell informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned o=
utage next week for two days.  We will talk with their commercial folks on =
Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop.  We anticipate that =
we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead=
 with their September business as usual.  We will also talk with the other =
SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down=
 the lateral while Burlington is down. =20

Thanks, Kim.  =20

The effect will be to the Burlington (low pressure) system only.   We can s=

Today Burlington is flowing approximately 130 mmcfd.  Limited to 800 mmcfd =

A conf. call has been set up for Monday morning 9:00 a.m. CST to discuss a =
force majeure situation on the #3 unit at the San Juan Compressor Station. =
 877-795-3687 pin 475577=20

Overview:  (for those uninvolved to date)
     In a walk through of the San Juan Station with the Team Thursday eveni=
ng 8/16 it was noted that severe settling issues on yard piping existed.  T=
he Team had been working with Engineering on developing an action plan to a=
ddress over the last several months.  Upon a visual inspection we requested=
 that the Team contact a local contractor and have the pipe cover (dirt) re=
moved immediately to allow the piping to relieve itself.  This would provid=
e the necessary time to follow up with Engineering and attain feedback on t=
he status of the project and implement remedies.  The Team had a contractor=
 on location the following Monday 8/20, and work removing the cover was com=
pleted this Monday 8/27.  However, the expected results were not achieved. =
 In other words the piping did not spring back to the degree that pipe stre=
ss concerns were eliminated.  We requested that a structural engineer be se=
nt to the site immediately to evaluate the integrity of the piping.  He was=
 on location Thursday morning (8/29).  In a phone conversation with Phil Di=
ckenson (Trigon structural engineer) he mentioned that his immediate concer=
n was how this much displacement could not induce high stresses.  However, =
no pipe coating cracks were visible so he wanted an opportunity to input th=
e data in a model and evaluate prior to making any recommendations.  He did=
 offer, that at a minimum, we stand a good chance of exceeding the .5 desig=
n factor, but without reviewing the data further he would not commit to a c=
onclusion.  We asked that he work through the evening, if required, to prov=
ide the necessary information with regards to the pipes integrity.   While =
waiting on Trigons report, we notified the Team and asked that they contact=
 Foutz & Bursham (local pipeline contractor) and get an evaluation from the=
m on the estimated down time it would require in a worst case scenario to m=
ake the repairs/replacements.  (4 to 5 days)  We then requested that the Ro=
swell CDC (Ernie DeLosSantos) determine the availability of approximately 1=
50" of X42 356 wall 10" pipe, 12 ea. Y42  365 wall 90's, and 1 ea. Y42 365 =
wall 45.  (all material is available at Redman Supply in Farmington) =20

Conclusion:   =20
     Mr. Dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us tha=
t we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels.  The stress levels cal=
culated by Dickinson were in excess of yield as follows:  1.09% of SMYS at =
the connection between the recycle/surge line and the discharge header, and=
 1.01% of SMYS at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10=
" recycle line.    His recommendation was that the piping be cut and re-wel=
ded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe=
 supports, not subject to subsidence, be provided.

     Conference calls with Engineering (Spalding, Eisenstein, Rance, Pebdan=
i, Minnoti ???) were set up to review the data with Mr. Dickenson and it wa=
s decided to have Greg McIlwain on location Monday in conjunction with Mike=
 McCracken to initiate the necessary repairs.  After much discussion with D=
ickenson with regards to the modeling performed, Engineering indicated that=
 the system is Operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early =
next week when repairs are made.  The repairs will be isolated to the #3 un=
it only so, the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days (48 hours).  Howe=
ver, furhter evaluation by McIlwain will confirm timelines. =20

If anyone has questions through the weekend prior to Mondays call, I can be=
 reached at 520-853-3253.

The Pre filing meeting was held and went favorable.  They did request for us to prepare the draft EA in order for the timing of the certificate to be issued by August 1st.  They also requested that this draft be submitted within 30 days of filing.  We committed that we would have this done.   Keith has been in contact with Larry and John to get this started.  We did get them to agree that processing of the application continue while this is being prepared.  This was the only real issue that arose related to the processing of the application and they did not indicate any concern with the data we have for the filing.  

In addition, they indicated that they "hoped we did not have any spillage of the Indicated Shipper issues related to the open season" similar to what they just filed in TW.   We indicated that we did not feel  there should be any protests.  I would like to get a copy of the "Open Season" posting to have available for any response if they do protest.  They also asked whether we would be filing the agreements when they are entered into.  It became apparent, that in order for them to expedite as related to California, we need to have contracts showing that a market in Calif or Arizona does desire the capacity.

  A question arose on what we were doing with the current units and whether they were old- we indicated they would be placed in salvage at the station, cut and capped.  We did request the ability to place each unit in service as they were completed and we didn't get any objection, in fact they referred to this being done on NBPL.  

As a high note, Bob Arveland, asked when TW became part of Enron----  we said since there was an Enron.  I guess this was news to him,  
Thanks to everyone on helping get this done, now we just need to finish the reports, get them filed and keep the protestors at bay.   

Mary Kay

Here is a revised version of the Red Rock agreement which includes changes suggested by Jeff.  If you've already sent the previous version to shippers, that is perfectly fine, as Jeff's changes should be noncontroversial.  We've just removed the reference to the service request as service requests will be submitted along with each shipper's bid rather than executed simultaneously with the agreement.  This new version more accurately reflects the contracting process for this expansion.

I would like to schedule a meeting for Tuesday, Oct. 17th at 9:00 in room 
4194 to discuss the current processes of TW's TCI capacity system and address 
any issues we may have with the functionality of the new capacity analysis 
system implemetation. It is my understanding that the new CAS system will 
replace TCI and the groups and points  that market services uses for 
allocations. 

Please let me know if you are unable to attend.

Thanks Ramona

I don't think we'll be interested in this expansion.
Question, what happens if you have more interest in the transport, then
the 150m/day, how do you allocate this transport?

Also, we have the TW contract. I am hving trouble structuring the gas
deal the way we want. I'll continue to get this finished, and then we
plan on signing the contract.

Transport Options - In response to our recent FERC filing, a technical 
conference has been scheduled in Washington D.C. for January 9, 2001.  

Fuel Hedge - With gas prices running at record highs, we hedged 5,000 MMBtu/d 
of fuel for calendar 2002 at $4.50, then unwound it the following day as the 
market dipped allowing us to book a small gain in excess of $100,000.  We 
expect prices to jump again next week with the oncoming cold snap and we'll 
likely reset the hedge at higher numbers.

PNM - TW's response to PNM's request for transport proposal went out this 
week.  They are paying max rates on an East to East contract and indicated to 
us they feel the rates are not currently supported by the market.; TW however 
disagrees.  Our response to them leaves the current rate structure in place 
but has two additional tiers of volumetric incentive pricing.  As their 
volume increases, their rates go down.  In addition, we added a seasonal IT 
rate to the proposal that helps them meet any swing gas demand requirements.

Albuquerque Lateral - ENA is meeting with IPP plant owners in the Albuquerque 
region who would like to see alternative sources of gas supply besides the 
local utility.  If the operators expand the plant from a peaking unit to a 
combined-cycle unit, there is potentially enough load to justify a new 
delivery lateral off TW's mainline.  Part of the deal structure may include a 
volume incentive rate as throughput increases in the lateral.  Next step for 
TW is to build a rate matrix under several different operating scenarios.  
Responses are due to ENA by Friday 12/15.

Black Mesa Project - We continue to evaluate the potential of converting the 
Black Mesa coal slurry line owned by Northern Border into gas service.  The 
big advantage for TW is it will increase our capacity to bring San Juan gas 
to the California border but there is also a positive environmental play for 
Black Mesa and coal slurry along with Mohave and coal pollution affecting the 
Grand Canyon.  This whole project is contingent on several factors, not the 
least of which is working with Mohave Generating Station majority owner AES 
(70%) to convert the plant to gas and working with the Navajo who could lose 
a large export market for their coal.  ENA has agreed to approach AES on this 
project in the near future once their negotiations on the Las Vegas power 
plant are complete.  Legal is checking the existing ROW to see if there are 
limitations on the pipe usage.  

Burlington Claim - We are assembling the volume and revenue impact figures of 
the November train derailment for submission to Burlington's claims 
adjusters.    This will be combined with the total operations costs.

Please attend a meeting on Tuesday, 1/30 from 1:00-2:30 in the EB4102/Oma696 
to discuss the development/implementation of the TW Dashboard.  We will give 
a presentation of the Marketing Dashboard and then have a brainstorming 
session on the possible types of information each of you need to manage your 
day-to-day business.  

We would like to make sure everyone is using the new Dashboard so please 
click here to access - http://nahou-wwrms02p.ets.enron.com/ .   Your ID and 
password are the same as your current LogonID (ex.llindber for Lorraine).    
Please click on the NNG tab and think about which of those categories as well 
as what additional type of information you would like on the TW tab.

We are expecting to kick off the requirements phase of your Pipeline Profile 
next month so we will also give you a quick presentation of the NNG Pipeline 
Profile that has been developed.

Please contact myself at x3-7275 or Bobby Mason at x3-5196 is you have any 
questions or if you are unable to attend.   

Thanks!   Martha

Yes, it does mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we can contract for on PNM--however, we have to use the capacity in accordance with our tariff and rates meaning if the PNM capacity is subject to recall (which I thought was the Commission's concern in the PNM order last year) then we can't use that capacity to sell firm service (not subject to recall) on our system.  I don't think we are relieved of our reporting requirements either that were required in the PNM order.  Maria--please comment if you think I have interpreted this incorrectly.

Does this mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we previously were limited to on PNM?

I'm very glad that this passed.  Thank you for your help!  Kim.

Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.

This e-mail is apparently in reference to the Lipscomb/Mocane Lateral outage. I think Darrell was going to touch base with you on this issue. I originally sent this to Steve, Gary and Darrell assuming they would run it up the pole.  But here is the e-mail sent to our e-mailbox.

Subject: Plant Shut In Western Oklahoma


In early June 2001, GPM/Duke Energy informed me of the planned shut in for
maintenance on your processing plant in western Oklahoma. The planned
maintenance was supposed to be for the period of 6/12/01 thru 6/29/01. On
6/28/01 I received notice that the shut in would continue until 7/9/01 due
to "waiting on parts/material"
On 7/8/01 I received a notice that the shut in would continue until 7/13/01
due to "waiting on parts/material". On 7/10/01 I recieved a notice that the
shut in would continue until 7/18/01 due to "waiting on parts/material".
When I checked as to the status of the project early the morning of 7/18/01,
I found that the shut in would continue until 7/27/01 due to " waiting on
parts/material".

When is the parts/material ever going to arrive?

Was this a planned shut in?

This has turned out to be very, very, costly to your customers. Are their
any plans for any compensation to them?

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective March 1, 2002 forward. 

A couple of things to note:
ENA's capacity on K #24924 was successfully released for March with TW collecting marketing revenues.
PG&E released a package of gas for 20,000/day from Bloomfield to CA at a fixed rate for the period 6/1/02 - 10/31/02.
PG&E also has another package of gas that will be posted next week.  Tentative terms of the deal are 20,000/day at a fixed rate for the period 6/1/02 - 10/31/02.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

 

Thanks,

Subject: 2001 Plan - Resubscription Assumptions

Please let me know your availability to meet for 1-2 hours either Wednesday 
or Friday afternoon to discuss the resubscription assumptions for the 
following blocks of capacity that become available in the year 2001.  It 
would be helpful to get some long-term and short-term quotes before our 
meeting (so maybe Friday is better) to discuss the future value of this 
space.  (Of course, contracts can extend past Dec-01, but these are the 
months we need for the plan.)  Let's discuss various combinations of these 
segments as well (for example:  Can we get more for IG to BL space if we 
ultimately combine to subscribe IG to WOT?)

EOT to WOT    20,000/d Feb-Dec
EOT to WOT    70,000/d Nov-Dec
EOT to WOT      8,000/d Apr-Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.13  to .15)

BL to TH    20,000/d Dec
(Currently subscribed at max)

EOT to EOT    10,000/d Mar-Dec
EOT to EOT    15,000/d Apr-Dec
EOT to EOT    25,000/d Oct-Dec (currently sold seasonally 40/25/10)
EOT to EOT  440,000/d Nov-Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.0075 to .11)

TH to EOT     20,000/d Dec
(Currently subscribed at max)

IG to BL     48,000/d Jan-Dec
IG to BL       4,000/d Feb-Dec
IG to BL     15,000/d Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.03 to .06)

S. IG to BL  158,500/d Jan-Dec
S. IG to BL    26,000/d Feb-Dec
(Currently subscribed at $.02 to .06)

Thanks!  Lindy

As a follow-up to our discussion when I was in Houston, attached is a memo that addresses how negotiated rate contracts will be treated in Transwestern's next rate case.  I had drafted the memo in response to numerous questions from BP regarding their Red Rock contract rate.  Pls. let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks, Maria

Michelle,

I wanted to know about connecting into the suction of WT-1 (Not sure I have
the name correct, but the station located off of HWY 180/62 Carlsbad/Hobbs
Highway).  We have a line we are evaluating converting to lean gathering.
It passes about 1 mile from this station.  Is it possible to connect there.
We will be looking for 19 MMCFD initially and then increasing to 30 if the
volume shows up.  We currently have about 13 MMCFD we would take into this
point.

Kevin,
After updating TWDP database to July 2000,  I noticed that there are 
contracts without deal makers information.
Would you please have someone update deal maker information for the following 
contracts.
Please let me know when it's done so I can rerun.

Fuel and variable amounts to roughly $.31. Therefore, our revised numbers should be $1.52 for April - October and $1.74 for April - January.

Sorry for the confusion!

I realize we never talked about how the bids were stated - ours was inclusive of fuel and all variable charges. This will make a big difference in the ultimate rate to your shipper. Do you need me to break this out?

Hey guys (or actually for our current group, girls),

Let's plan on getting together on Wednesday, Aug. 1 from 2:00 to 3:30 in EB4180.  The following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority.  To the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items, it will expedite our discussion (just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information) :

Price Spreads for ROFR contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy.
Imbalances on OBA's
Analysis of I to I spreads.  -  Review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads.  Would we have made more money?  Is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an I to I rate?
Update Map - coordinate with Darrell, Facility Planning and NNG.
West Texas Leg - discussion on our preparation for the Facility Planning/Marketing Strategy Meeting.
Arizona Strategy - including Sun Devil.
Pooling.
Analysis of our business sold and utilized.  FT, Alt. Points, IT and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points. (On this item, we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information)
Weekend on call schedule - update
Phones
Update - replacement for Jeff's position.
Frequency of our staff meeting.
Industry Conferences
Vacation Schedules


Also, please let me know of additional items that you would like to have discussed in our staff meeting.  I would be happy to include them.

Thanks, Kim.

Thanks Laura, Michelle is sending me a copy of the operating agreement that was signed August 2000. I'll get a copy to Earl when I receive it. By the way I'll be out of the office until August 6th. I can be reached by pager, cell phone or the best way is to call my office 505-260-4003. That will page me along with ringing my cell phone. Thanks again for everyone's help.

the July, 2000 date correct.  Please send me the final version that goes out 
for my records.

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail, the other lawyers wanted a few 
changes.  My sincerest apologies for the confusion.  Apparently you and I 
were actually working off an old version of FGT's letter, not the one they 
ultimately approved and used.  Since you are out of the office, I've taken 
the liberty of forwarding it to Carl without you reviewing it first, since I 
know we want to mail this out soon.  

Carl, Michelle advised me that EOL's lawyer had approved the previous version 
so I assume they will want to review this one as well.  Let me know if there 
are any concerns.

Thanks!

Michelle was asking me about this capacity today, so I thought I'd resend this info.  We have 33,000/d of unsubscribed capacity on the Ignacio to Blanco line from La Maquina to either EP/Blanco or to I/B Link.  The customers scheduling volumes from La Maquina in the last 6 months are: Vastar, BRT, WESCO, Texaco, Amoco, Southern Company & USGT.

Per Perry's message below, we do have 33,000/d we can subscribe south of La Plata "A" to Blanco.  The only receipt point with available capacity to go with this transmission capacity is WFS/La Maquina.  Shippers that have scheduled volumes at La Maquina in the last 6 months are:  Vastar, BRT, WESCO, Texaco, Amoco, Southern Company & USGT.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

There was a Burlington contract that I had in the tracker for 30 mmbtu/d from Ignacio to the I/B Link.  I have taken this 30 mmcf/d out of my files.  The line capacity south of La Plata A has been in the 700 mmcf/d.  Recent discussions have lead to a new lateral capacity revision to  705 mmcf/d, but the EBB posting was still using 700.  I have made the correction to the spreadsheets and the EBB to reflect the new increase in capacity.

In addition, the new available capacity on the EBB for the rest of 2001 is now 33 mmcf/d, south of La plata to Blanco Hub.   Call me with any questions.

Subject:	Capacity South of Ignacio

I would like to confirm the availability of 27,800/d of transmission capacity south of the La Plata "A" compressor.  It has been my understanding that the capacity of the facilities is 500,000/d through the La Plata "A" compressor south to Blanco and that the capacity of the facilities south of the La Plata "A" compressor is an additional 200,000/d south to Blanco, for a total of 700,000/d.

Northwest Pipeline holds 23,811/d of southflow capacity through the La Plata "A" compressor.  That is all of their southflow capacity.  So, TW has 476,000/d of capacity from La Plata "A" and the whole 200,000/d of southflow capacity south of La Plata "A" to sell.

I show that we have 476,000/d subscribed through the La Plata "A" compressor south.  I show that we have 172,200/d subscribed south of La Plata "A", leaving 27,800/d unsubscribed south of La Plata "A".  I understand that the capacity at the Red Cedar/Arkansas Loop receipt point is fully subscribed at 205,000/d (12,500/d Southern Utes, 125,000 Red Cedar, 13,500/d Texaco, 21,200/d BP Energy & 32,800/d NWPL), but the capacity that's reserved for NWPL at this interconnect is related to NWPL's northflow transmission capacity, so it should not be included in the southflow totals.

Therefore, I would like to confirm that there is 27,800/d of southflow capacity south of La Plata "A" that could be sold from a receipt point other than Arkansas Loop.  Basically, the transport would have to come from the WFS/La Maquina receipt point and deliver to either I/B Link or EP/Blanco.

Please let me know if you agree.  Ron, if you could assist, it would be greatly appreciated!

David,
Here is Legal's spin on the amendment...can you guys work with this?  Do
you know the upstream contract number?  Thanks.

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide a credit
to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due
to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern,
on Contract No. ___ (upstream contract) rendering the supplies
unavailable.  The amount of the credit will be calculated by multiplying

Monday.  Have a good weekend, I hope the dentist was kind!

Jo,

Vernon and I got together and came up with some suggestions on possible formats for the morning meeting.  Below are some of the ideas that we came up with:

As suggested before, we would like to break up the price reporting by giving each individual an area to report.  This could include cash, forward and operational information.  Also, that individual would report on what dynamics they expect to see in the forward market and the impact it would have on NNG.  These areas would be rotated every three months to help each individual learn the various regions.  Vernon, Jeff, John and myself could come up with the format and divide up the areas.  

Operations group could report maintenance on the surrounding pipelines that interconnect with NNG. They have alot of contact with the other pipelines and could provide valuable information to the group.  Also, once the pipeline scrapping project is developed further, would it make sense for this group to utilize and compile this information?

Could the TW reporting be expanded to include a marketing person in the meeting that could provide marketing and pricing information?  They could report on the West region and the dynamics that would effect both TW and NNG.

Capacity Release information could become part of the format as needed.  What is on the report that has changed?  How does this year compare to last year?  Was there a large package of capacity that was posted but never transacted?

Do we want to telescope the meeting?  Start out with all groups and then allow certain groups to leave after their presentations?

One individual could be responsible for reporting weather information.


Please let us know your feedback!

Thanks!
Theresa

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

following contracts:

CR #		Shipper				Effective		MDQ
27803		BP				1/1/03 - 12/31/04	25,000
27813		Sempra				2/1/02 - 2/28/02		15,000

Pipeline Operations - As of December, 1 TW is back to scheduling over 
1,054,000 MMBtu/d to the California border.  The preliminary indication on 
the corrosion dig-outs that occurred this week is the pipe appears to be OK 
but the final call will come from Max Brown's office shortly.  

Gas Inventory Sale - In preparation for the corrosion dig-outs this week, we 
assisted operations in relieving some line pressure by selling gas inventory 
at the Cal Border pool.  We sold 10,000 MMBtu for gas day 11/30 at 
$14.00/MMBtu.

Expired ROFR's - Two contract ROFR notifications expired this week 
(11/30/2000).  Both of these contracts will terminate next year 11/30/2001.  
Burlington has  15,000 MMBtu/d from  Ignacio to Blanco and PG&E has 20,000 
MMBtu/d from Blanco to EOT.  

Park N Ride - Eprime signed a 50,000 MMBtu/d park and ride agreement 
effective 12/01/2000.  Current posted rates are at max of .3883.
Invoices are going out next week.

I took a look at the two invoices and there should be no changes.  Because no gas flowed under these contracts for December, all that we could bill is the max reservation rate plus applicable surcharges (rather than the contracted daily rate of $0.2175 and $0.2200).

If you have any questions, please let me know.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Can we Gas Control make an assumption that no gas will flow until EFM is 
installed.  We need this info. to balance our system.

Subject: Re: EOG Pronghorn Location  

If we bare any expense, EOG is suppose to reimburse us, but getting money out 
of them is like pulling teeth.  

I suggest we complete the work at the site and have our facilities ready to 
proceed when necessary.  Marketing is not in a position right now to pay the 
cost of the EFM.  Given that these volumes will flow under a "pooling 
agreement", there isn't any incremental revenue generated for TW.

We will get with EOG to request payment for the EFM before we proceed.  Any 
idea how much the EFM will cost?

Subject:	Waiver of Price Cap on Capacity Release

FYI

I have been in several discussions lately where the statement has been made that waiver of the price cap on capacity release expires in September 2001.  This is incorrect.   Order 637 states that the Commission is waiving the maximum rate ceiling in its capacity release regulations until September 30, 2002 for short-term releases of capacity of less than one year beginning upon the effective date of this rule. 


(i) Waiver of maximum rate ceiling. Until September 30, 2002, the maximum rate ceiling does not apply to capacity release transactions of less than one year. With respect to releases of 31 days or less under paragraph (h), the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) will apply to all such releases regardless of the rate charged.

This email will serve as documentation for removing the Right of First Refusal indicator from Oneok's contract #27340.  The contract has gone through the ROFR process but was not awarded.  When this indicator is lifted, 20000 should appear on Transwestern's bulletin board...10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock.  Thanks.

Michelle,

Sorry for the delay in getting this to you.  The following is a partial list
of items that Williams would like to discuss in our meeting on Wednesday
November 14th at 9:30 a.m.  Other questions will probably surface as we move
through our discussion.

I would like to start with an overview of the OBA and why the change.  And
as we go through the new OBA these questions can be addressed as we get to
the appropriate section.  Does that work for you?  

1.  Methodology of clearing the ending imbalance as of November 30th. How
does WFS  pay back the "old" imbalance while also delivering volumes on the
"new" OBA?

2.  How will payback be scheduled when your line runs full all of the time? 

3.  We currently net all of the points in the San Juan area.  Will this
still be the case? 

4.  How do we handle situations that have occurred multiple times this week
where TRW has lost compression.  If this occurs after Intraday 2, how do we
makeup during the rest of the month if you cannot accept payback?

5.  When an under delivery occurs, who determines the responsible party and
how will the associated volume be excluded from penalty when caused by
Transwestern?

6.  What happens when Transwestern accepts Intraday 2 nom increases but
cannot accept the physical flow needed to rate out the day?

7.  How do you propose we track separate volumes / imbalances depending on
who caused the shortfall?

Please call if my questions need clarification.

Thanks

Craig, let's add the sentence below to the confirm.  My suggestion is to insert it after the Second sentence (after the words, "....listed below."):

Notwithstanding anything in this e-mail apparently to the contrary, this confirmation evidences a binding and enforceable agreement between you and [Northern Natural Gas Company/Transwestern Pipeline Company].

Met with the Team on Friday (713-01) to review the location and possible options for the Duke I/C at WT-1. The concern with the 4" restriction and the 30 mm they want to flow on Sept. 1, and if we would be able to take it. 

Calculated the pressure drop through the 4" valve with a worse case option of a 3" hole that was hot tapped (4" piping and valves is apx. 18" in length and rest of I/C is 8")  and the pressure drop at 30mm is 6 to 7 lbs. Duke has compression on this line and their pressure drop on the 8" lateral is in the 40 lbs. range to the inlet of WT-1. With the proposed tie-in to the discharge side of the station later, and no more pressure drop that has been calculated on the suction side, we should be able to handle the additional volumes with the current set up. 

There are several options that can take place and we can evaluate once Duke has installed their scrubber. 
1) The existing piping from Duke's I/C is manifolded  with a 4" to the inlet side of the scrubbers (current gas flow) and a 4" to the outlet side of the scrubbers (currently closed). Once Duke installs their scrubber and it work satisfactory, the Team can open the 4" on the outlet side of their scrubbers and have 2 (two) points for gas to flow on the  suction side of WT-1. 
2) If the proposed tie in to the discharge side develops, we can revisit another tie-in point for the suction side at that time and if Dukes scrubber performs satisfactory. With Dukes scrubber in place and in operation, it allows for open access to locations for a tie in, as most of the piping on the pre-scrubbers side at WT-1 is very congested. 

I would recommend that we leave I/C as is for now, if there are concerns or questions, please let me know. 

Thanks
Earl Chanley

EOG has been non responsive to our request for payment, (go figure).  I would suggest the team physically reduce the flow through the station to 10,000 mmbtu/d, in compliance with TW's operating parameters of requiring monitoring equipment for large volume stations, and continue to restrict the flow until the station complies with our standards.

I have also recently been informed by the TW commercial desk that they have decided to absorb the outstanding expenses to date, and will sponsor the cost for monitoring equipment and commercial power to assure the station complies with our requirements for volumes of this magnitude.  Could you reissue the latest W.O. and indicate that it is not reimbursable, but rather will be a marketing project?  This will clear your outstanding expenses and let us go forward with the station construction.

With regard to my other "favorite company" the team and planning are looking at a project to by-pass the 4" restriction in the WT-1 compressor yard downstream of the new Duke interconnect.  They will be tendering about 30,000 /d the first of September and wont to be sure we be able to take the gas.

Thanks for your help Earl!

What's the latest of the EOG side of this interconnect. They have tied in two more well behind the I/C and did not tell the Team. The Team pulled the plate the other day and it was covered with black b.s., maybe glycol and very hard to clean the plate. 
The location still has the temp. EFM on it (TW's) and no gas quality that was required. 

Is EOG going to pay for the equipment as they stated to get the  I/C in service then back out on?????????????
Is this I/C going to be Shut in??????????????????????????????
It is getting to the critical stage, we have equipment requisitions and some received and lots of $$$$$$$$$$ hanging out. 
What is the next step with EOG??????????????

I know this is your favorite company to deal with and figured you needed some news to cheer you up.

Please let us know how to proceed on this I/C and what Marketing would like to be the next step on this project.

Thanks
Earl C.

Effective August 16th, 2001, the ETS Deal Capture Team will help process all firm agreements on TW.  All requests for firm service should continue to go to Michelle or Dennis for the base agreement processing; however, the Marketer should complete and forward a deal sheet (attached) for completion of the discount amendment and for us to obtain the appropriate approvals.  Deal Capture will also tender the agreements and hand partially executed deals to Contracts for activation.  As time permits, we will reconstruct the TW Firmbook listing of all active agreements by production month.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks!

Craig

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

Capacity Marketing - We negotiated an extension of the 400,000 MMBtu/d east-to-east contract with Aquila / USGT this week plus improved the economics of their existing contract.  The extension, beginning November 2001, has a reservation rate of $.025/MMBtu with a 30% sharing of the Permian to Cal Border index spreads on all alternate westward flow.  As for their existing contract, we negotiated a $.15/MMBtu rate effective February 15 - October 31, 2001 on the alternate west flow, an improvement of $.11/MMBtu.  

In addition, we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with Astra Power LLC.  Their reservation rate is $.0325/MMBtu on a volume of 50,000/d for a term of March 2001 through March 2003.  

With the execution of these two deals plus the anticipated closing of the Public Service of New Mexico contract, this will effectively sell out the east end of the TW system through at least 2002.

San Juan Flow Conditioner - The decision was made this week to postpone till March the application of the Exxon/Nalco flow conditioner in the San Juan lateral.  Had we proceeded with the application in February (a tariff month), the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been $300,000.

SouthWest Gas - We received the fully executed OBA contract from SouthWest Gas this week.

Gas Inventory - With moderating temperatures out west reducing demand and shippers paying gas back to TW, we were experiencing high linepack for most of the week.  TW was able to sell 55,000 MMBtu at the border for a net revenue of $453,000.

Reliant - We negotiated a San Juan Pool contract for 20,000 MMBtu/d at max rates for February 6-28.  Reliant is flowing alternate out of path from San Juan to the border and scheduling 5,000 to 12,000 MMBtu/d.  Incremental revenue for this could range from $42,000 to $100,000 for the month.

In addition, it's my understanding that the border numbers are the take-away capacity at the border, not El Paso's delivery capacity.  EP is still down several 100 MMBtu/d due to lower line pressure restrictions mandated by Fed DOT after the New Mexico explosion.

Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please reconfirm with other sources.

Thanks for the update.  

I agree we should go ahead and prepare for the inevitable "I want to flow 
tomorrow" scenario.  Let's use the $35,000 to proceed with our internal 
administrative needs, including "land owner notification" and then we will be 
ready for them when they begin construction.

Let me know if there is anything I can do.

Bob

The material for the I/C is ready to ship to EOG. Do we go ahead and send the material or hold till they pay? The material is in the Roswell CDC and will remain there with the exception of the building, till we receive your response.

EC,  I got a call from Mike Abbott today and the building is ready to go.
Do you know if Michelle has an agreement made or any $ for this material.
Or, should we have this shipped to them on a "good faith" basis.
	In the previous attached memo, I told EOG that I would let them know
when the building is ready, so I owe them a call as soon as I find out how
Enron wants me to handle the material.  If you want me to call Michelle
directly, I can do that, too, just let me know.  Thanks and have a great

Michelle:  We have reviewed just the areas ofchange and have the following adjustment to make regarding the agreement between TW and SoCalGas.

Here's what we are thinking.

Paragraph 7 Right to Terminate

(c) delete this part--does not consummate the Transwestern-SoCal Agreement on or before March 31, 2002,

(c) insert this language--if Transwestern accepts a FERC Certificate that requires incremental shippers under the Red Rock expansion to subordinate their delivery rights at the SoCal Needles deliver point to other existing shippers...

I've been provided a bootleg copy of the results of the El Paso open season.  Here's the most interesting thing... El Paso waived its right of first refusal under the one year deal done last year, and participated with everyone else in the open season.  Accordingly, they were allocated capacity along with everyone else.  Remember, all these deals were [supposedly] done at EPNG's max rates.  There were approx. 30 successful bidders, and their bids were for various term lengths.  Here are the more significant awards:

Burlington-  7,000
CEG Energy Options-  37,800
Coral-  15,000
Duke-  212,000
Dynegy- 56,500
El Paso Merchant- 277,000
ENA-  254,000
MGI Supply (Pemex)- 38,000
Oxy-  19,000
PG&E (et al.)- 151,000
SMUD-  10,000
Sempra Trading-  6,500
SoCal- 19,000
Texaco-  58,500
Williams- 11,500

Here's the other EPNG news flash... apparently, EPNG is telling shippers to be on the lookout for an announcement next week of another open season to guage shippers interest in a major expansion of its system.  I'm assuming at this point this project will include the All American pipeline asset.

I'm also now told that the Kern River expansion may be much larger than what we were led to believe a couple of weeks ago.  We heard earlier that they were looking at doing a 500 MMcf/d expansion that would include the 124 MMcf/d expansion already sold.  New information suggests that the 500 MMcf/d expansion may be significantly understated, and volumes may approach 700 - 800 MMcf/d.  The expansion would include not only compression, but would involve additional pipe, and would not be rolled into existing rates, but would be an incrementally priced project.

Dave:

Attached is a proposal for Firm Transportation Services that provide economic 
incentives to encourage SPS to build a lateral from the nichols Plant in 
Potter CO, Tx to our Transwestern Panhandle lateral.

As we have discussed, the proposal allows flexibility for receipt and 
delivery, yet provides rate assurance.

Thanks for your help, and if you have any questions please give me or 
Michelle a call.

Sincerly,

Bob

If we bare any expense, EOG is suppose to reimburse us, but getting money out 
of them is like pulling teeth.  

I suggest we complete the work at the site and have our facilities ready to 
proceed when necessary.  Marketing is not in a position right now to pay the 
cost of the EFM.  Given that these volumes will flow under a "pooling 
agreement", there isn't any incremental revenue generated for TW.

We will get with EOG to request payment for the EFM before we proceed.  Any 
idea how much the EFM will cost?

PG&E Market Center - The first "true blue" California Market Center deal has 
been completed.  200,000 MMBtu/day was borrowed from PG&E in the month of 
September and sold to USGT as a Ride and Park deal at $.10/MMBtu/day.  TW has 
completed payback to PG&E as of September 19th.

Market Services Roundtable - Our monthly roundtable discussion with TW Market 
Services was held this week.   We gave a brief presentation on the proposed 
Transport Options tariff filing and its impact to the TW system.

Sempra Energy Trading - We attended Sempra's weather derivatives briefing 
chaired by their chief meteorologist Dan Guertin.  Dan's forecast for the 
winter of '00-01 seems to track with the CPC's.  Dan also believes that this 
will be an "oceanographic neutral" winter with no El Nino or La Nina 
influences.  He sees slightly above average temperatures for the western 
marketplace and a relatively "normal" winter pattern (30 yr. avg.) for the 
mid-continent (i.e. cooler than last winter).

As far as monthly variations, he is predicting a cooler than usual November - 
December, and a slightly warmer than usual pattern for the remainder of the 
heating season.  He has promised to make his presentation information 
available to the briefing attendees.  If we can secure a copy, we'll pass it 
on.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - The settlement letter to net out the 
imbalances between TW, NNG, and El Paso was drafted and sent to El Paso this 
week for their signature.  El Paso has indicated they will respond next week 
as most of their management is scrambling with the recent reorganization 
announcement.

Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant - Facility Planning indicates it will 
take another 1000 hp compressor costing $1.8 - 2.0 million in order for TW to 
be able to meet our contractual requirements year-round with Burlington in 
San Juan.  With this uneconomical prospect, we will try and negotiate a 
yearly average receipt capability versus a daily receipt capability.  
Burlington reported in Gas Daily this week that their overall production will 
be down for the third quarter due to "processing and treating efficiency 
problems associated with summer heat in the San Juan Basin and continued 
mechanical downtime."

Koch - An initial meeting was held with Koch Midstream Services Company 
regarding the Coyanosa plant currently connected to Transwestern's most 
southern area of the West Texas lateral.  Koch does not have equity gas of 
their own at this plant but has offered to provide us the names of companies 
who do process gas at the plant.   Tailgate gas from the Coyanosa plant is 
currently sold at the Waha index.  Koch's Coyanosa plant is one plant which 
would potentially provide additional supplies (150 MMcf/d total plant 
capacity) to Transwestern as part of the Gomez to Puckett tie-in project.

FYI.  As you are aware the EPA is requiring a T&E (threatened & endangered species) survey for the air permits at Stations 3 & 4.  Larry has received verbal confirmation that the survey will not hold up the issuance of the air permit.  See memo below for the status of the survey.  Donna

Ladies and Gentlemen,

The reason Larry contacted us for this work is because we have two people in
our office who are on the Navajo Nation's list of certified botanists (Phil
Hackney and Jon Alstad).  Both of them worked on the San Juan Lateral and
the Looping Project that was done in the early '90s in Arizona.  However,
preliminary indications are that the Navajos might still require us to get a
new permit to do the work, anyway.  We have left a message with the Navajo
Natural Heritage Program to determine whether we can circumvent their
"minimum of two weeks" turn around time of receiving a "project-specific,"
"site-specific" permit for conducting the surveys, if they are going to
require a new permit.  In the event that they are unwilling to expedite the
permit to us, it may be two weeks before we can mobilize. We are attempting
to convince them that because our botanists are on their list, we should
receive an expedited permit.  I will keep you posted on our progress.

Subject:  endangered species surveys station 3 and 4

I recently received a call from the EPA in San Francisco and was informed
that the agency will not issue the air permits for the turbines or allow
any pipe to be placed into the ground at stations 3 and 4 untill an
endangered species survey is completed at each facility.  In leau of this
new surprise and in an attempt to complete all permits and approvals in a
timely manner ahead of the construction, I have contacted ENSR a consulting
firm out of Ft. Collins,Colorado to do the survey for plants and animals at
each location.  Expect a call from them early next week.  I would think
that the survey time at each facility will only take approx. 3-4 hours and
they will be out of your hair.  Please extend every courtesy to them.

Subject:	FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Sold 15,000 MMBtu/d of stranded firm transportation to Burlington Resources from LaMaquina to Blanco for October at $0.05 plus fuel, which gives TW an incremental revenues of $24000 not already in plan.  This transaction was executed through EnronOnLine.
Because the Griffith power plant is not passing the PP&L facility's testing, PP&L executed a firm transport agreement from East of California to California.  The incremental firm of 20,000 MMBtu/d is from Griffith to PG&E Topock for October at $0.10 plus fuel, resulting in an additional $62,000 also not in the plan.

accounts' contracts (i.e., contract #, Shipper name, explanation of option, 
term of contract, term of option, how much advance notice to trigger the

Please try to forward this information to me at your earliest convenience.  
Thanks.

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three 
weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a 
couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good 
gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work 
order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  
Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, 
etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will 
operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still 
possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on 
the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded 
like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What 
will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I 
can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a 
chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut 
in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the 
station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and 
also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as 
things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Michelle,

Per our conversation BRTI and Transwestern agree to increase the MDQ  of transportation contract 27748 from 10,000 MMBtu per day to 33,000
MMBtu per day, effective 12/14/01 - 12/31/01.  The agreed to rate for the incremental transportation quantity of 23,000 MMBtu/day is $.055
per MMBtu plus fuel.  As agreed, BRTI will have alternate receipt points from Ignacio (500535) and La Plata (500533) as well as EPNG Blanco
as an alternate delivery point.

Thank you,

Julie

Sorry, Michelle.  I was hoping to get you at least some type of bid,  but Tenaska is very closely reviewing where our investment dollars are going  right now with everyone's credit being looked as so closely and with various  storage and other projects that are currently requiring investment  dollars.  With that review, it was decided by our management since we are  not as well established in California as other areas, it would be best not to  send in any  bid at this time.   If you have other opportunities,  please let me know.  I want to continue to build our presence on TW as the  situations allow.  Thanks for your help.

Susan,

Per our conversation today, Transwestern Pipeline and PG&E Trading can wait until after the upcoming holidays to discuss PG&E's right of first refusal on the 61,000 MMBtu per day that is currently posted. In fact, Section 13 (H) of Transwestern's FTS-1 rate schedule indicates that Transwestern could wait until July 31, 2002 to notify PG&E Trading as to the terms of the best offer. PG&E Trading would then have two weeks to notify Transwestern of its desire to match. I, however, suggest that we begin discussions of the outcome of the posting sometime in January.

I hope that your Holiday Season is everything you are hoping it will be. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Best Regards,

Paul

The attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with Drew about the 
marketing fee.  The FTS-1 Agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement 
(i.e., minus the marketing fee language) and the parties will execute the 
attached instead.  Questions or comments -- let me know.

Subject: Oneok Contract

Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate 
deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" 
section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 
30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.

Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account 
information.  My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual 
contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual 
here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval 
as soon as possible.

Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if 
possible.  Thank you.

Pursuant to our meeting, I was to check the posting timelines to see if we =
could make the 1 day category, include 5 months or less rather than less th=
an 5 months.  Based on a recent decision (March 16, 2001) in Columbia Gas T=
ransmission Co,  I think we can.  In Columbia, the Commission approved Colu=
mbia's proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm c=
apacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one=
 hour period from 7:00 am to 8:00 a.m.   Capacity offered for one year or m=
ore would be subject to an initial posting period of  5 days.     This indi=
cates movement by the Commission to much shorter posting periods for capaci=
ty available for less than one year.  I think we can modify our procedures =
to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category.  However, we may w=
ant to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 =
day category for capacity offered for less than one year.    In addition, f=
or capacity offered for one year or more, Columbia will advertise a propose=
d offer on its EBB one day prior to the five-day posting of the capacity.  =
(This supports a special posting in advance.)   Although it is good to have=
 these internal procedures, what is important to the Commission is that pip=
eline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of c=
apacity. =20

The Columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bi=
d for max rates.     Columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capa=
city to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months=
 until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auctio=
n package.  The Commission rejected this in favor of the Industrials' propo=
sal:  Beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service, Colum=
bia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than=
 12 months.  Beginning seven days before the capacity is available, Columbi=
a must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less th=
a 5 months.  Columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month=
 or less one day before gas flows. =20

Thanks, Maria

TW is currently in negotiations with a handful of shippers regarding 3 blocks 
of unsubscribed firm capacity:

Block One
Volume: 27,500 MMBtu/d
Term:  1 year, 01/01/02 thru 12/31/02
Receipt: San Juan, Ignacio or Blanco
Delivery: California Border-  not to exceed 13,500 MMBtu/d at Needles.
Price:  Floating.  Difference between NGI SoCal and IFERC, EPNG, San Juan
Award Criteria: Adjustment (+/-) to Floating price

Block Two
Volume: 49,000 MMBtu/d
Term:  1 year, 01/01/03 thru 12/31/03
Receipt: San Juan, Ignacio or Blanco
Delivery: California Border-  not to exceed 35,000 MMBtu/d at Needles.
Price:  Floating.  Difference between NGI SoCal and IFERC, EPNG, San Juan
Award Criteria: Adjustment (+/-) to Floating price

Block Three
Volume: 11,000 MMBtu/d
Term:  2 years, 01/01/02 thru 12/31/03
Receipt: San Juan, Ignacio or Blanco
Delivery: East of Thoreau 
Price:  Floating.  Difference between NGI SoCal and IFERC, EPNG, San Juan *
Award Criteria: Adjustment (+/-) to Floating price

*Mismatch between delivery point and pricing location is an attempt to 
capture more of the spread value.  However, early discussions with shippers 
indicates the structure may not be marketable.  We may ultimately revert to 
selling it on a "San Juan to EOT" basis.

Transwestern attempted to impose a deadline for consideration of these blocks 
on Friday, Jan. 5,  in order to bring closure.  However, some parties were 
not able to comply and will be providing proposals on Monday.  

If an acceptable offer for one or more of these blocks (Blocks One and Two, 
in particular) is received on Monday, then in addition to the preparation of 
the physical gas transportation contract, a hedging strategy to lock-in the 
spread value should be implemented.

I've spoken with Dave Neubauer and others (Larry, Morgan, Vernon and Theresa) 
regarding the execution of an appropriate risk management strategy.  In 
particular, I spoke with Morgan about hedging the basis risk by executing 
fixed/floating price swaps at the receipt and delivery ends.  We've already 
talked with the potential shippers about using NGI SoCal at the California 
Border and IFERC, EPNG, San Juan for receipts.  These indices appear to be 
the most liquid with respect to trading the paper.  They are also highly 
correlated to physical prices at the receipt and delivery locations off 
Transwestern.

If the physical transport deals are completed on Monday, I believe we should 
move to execute derivative instruments to hedge the basis spread.  
Indications from counterparties earlier in the week are showing about a $1.40 
spread in '02 and $0.90 in '03.   However, given the current state of the gas 
market, and after consulting with Steve Harris, I also believe we should 
leave the price risk open on the fuel collection under these contracts.  It 
seems imprudent at this point to lock-in fuel gas prices that are at 
historically high levels.

I've attempted to at least "tee-up" the requisite paperwork that will 
document the physical transaction, hedge transaction and attempted hedge 
strategy.  I've included it below for your use if a hedge is indeed put on 
for these pending transactions.  Please feel free to modify or to make such 
changes as you see necessary.

I'll be in Washington D.C. on Monday and Tuesday.  I'll have my cell phone 
with me and will be checking messages also.  Call if you have questions.

As I discussed with the commercial group, it is very difficult to post a minimum NPV because it depends not only on the term but on other assumptions in James' chart as well.  (Steve can shed some more light on this if you see him at Keyex).
So I've recommended that we discuss with individual shippers what there needs might be as far as term, then give them a number.  They were planning on calling shippers individually anyway to make them aware of the Needles space.
We can use our chart as a go-by so everyone gets treated the same.

We need to clear up the "minimum bid" issue and this posting would be a good place to do that.  Can we put in a new sentence setting out the minimum NPV bid?  We need to create a paper trail on this issue in order to be able to fully respond to BP.  We have been telling customers orally what the minimum dollar value per DTH is, right (i.e., the 15 yr $.36, 10 yr $.45 and 5 yr $.60 or whatever it was, right)?  MKM  do you agree?  DF

Please see the attached.  Additions to our current posting are highlighted; deletions are crossed out.
The purpose of the revisions is to announce the availability (potentially) of Needles space, set a deadline for bidding (in anticipation of a stampede for the Needles space), state that bids will be evaluated on highest NPV, and to specify a pro rata allocation method.  If you see any problems with this posting, please call me as soon as possible.

Christine, pls draft the IOS language for posting the 14,000/day capacity to 
Topock for the period April thru Oct 2001.  I would like the IOS on our Web 
page for Friday 8/4.  The IOS should include  Alt delivery rights to Needles 
and Citizens/Griffith when that point becomes active late next summer (when 
the power plant comes on line).  TW reserves the right to reject all bids (I 
think with the exception of max rate bids).  Please check with the Team and 
Susan Scott with any questions.

Bids will be taken between 10:00am - 2pm CST on Thurs. 8/10.

Please see Lorraine on any questions when drafting the posting or procedures 
(all documents are on the shared drive).

We will need to call shippers and possibly draft a message to be posted in 
Gas Daily for Monday 8/7.

I will be heading off on vacation later this week for the balance of the month.  I have forwarded the email document to my clients and suggested they contact Transwestern directly if they have any interest.  Thanks for your help.

Capacity Marketing - Gas control has determined based on current line pack, 
temperature, and flows, that TW could deliver another 10,000 MMBtu/d on a 
Daily Firm basis to the California Border.  This would put February 
seasonally adjusted capacity at 1,135,000 MMBtu/d.  Marketing has sold the 
extra capacity for  February 2 - 28 to Richardson Products based on daily 
index price differentials from Permian to Cal Border.

In addition, bids are due from prospective shippers on Friday February 2 for 
the 400,000 MMBtu/d block of east to east capacity with alternate rights to 
the California border.  The alternate west pricing is based on a sharing of 
the index differential.

TransColorado - TW has been informed by TransColorado (TC) that we have been 
approved to bid on the outsourcing proposal being requested by TC.  Bids are 
due February 16.

Enron OnLine - TW began marketing small blocks of east to east capacity 
packages on EOL effective February 1.

TK, this is the language that should be posted.

Transwestern is currently experiencing a high level of linepack.  Operators are reminded to stay within scheduled volumes.  If high linepack conditions continue, Transwestern may take further operational measures.

Subject: Prelimiinary Comments on Transport Option Program


Lorraine,

Below are some very preliminary regulatory issues that I have identified
regarding Transwestern's
Transport Option Program.  These concerns may not constitute all of our
concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal
with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with
management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that
Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before
the FERC.

Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it
to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed
description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with
Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to
Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address.

Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option
Program ("TOP").

1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP
service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current
FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of
market power.
2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service,
it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to
offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I
remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the
capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases
with a call or put pricing option.
3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party
(particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or
to exert market power by withholding capacity.
4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections
to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future
FT customers.
5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service
should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not
considered a "non-conforming" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put
options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be
specifically defined.
6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is
offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a
manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly
an affiliate).
7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based
rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes.
8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal,
perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed
as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow
parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and
others) file for similar authority.

Thanks again.

Lorraine:
I ran a test case for the BP 100,000 Dth from WTX Pool to Oasis for the term 3/01/01 to 2/28/02.  Below are the findings:

 -- Point capacities for Oasis, Valero and Delhi Ward are okay for the term.

 -- The 24" lateral supplying these 3 points is slighly over the path capacity of 350,000 mcfd vs the FT of 366,000 Dth, for the remainder of 2001.  Lateral capacity opens a little the first of 2002.

 --  Btu content of the gas is 1050

 --  Need 348,000 mcf of 1050 btu gas to get 366,000 Dth through the lateral to the delivery points.

 --  Risk -- If there is a call for all the gas at these delivery points (USGT @ 95,000 Dth, Astra @ 40,000, BP @ 100,000 & Misc. @ 131,000) then  we are at the maximium flow.  Any facilities problems or summer temperature extremes and we might not operationally make the delivery volumes.

My recommendation would be to only allow 90,000 Dth from BP.  Historically USGT has not utilized their full 95,000 Dth.  Do we want to take the risk and allow BP the full 100,000 Dth.

Darrell, I need some help with this one.  Give me a call.

I made the changes you asked for, plus a minor wording change in section 1 
about effective date.

This needs to be executed in duplicate originals, so print two.

If you have any questions, let me know!

Open season responses are due from shippers on Friday 11/17.  Please make 
sure you canvass all your customers to find out who plans to respond and who 
doesn't.  I would like to submit to Steve a list of who we expect to see 
responses from, their anticipated volume, term, and price they're willing to 
pay.
thanks

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.  

thanks

Audrey,

Since the project is in full swing and things are moving fast, it would be good to have someone who has been involved with the project to attend and address any issues Steve's area may have.  I will ask Andy Brady, the IT project leader,  if he can recommend someone that has been working closely with the project.

Thanks, LV

I've taken the oars at trying to revise this list.  Please look over and make 
changes as appropriate.  I've double struck the ones I thought we should 
delete, and have shaded in blue those cells which need to be corrected or 
filled-in.  Please let Kevin know when you've had a chance to review, correct 
and approve.  He can then pass it on to Audrey for final.

I've saved it in the common drive so everyone has a chance to work on it.  
It's at the following address:

Jeff,

Here is some information regarding the supply flexibility/liquidity/quantity on the East end of the pipe.  These volumes are representative of what can, and usually does flow, but given constraints and contract priorities, the volumes do fluctuate.  This list does not include the supply available from interconnects.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Bob

Transport Options - FERC has issued a draft order suspending our proposed 
Transport Options tariff sheets until May 1, 2001 and accepting them subject 
to the outcome of a technical conference.  The technical conference is to 
take place within 120 days of the order and will address issues raised in 
protests.

CIG Tumbleweed - We are working with firm shippers on CIG who produce gas out 
of the Raton Basin and sell it into El Paso, NNG, and SPS/Nichols.  With 
current basis spreads going to California, the market may motivate the 
producers to move some primary firm transport gas onto the TW system.  

Burlington Resources - Burlington indicated this week they have signed the 
amended Val Verde interconnect and operating agreement and returned it to TW.

West Texas Gas - We executed an east to east deal with this co-op for 
$.065/MMBtu on volume of approximately 1500 MMBtu/d.

Allocation Extension - Capacity west on TW will be constrained an extra 3 
days till November 30.  The re-grout at station 4 was delayed by several days 
as extreme cold temperatures prevented the new grout from drying; they are 
also having difficulty getting the unit aligned.  Also, the piston rods on a 
unit at station 2 are being pulled and sent to Odessa, Texas for rebuild.

I spoke with Perry Frazier this afternoon.  I have a copy in my file of the unsubscribed capacity on our EBB prior to the sale of TW space to Mavrix and a copy of the sheet post-Mavrix [ yes the space was posted ] .  Perry is printing the capacity sheets daily (sometimes).  

As a backup, Michelle Lokay will also do a daily print for years 2001,2002, and 2003.  The pages will be kept in a log book on the TW marketing desk for future reference.

Let me know if you have questions.

thanks

Take a look at the California send out numbers for 11/15 and 11/16.  We're 
really pushing the envelope here.  Collectively, SoCal and PG&E are having to 
withdraw over 2 Bcf/d in order to meet demand.  This situation is precisely 
what we've predicted would happen in a gas short marketplace.  Look for this 
shortage to be exacerbated in the next few years with the addition of the new 
EOC power plants, particularly, when the power is most likely going to be 
used to serve native markets, not the Cal. ISO/PX with its "price cap" 
feature.

Below is a summary of available future capacity to the California border:

effective 11/01/2001-10/31/2003, 13,500 Needles and 14,000 Topock
effective 11/01/2002-10/31/2003, 21,500 Needles
effective 04/01/2002-10/31/2002, 14,000 Topock
effective 04/01/2003-10/31/2003, 14,000 Topock 

The spreads are still pretty wide even through 2002 at 0.75; and here's an 
opportunity to capture it before it tightens.

Kim,

Here's the November Park and Ride activity with it's associated rates and 
revenues.  You might find some opportunities here to use the TW Deal Analysis 
tool.  Maybe its Morgan or TK Lohmann who could use this tool to set P&R 
rates to ensure we cover the varialble O&M costs.  As you can see there's not 
much revenue associated with P&R during the course of the month so the impact 
on linepack and fuel use has the potential to exceed the benefits.

Thanks........Terry

Omaha Facility Planning has developed a hydraulic flow model for NGPL's pipe 
system based on Ferc Form 567 data and other publicly available info.  They 
are also working on one for ANR.  The purpose was so Marketing could 
anticipate the competitive threat as they looked at supply proposals for new 
power plants.  Now that we know the tool exists, we may want a model built 
for El Paso's system sometime in the near future.  Let me know if you feel 
it's worth pursuing and I'll get hold of Terry Galassini.

In response to a concern Stan brought up yesterday, here is a revised version of the Red Rock form agreement.  It includes the following language:

If the Rate is invalidated by a) the FERC's modification of the rules, regulations or policy applicable to Transwestern's negotiated rate authority under the Alternative Rates Policy Statement or b) any order, legislation, or other action by a governmental authority, the transportation rate hereunder shall be the maximum rate set forth in Transwestern's tariff, effective on the date such FERC order or other governmental action is final, except that if the currently effective maximum rate at the time of such invalidation is lower than the Rate, this Agreement and the FTS-1 Agreement shall be terminable at Transwestern's option, as of the date such FERC order or other governmental action is final.

The language appears in redlining in the attachment.  This is to provide a starting point for negotiations.  

 
Jeff, Steve asked me to draft slightly different language for the Calpine deal you've been working on; see the attachment below.

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project

The project's consultant, George Briden, of Snake Hill Energy, called me 
today to say that Caithness Corp. has decided to move forward with plans for 
the Big Sandy, LLC. Project.  To refresh your memory, the project is a 
proposed IPP to be located about 40 miles south of TW's pipeline along 
Highway 93, about 2 miles outside of Wickieup, Arizona.  I've attached a 
simple bitmap below (click on it and hit "view") indicating the location of 
the project relative to Transwestern's facilities.  Ultimately, the project 
would be built for approx. 1,000 MW of generation in two phases.  Phase 1 
will burn approx. 80,000 Dth/d, and phase 2 will burn an additional 120,000 
Dth/d.  Initial indications are for the project to be in service in early 
2002, with the lateral pipeline and gas service required as early as Q2, 2001.

Caithness Corp., based in New York, is a privately held company with diverse 
interests including geothermal (renewable) electric generation facilities 
(Coso Plant) in California.  George reported that Caithness would like for 
Transwestern to build, own and operate the plant with facility costs (current 
estimate, $20.3MM) to be amortized vis-a-vis a throughput/rate commitment.  
Caithness would also like the project to be interconnected to El Paso's 
system and the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline if that project should ever 
be completed.

Obviously, we'll have to wade throught the legal/regulatory issues 
surrounding this deal structure, as well as the requisite credit assurances.  
With respect to the former, I think if we view this pipeline 
ownership/operation structure more as a financing mechanism with associated 
operating agreements, then we're probably OK.  With respect to the later, 
George assured me that Caithness can/will set-up a funding mechanism that 
would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback.

George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to 
meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10.  He suggested either 
Omaha or Houston for the meeting, inasmuch as he'd like Drew Fossum to be 
present.

Drew, I'm thinking it might be easier/better to have the meeting here in 
Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the 
lateral pipeline.  If you concur, what day(s) do you have open that week and 
is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill's plane for either one or both 
legs of the trip down here?  I'll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two 
others to join us so we can cover a fairly broad base of functions in one 
sitting.

Will you get back with me as soon as you can?  Others on the distribution, if 
you can sit tight we'll get you more information as this meeting date/time 
comes together.  Thanks.

FERC EXTENDS INVESTIGATION OF NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PG&E GAS T=
RANSMISSION NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS, LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULA=
TION

09/27/2001=20
Foster Natural Gas Report=20
Page 7=20
(c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc.=20
FERC issued an order in mid-month September that set for hearing certain co=
nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe=
en PG&E Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation (RP99-518) and various ship=
pers. The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t=
ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple=
s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates.=20
The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among=
 other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity ava=
ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why=
 its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat=
e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat=
ed rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu=
rther explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its =
tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati=
on of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity=
 on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it c=
an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti=
me.=20
Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier=20
FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently=
 arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject =
of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Trans=
western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transa=
ctions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject=
 to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued =
data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 orde=
r, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr=
ansactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the =
negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would n=
ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp=
ers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactio=
ns, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short =
time.=20
In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore=
 Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market=
 price differentials between the California border and producing basins in =
New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading=
 Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant=
 Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $2=
7/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excl=
uding surcharges and fuel.=20
In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc=
rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu=
ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: "Did Trans=
western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und=
er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate=
d rate charges at substantially higher rates?" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10=
.)=20
Background=20
Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to =
its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-=
1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Relian=
t Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Ens=
erco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Ener=
gy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and sus=
pended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01,=
 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates ti=
ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip=
eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric=
 Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or=
egon-California border.=20
According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w=
ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum=
 FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of =
surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at =
the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. =
The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu=
estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit=
y may be available on the GTN system.=20
GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew =
service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t=
o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.=
 Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on =
the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations=
.=20
Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:=
=20
- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity=
 arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem=
pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. =
Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to=
 pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re=
verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c=
apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t=
hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that =
the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th=
e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate=
, or the Southern California border market.=20
- Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco=
urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested=
 it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind=
ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the =
cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believe=
d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it "a prici=
ng opportunity."=20
- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t=
he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volu=
me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a=
nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M=
MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20
- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 o=
rder.=20
- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t=
han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim=
e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi=
rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi=
eld to Malin.=20
- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe=
rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo=
sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r=
efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta=
ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i=
t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate=
.=20
FERC Has Serious Concerns=20
According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions und=
er investigation "present several serious concerns." Even with the addition=
al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man=
y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he=
aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran=
sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann=
er consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t=
he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity =
that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t=
o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp=
ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa=
ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in=
 the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima=
ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains=
t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als=
o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20
Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's =
posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca=
pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak=
e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap=
acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is=
 awarded.=20
Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other =
negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities avail=
able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Se=
mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0=
00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec=
ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th=
e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com=
mission surmises.

Thanks again for your help on getting the well connected ASAP.  For the
weekend, we estimate we will be flowing around 34,000 mmbtu/day.
We have been replacing wellhead equipment and dehy's to allow for greater
production.
Hopefully this flow will continue for awhile.
We are selling the production at the interconnect, hopefully TW is getting
a good transport rate.  Earlier today, i could have paid TW $4.00/mmbtu
transport, got any FT?  $10.50 at the border, $5.50 at TW. Makes your FT
west shippers rich.

I know we have had numerous discussions with gas control, Michelle, field
people, etc.  Tell everyone thanks for the hard work.

Michelle,

	Here's the Burlington OBA with one change. I added an extra sentence to paragraph 6 that clarifies that imbalances in excess of the 10% tolerance will be resolved through cash out within 30 days of the month in which the imbalance occurs.

More info on Allegheny.  Apparently, they're taking funds derived from the=
=20
forced
divestiture of their utility based generating assets and using them to=20
purchase
new IPP plants.  Allegheny (as reported recently) is looking at building a=
=20
plant in the
Palo Verde area. =20


Allegheny buys Enron plants
Allegheny Energy Supply, the unregulated
generation unit of Maryland-based Allegheny
Energy, showed further proof this week of its
aspirations to become a nationwide wholesale
power provider, buying gas-fired plants from
Enron that serve three regions.
Financial terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed, but Allegheny will take possession of
three peaking units developed by Enron North
America: the 546-MW Gleason plant in Gleason,
Tenn.; the 508-MW Wheatland plant in
Wheatland, Ind.; and the 656-MW Lincoln Energy
Center in Manhattan, Ill.
Allegheny has been building and buying
facilities in Pennsylvania but last month gave the
first signal of its broader aspirations, announcing
plans to build a 1,080-MW unit in Arizona.
The three plants being acquired from Enron
all were developed after the 1998 price spikes
in Midwest markets, which highlighted the lack
of flexible generation in the area. All three entered
commercial operation in June 2000.
Don Feenstra, vice president of new
projects at Allegheny Energy Supply, said the
acquisitions fit with the company=01,s broader goal
of doubling the original size of its generation fleet
(about 8,200 MW) in five years. The three Enron
plants total 1,710 MW, swelling Allegheny=01,s portfolio
to more than 12,000 MW. Once the first goal
is reached, Allegheny wants to increase its generation
holdings by another 50% in a second five-year
period.  Feenstra said the Enron plants all can be
converted to combined-cycle for use over ex-tended

To All:
I was very optimistic in my target of getting the Level B estimate ready by Sept 21.
Based on the amount of work that will need to be done to get a decent +/- 10% estimate, I agree with Norm's assessment and therefore the best we can hope for is a Sept 29/01 completion.
We will endeavor to do our best.
Thank You

A preliminary model has been developed based on the limited information Doug, Kevin, and I discussed yesterday.  A finished product won't be complete until such time as elevations are verified along the new pipeline route.  Topogaphical maps are required to complete this portion of the study.  Once this is completed and studies run, that product will be reviewed by the Planning team and System Optimization team.  Studies will be based on the results of the open season and the volumes anticipated by Marketing. Expansion facilities will be adjusted based on those results and finished porduct produced.

We have a procedure in place with Planning that any Level B estimates that are major expansion projects, such as this, require at least one month to complete, after we have a defined scope of work from Planning.

Kevin, we realize your goals, but for us to do a proper Level B with all of our due diligences, it won't be ready before Sept. 29th, at the earliest.  Especially if the hydraulics(which are part of the scope) aren't done until after Sept. 12th from Planning. Thanks, Norm

Kevin 
I'll need to fly the routes and assess the terrain conditions. I plan to do this on Sept 11&12 
Ron will need to run the hydraulics on the various options. 
We both then need to agree on the most favourable option and do the Level B estimate based on the preferred route and the required line sizes and compression requirements

I think the earliest we can have the Level B complete is Sept 21

Guys, we'll need to get the Level 'B' cost estimates put together as soon as possible in order to send out binding contracts to customers.  I can't comfortably send out binding contracts with transportation rates still dependent upon a deeper project cost analysis.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience what your timing is for the Level B.

thanks

Ron/Kevin 

Based on scaling the topo maps I have, the following are the lengths for each of the segments we discussed. 

Transwestern Mainline- 36" Loop 

Compressor Station #2 to El Paso Take Off Point - 33.6 miles or say  34 miles 

New Lateral- 30" or 36" 

A  Compressor Station #2 to Phoenix Storage Cavern  along I- 17 Highway route -  144 miles + 5% contingency  or say 151 miles


B El Paso Take Off Point to Phoenix Storage Cavern along El Paso Pipeline route - 120 miles + 5% contingency or say 126 miles

In summary, the New Lateral using the El Paso route is 25 miles shorter in what appears to be easier terrain, but will require the 34 mile extension on the Transwestern loop.


I will flly both routes on Sept 11 and examine any other options from the air. 
I will drive as much of the routes as I can on Sept 12 and evaluate on the ground the soil/rock conditions. 
After this asessement, we can zero in on the most cost effective option and route to pursue. 
Call me if you have any questions

In addition, it's my understanding that the border numbers are the take-away 
capacity at the border, not El Paso's delivery capacity.  EP is still down 
several 100 MMBtu/d due to lower line pressure restrictions mandated by Fed 
DOT after the New Mexico explosion.

Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  
Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and 
SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's 
posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput 
information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA 
how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part 
of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please 
reconfirm with other sources.

I thought we agreed all project requests would be submitted in writing to Facility Planning on the Project Sheet we developed.  The Sheet is important in that it highlights certain requirements for a particular project (including due date, contact names, phone numbers, etc.).  You can fill out the sheet on-line and attach it as an email to Eric.  Let me know if you have questions/concerns.

Eric - Could you please provide me with a Level A cost estimate to make the Ft. Wingate delivery point in McKinley County, NM a bi-directional point?  PNM would like to deliver up to 15,000 MMBtu/d to TW if the price is right.  Thank you.

Below is a new well Phillip's has completed in the Panhandle that appears 
to be very close to a TW pipeline.  Would you be the person I would 
discuss a possible interconnect with TW?

Trumbell #3, Morrow test.  Sherman County, Texas.  999' FNL & 974' FWL, 
Section 246-Blk1T-T&NO Survey.  Perforated morrow interval.  Well kick off 
        and flowed ~ 8.5 MMcfd, fp 625 psi.  Shut in well w/1025 psi at 
wellhead.  Shut well for pipeline connect.  Recommend high pressure connect.

There will be a total of 22 people invited to the HH and PP.  Last year PF 
Changs set up the appropriate # of tables in a corner by the window which was 
great.  Maybe we could get a similar setup this year.

from.  

Audrey - the HH should be from 4 - 6:30

Invitation List:

Julie Reams  Burlington
Carla Johnson  Conoco

Jerry and Arnold,

Here are our comments on the letter to Nuovo Pignone.  Please don't hesitate to call me if you need additional information or have any questions.  Thank you for all of the support that you have provided us on this project. 

Arnold, do you usually have someone from legal review these type of letters?  We would be happy to help you do this, if you like.  Just let me know.  

Thanks, 
Kim.

Please find attached a draft letter from us to Nuovo Pignone regarding the partial commitment (3 of 4 units) on the Red Rock project.  They had indicated that 13 June was the absolute last day we could respond, so the letter will be dated as such.

Your comments are solicited by the close of business tomorrow.  Kim, I assume you will review and comment for Steve Harris.

Thanks,

Lindy,

	This is missing the pool cuts. The system will cut in the following order:
	
	Cut IT by price 1st (Overrun & IT)
	Cut pro-rata Outside the path transactions next in this order:
	1.	Alt. Receipt to Alt. Delivery(outside the path)
	2.	Alt. Receipt to Primary Delivery (Outside the Path)
	3.	Primary Pool Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Outside the Path)
	4.	Primary Physical Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Outside the Path)
	Cut pro-rata Inside the path transactions next in this order:
	1.	Alt. Receipt to Alt. Delivery(Inside the path)
	2.	Alt. Receipt to Primary Delivery (Inside the Path)
	3.	Primary Pool Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Inside the Path)
	4.	Primary Physical Receipt to Alt. Delivery (Inside the Path)
	Cut Pro-rata any primary to primary transactions next in this order:
	1.	Primary Pool Receipt to Primary Delivery
	2.	Primary Physical Receipt to Primary Delivery

Keep in mind some of the other factors when scheduling like evening & I/D 1 cycles are bump cycles.
Once Alt. is scheduled in a cycle . it can not be bumped by primary firm, Incremental gas is cut before flowing gas, TW's FTS3 & EFHB are scheduled in a separate transmission and point allocation process, & LFT is scheduled to zero during the rollover and balance process if we have called No LFT available, otherwise, LFT is scheduled like Firm. 


 
Thanks Ramona

After reviewing the list of issues to be addressed, it looks like we would want to keep an eye on this proceeding but I don't think we will need to take an active position. If you see anything that may directly impact the value of our capacity or access to our system through PG&E then let me know. Thanks.

Kevin - would you like to join me and Michelle when I go over the contract 
generation process for this next bid week period?  I think you would find it 
interesting in terms of better understanding the range of responsibilities I 
have which are associated with the contract generation, documentation and 
especially discount letter generation.  Also, starting immediately, there 
will be an additional step required for the purposes of 637 posting 
requirements which Michelle will need to be familiar with in addition to 
these other back-up responsibilities.    I will be in a Derivative training 
class next Tuesday and Wednesday, the primary days when a few TK deals will 
be needing to be processed.  I can either meet with you and Michelle this 
Friday or next Monday.  Thanks.

Just wanted to know I am working on your behalf...
I'll let you know what Shelley says.  
I really feel a need to keep the EOL guys honest, so a full-fledged agreement 
would probably not be overkill.  But in reality, a term sheet is probably 
almost as good.

Subject: agreement with EOL

Shelley, I understand that there is a concern about TW having a written 
agreement with EOL without the other two pipelines having an agreement.

>From my perspective, TW needs an agreement because TW is uniquely situated.  
Here's why.

- My understanding is that TW is the only pipeline that has been asked to pay 
a fee.

- The developers Michelle Lokay and I have been talking to seem very 
uncertain about exactly what the fee covers.

-  $50,000 is a lot of money to Transwestern.

-   Transwestern has a recent history of not getting what it thought it had 
bargained for from affiliated companies, and would appreciate our trying to 
protect them.

I am not trying to create extra work for anyone.  I am just a little confused 
about why a contract for TW would necessitate a contract for the other 2 
companies.  If you could help me understand, I would appreciate it.  

If the consensus is that we feel strongly that TW should not have a written 
agreement, then I would at least insist on a detailed letter of intent or 
term sheet.  This would force both sides to think ahead about what is 
expected.  (And, as a practical matter, it's highly unlikely that we're going 
to take legal action for breach of contract against an affiliate...)

Thanks.

Subject: TW Cash for Fuel meeting

Please plan to attend a follow up meeting to discuss possible system changes 
needed to implement TW Cash for fuel tariff changes. The IT staff is in the 
process ot trying to prepare a draft estimate for system cost, and have many 
questions on this process.  I have attached the  draft of system changes that 
I put together last month based on the meeting that we had with marketing.  
We will be discussing this list of proposed system requirements to determine 
if additional changes are needed.

The meeting is Wednesday 6/14/00 at 9:00 to 10:30 in room 4053A



Thanks Ramona

Based on our conversations, attached is a worksheet with current basis for
SoCal Needles.  Please view the latest date spreadsheet.

 <<available money for demand fees 05_2001.xls>>

Also as we discussed, the market is currently not showing us basis bids for
PG&E Topock.  Therefore, USGT/Aquila would like you to consider $0.10 per
MMBtu for Transwestern's capacity to PG&E Topock.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Steve / Julia, if this is OK, will you please forward to all Market Services 
members.
thanks

Pursuant to our conversation today, we will implement the following change in 
the way Market Services allocates the California delivery points:

Historically we have allocated the border as an area.  Effective 9/18/00 
until further notice, we will allocate the border by individual points.

If SoCal windows TW down to a number less than the standard 750,000 MMBtu/d, 
then we will allocate shipper noms down to the window total.
PGE and Mojave points will be individually allocated to their capacities as 
well.

If the opportunity arises whereby gas allocated at Needles can be moved to 
Topock or Mojave, then Market Services should work with the Shippers to 
accommodate their needs.

The West of Thoreau area should not exceed the 1,090,000 MMBtu/d capacity 
constraint.

Any questions can be directed to Steve January, TK Lohman, or Darrell 
Schoolcraft.

It is that time of year.... Please complete your list of accomplishments by the end of November.  

Also, please complete your 2002 Objectives by December 14.  Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002.  As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting.  Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right.   

I will be happy to visit with each of you individually if you have any questions or would like to discuss these items.    :>)

Thanks,
Kim.

I know what I think of this deal, but I'd like to hear your thoughts.  Just 
some numbers to think about while you're mulling this deal over.  The deal 
provides for a doubling of the reservation charges/mo. from approx. $90K to 
$180K.  Then, USGT has an option on traunches of $.10, $.20 and $.38 capacity 
to move gas west on an alt. basis.  The current (paper) market for Permian to 
Cal. Border during the period is in the range of $1.00.  All other terms are 
the same, including the "sharing mechanism."

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.  

thanks

 Terminability of Val Verde interconnect agreement

I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA "at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions.

Shelley,
In addition to the valuable discussion notes you've listed in your memo, here 
are some things I'd like to see covered:

1.  Report card on the financial success of the first series of merchant 
plants.

2.  The growth in the secondary market (2nd and 3rd owners) for generation 
facilities.

3.  Brief discussion of the basic economic differences (capital vs. O&M & 
fuel) of fully depreciated (formerly utility) electric generation facilities 
and the latest generation high efficiency gas turbines, and the 
implications/opportunities for gas suppliers/transporters.

4.  Understanding of the contractual nature of electric power sales, long 
term contracts vs. merchant sales into PX markets, and the implications of 
these contractual arrangements on gas suppliers/transporters.

Thanks for putting this together for us.

Please plan to attend an in-house training session on an "Introduction to the 
Electric Industry."   Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT  is preparing a day-long 
seminar customized to our interests and issues.   

Here is my "top 4 list" on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding 
of the electric industry.

First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market for 
gas pipelines.  We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being 
built and who the likely customers are.  This involves understanding the 
different between utility generation and merchant plants, the dynamics of 
siting, understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically 
justify generation investments.
Second, we need to understand electric utilities as customers.  Who is the 
customer these days -- the generator?  Who should we be dealing with within 
the utility organization.  What types of load patterns should we expect 
various types of electric players?  What types of services do they need?  We 
also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes 
compare/contrast to our processes on the gas side.
Third, we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and 
the implications for electric generation demand growth.  We need to 
understand the state/federal jurisdictional issues.  We need to learn about 
the debates over ATC, TLR, locational marginal pricing, price caps, and 
control areas.  We need to understand how these issues fit into Enron's 
position in support of restructuring the electric industry, unbundling 
transmission, removing native load exceptions, and avoiding prices caps and 
we need to understand how these debates affect GPG.
 Fourth, we need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services and 
OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and 
electric.  The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on 
the gas side.  FERC is talking about imposing the RTO principles on 
pipelines. And, we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline 
EBBs.  We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices 
where it makes sense and on the flip side, know how to argue against the 
imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate 
differences between gas and electric.

I've shared this list of interests with Jim Crist as he prepares a customized 
seminar for us.  Please feel free to email me with any other areas of 
interest for the course.   I will keep you posted on the specific location as 
things progress.  In the meantime, please make sure to save the date!   
Please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may be 
interested.

While we don't intend to provide this draft to Oneok, it will enable us to assist them if they ask for drafting suggestions (they will more than likely be on a short time fuse).  Please let me know if either of you has any comments...................Tony

Kim,

You might want to get on the distribution of this report.  I have wondered 
and asked the question "Do we always cover variable operating costs on our 
park and ride deals"?  A ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use.  
Doesn't the Deal Analysis cover park & ride deals?  You might want to check 
into this.

Thanks........Terry

Lindy and Michelle--

Thanks for taking the time to meet with me yesterday to discuss DealBench and 
the IOS process.  I will work with my technical team to schedule a meeting 
sometime next week with you and Rich Abromowitz. 

Michelle-- when you get a chance, can you please fax to my attention the 
screen shots from an IOS auction that contained some of the complexities we 
discussed yesterday?  I have verified that Enron Net Works is a separate 
legal entity from ENA so I think we are okay from that standpoint.  My fax 
number is 713-646-8576.

Thanks so much,

Ross Mesquita

To follow up on our phone conversation this morning...you had found an additional 7,692 MMbtu/day of West Texas receipts available during the months of 11/02, 12/02, 01/03, and 02/03.  Let's allocate this to the remaining 2 shippers still looking for West Texas supply.  Please allocated on the administrative contract as follows:  3,735 will go to PP&L (will still need additional 2,000) and 3,957 allocated to Calpine (still needing 2,514).  The remaining volumes will have locations to be determined in the "east of thoreau" areas.  Paperwork forthcoming.  Thanks.

We will need to keep reminding them of how much money they are making when 
they start to complain about the construction cost.  By the time we get power 
there, install the flow control equipment, and install the new EFM, we will 
probably be close to $70,000.

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed filing, TW opened the floor for questions and comments.  Here is a 
summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

FYI...Burlington will "probably" send an amendment request tomorrow for April through October delivery changes.  The contract of 80,000/day will be split as follows:
26,000/day at Oasis for all 7 months
30, 000/day at ANR Red Deer for all 7 months
24,000/day at WNG Canadian River for April-May, 24,000/day at PEPL Hansford for June-Oct

Perry, you'd checked this capacity for me Monday.  Is it still available?

Capacity Marketing - We negotiated an extension of the 400,000 MMBtu/d 
east-to-east contract with Aquila / USGT this week plus improved the 
economics of their existing contract.  The extension, beginning November 
2001, has a reservation rate of $.025/MMBtu with a 30% sharing of the Permian 
to Cal Border index spreads on all alternate westward flow.  As for their 
existing contract, we negotiated a $.15/MMBtu rate effective February 15 - 
October 31, 2001 on the alternate west flow, an improvement of $.11/MMBtu.  

In addition, we negotiated a similar east deal with alternate west flow with 
Astra Power LLC.  Their reservation rate is $.0325/MMBtu on a volume of 
50,000/d for a term of March 2001 through March 2003.  

With the execution of these two deals plus the anticipated closing of the 
Public Service of New Mexico contract, this will effectively sell out the 
east end of the TW system through at least 2002.

San Juan Flow Conditioner - The decision was made this week to postpone till 
March the application of the Exxon/Nalco flow conditioner in the San Juan 
lateral.  Had we proceeded with the application in February (a tariff month), 
the minimum lost revenue impact for one day could have been $300,000.

SouthWest Gas - We received the fully executed OBA contract from SouthWest 
Gas this week.

Gas Inventory - With moderating temperatures out west reducing demand and 
shippers paying gas back to TW, we were experiencing high linepack for most 
of the week.  TW was able to sell 55,000 MMBtu at the border for a net 
revenue of $453,000.

Reliant - We negotiated a San Juan Pool contract for 20,000 MMBtu/d at max 
rates for February 6-28.  Reliant is flowing alternate out of path from San 
Juan to the border and scheduling 5,000 to 12,000 MMBtu/d.  Incremental 
revenue for this could range from $42,000 to $100,000 for the month.

Marc, here is a summary of TW's notes regarding the events leading up to flowing gas on the Pronghorn well.  Everything looked to be pretty good until 11/13 and then it was crunch time.  

Please let me know if you have anything materially different than what we show.

Best Regards,

For your convenience and/or use by your customers, I've revised the proposed term sheet to include the two (2) altenative sharing mechanisms that your customers should base their bids upon.  This term sheet also includes a second example of how the sharing mechanism works.

Subject:	Additional bid criteria

We've been asked to go back to the shippers and secure two (2) bids on the capacity.   Ask your shippers to look at the term sheet and give us a bid on (1) the [original] 30% sharing mechanism on alternate west flows, and (2) a 50% sharing mechanism on alternate west flows.  Let them know we realize that the 50% sharing mechanism will likely result in a reduced reservation rate, however, we'd like to see both "looks" at the deal.  Also, whether we choose the structure with a 30% sharing, or the 50% sharing, let them know that we'll make our decision on best bid [on Friday] based on the highest NPV of reservation bid.

Richard, I took the liberty of reformatting your imbalance spreadsheet a 
little to be able to sort the numbers by volume and dollar amount (see 
attached). 

As you update the numbers, would you please send the info to all market team 
members as well (see above).  We want to be more proactive in managing the 
imbalances and staying on top of those operator / shippers that are gaming TW.

thanks

Here's the latest version of the internal posting and bidding procedures for TW.  Note that it still says "DRAFT" at the top, as I predict this will go thru at least one more round of fine-tuning before it's officially adopted.

Could you replace our recent posting on the EBB with the attached document.  
We've just corrected the name of "Enron Oil & Gas" to "EOG Resources".  I 
don't think it's necessary to put "Revised" or anything on it, unless we have 
to.  I'd just like to replace it (or if you can go in and make that change, 
that's okay too).  Let me know.

Thanks,
Lindy

After many conversations with John Havard at Pogo, it was decided that we will not continue with the Transwestern interconnect in the Pronghorn area.  The drilling results were not as optimistic as they originally thought, producing much less than 8,000/day.  Their facilities are also much closer to both a Conoco and a El Paso interconnect of less than 1/2 mile away versus us at 4 miles.  I am assuming we have spent up to the prepaid amount of $35000 and do not need to issue a refund.  If anything changes, I'll let you guys know.  Thanks again!

Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.

Subject:	Re: Pogo Interconnect

There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks

Subject:	Re: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the facilities asap.

Subject:	Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Until we have answered the FERC data requests, please do not engage in any discussions with Sid or Sempra or any outside party on that subject.  If they contact us, refer them to me.  If any "ordinary course of business" conversations are necessary between now and Tuesday COB with Sid or Sempra , and the subject comes up, refer them to me.  I'll coordinate a meeting  Mon. am so we can decide how to address this with the outside world if at all.  DF

The GD article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade=
rs=20
Digest version of the order.  Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=
=20
Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20
Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=
=20
implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=
=20
Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=
=20
didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=
=20
ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other=
=20
Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar=
k=20
and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=
's=20
role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=
=20
first before committing to anything.

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=
=20
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=
stem.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=
g=20
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=
e=20
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=
=20
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that=
=20
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=
o the=20
draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=
ment]=20
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=
=20
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=
=20
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=
=20
with modifications, of the IS.=018

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=
=20
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=
=20
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=
l=20
to automatically
expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of=
=20
curtailments oc-curred. =20
El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele=
r=20
when only certain customers would benefit. =20
The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge=
=20
expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce=
ss.

The draft decision would also:
=01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp=
ers=01, ability to=20
change nominations
for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an=

more changes
in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made;
=01=07 Set up =01&pools=018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar=
e intended to=20
increase the
liquidity of gas trading;
=01=07 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% mon=
thly=20

tolerance;
=01=07 Make SoCal=01,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci=
ng rules=20
and penalties
as all other shippers;
=01=07 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assig=

reassign unbundled
storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin=20
board set up
for it;
=01=07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex=
ceeding=20
that required
for core minimum reliability; and
=01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co=
sts.

In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from=
=20
rates, eliminate
core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina=
te=20
the core subscription
option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo=
r=20
participating in
core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20
aggregators.

Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years =
to=20
open another
investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark=
et=20
conditions.
Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft=
.
=01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show=
ing a=20
differential
between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport=
=20
and related services;
we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete=
rs=20
if more competition is allowed,=018=20
Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ=
ed to=20
a
restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the=
=20
benefits of such re-
structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20
time.  With one leg in the
water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not=
=20
foolhardy, to reach our
goals by forging ahead.

=01&We choose to take a cautious approach again,=018 the draft continues. =
=01&Rather=20
than proceeding
to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with=20
modifications, the settle-

The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and=
=20
other restruc-
turing in the future =01&but believe that at this point in time the certain=
=20
benefits do not outweigh
the costs to most ratepayers.=018

All drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be=

draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUC=01,s Dec. 21 meeting=

For the short Thanksgiving week of  November 20th-November 22th:

Transwestern weekly average deliveries to California were 941 MMcf/d (86% - 
due to pipeline maintenance) while east deliveries averaged 310 MMcf/d.  San 
Juan lateral throughput averaged 789 MMcf/d while receipts from Rio Puerco 
averaged 27 MMcf/d.  

El Paso average deliveries to California were 2,491 MMcf/d (85%) :
- PG&ETop (capacity 1,140 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 495 MMcf/d (70%)
- SoCalEhr (capacity 1,250 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 1,102 MMcf/d (88%)
- SoCalTop (capacity 549 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 521 MMcf/d (97%)


Other pipeline throughput to California:
- PGT ( capacity 1,901 MMcf/d) throughput to California averaged 1,627 MMc/d 
(86%).   
-  Kern River (total pipeline capacity 700) throughput to California averaged 
225 MMcf/d (32%). The remaining 475 MMcf/d  (68%) is assumed delivered to the 
Las Vegas market.


The cash PG&E/Topock - SoCal/Needles spread went from  $.80 Monday spread to 
to a $1.23 Wednesday level.

Daily Cash prices were absolutely wild this week at the southern California 
border.  Monday's cash price of $13.42 went to $17.35 by Wednesday.  San Juan 
and Permian cash prices each had some increase and by Wednesday were  $6.32 
and $6.40, respectively.  This price spike occurred despite the fact that 
total California sendout (sum of interstate gas, intrastate production & 
storage withdrawals) decreased from last week's 7.6 BCF/day level to this 
week's level of 7.2 BCF/day.

 Today we reached another milestone on Transwestern for total volumes flowing 
West and down the San Juan Lateral. Our volumes on the lateral were a record 
878,000 dth/d and flowing West were a record !,065,000 dth/d.

 This tremendous accomplishment is due to several factors including the 
success of the TW Commercial Team in fully subscribing all capacity including 
Daily Firm and LFT (there is no more space!).  In addition, the significant 
effort put forth by Market Services, Gas Control, Facility Planning and 
Operations to identify all capacity and make it flow should be recognized. 
Thanks for a job well done and supporting the team effort!

Subject: Keystone Unit Regrout & Ovehaul

Marketing has approved the regrout and overhaul for one of the recip units.  
This is contingent upon a completion date.  Marketing was hoping for 
completion by the end of December.  However, discussions with Engineering 
indicate 7 - 8 weeks for the overhaul and regrout.  By copy of this letter I 
am requested Marketing to approve or disapprove the Keystone work even though 
it will take through January for completion.

Thanks,

Ron M.

Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please reconfirm with other sources.

Subject: Gomez to Puckett Tie-In strategy Issues

Here is the latest status of Transwestern's Gomez to Puckett project on the 
south-end and some of the strategic issues behind this project:

Project Overview:  Tranwestern's Gomez-Puckett Tie-Over project would connect 
Transwestern's Lone Star compressor toTW's most southerly south-end 20" line 
(currently a sour line).  The sour line would be first be cleaned and tested 
for MAOP.  Potential plant connects to this line include the Coyanosa plant 
(currently owned by Koch) and Western's Gomez plants.  Potential incremental 
plant supplies would be 100-150 MMcf/d of supplies.

Scenario 1:  If Transwestern is willing to be completely at risk for the $2 
MM required for the sour line conversion and compression tie-in costs, this 
options currently exists and we could move forward.  These costs do not 
include the individual plant connections, which could easily be 
$400,000-500,000 each.   This would be a relatively high-risk decision.

Scenario 2:  If Transwestern wants shipper contracts to support this project 
in part, or in full, the following significant issues need to be considered:

   -   Possible ownership changes of the Koch Coyanosa plant to Richardson 
Products Company.  There is a moderate to high probability that Richardson 
Products Company will purchase the Coyanosa plant, currently owned by Koch.  
It is in close proximity to their MiVida system which they purchased last 
year and have recently indicated an interest to interconnect with 
Transwestern at the Lone Star, Ward location (cost estimates were complete 
this week).  Koch has confirmed this rumor of potential acquisition.   
Currently Koch has 100 MMcf/d of its own equity gas at the plant, but if the 
rumor of the sale of the plant is correct, I may be dealing directly with 
Richardson Products rather than Koch.   Another factor to be considered with 
this scenario is that if Richardson Products company owns and operates the 
Coyanosa plant, they will already have made some strategic decisions about 
where their 100 MMcf/d of equity gas will go.   It is possible that through 
their MiVida system, Transwestern could have access to this plant gas at 
another locational interconnect with Transwestern without having to spend a 
penny for the line conversion and connection to the Coyanosa Plant.    Bottom 
line is, if Richardson Products does acquire this plant, we needs to take a 
step back and look at other scenarios which may be cheaper for accessing this 
plant's gas.

- Western Gas Resources contract participation issues:  Western Gas Resources 
will eventually have two plants that could be tied into the converted sour 
line:  1) Western's existing Gomez plant, and, 2) the newly to-be-acquired 
plant sold to them by NNG.   The sale of NNG's Gomez to Mitchell line and the 
NNG Gomez plant to Western Gas Resources must occur first.  Western will not 
focus its business attention to the possible connection of either Gomez plant 
to Transwestern's south-end line prior to this event.  They will eventually 
prepare a Declaratory Order to make the newly acquired plant and pipeline 
facilities from NNG non-jurisdictional.   NNG & Western have signed the Sale 
Agreement and the transfer of funds is expected 1st quarter of 2001 subject 
to due-diligence result.  NNG is currently preparing the abandonment filing 
for these assets and Western is in the process of their field due-diligence.  
Environmental issues (some contamination) relative to the asset sale have 
arisen and must be corrected prior to transfer of assets.   All of these 
issues may take a good part of 2001 to be resolved.

To Do's:  Monday (when I assume my beautiful, song-bird voice will return), I 
plan to discuss the interconnect costs of tying in Richardson's 20" MiVida 
line to Transwestern at the Lone Star Ward location.   We received 
Richardson's request for this estimate a couple of weeks ago and the estimate 
is about $320,000 (for facilities) plus $100,000 (tax gross-up)*.   In my 
conversation, I will try to get Brad Brigham to indicate the timing or 
validity of Richardson's possible purchase of this Koch plant.  Once a new 
facts can be obtained, it will make the decision making and risk evaluation 
process of implementing the Gomez to Puckett tie-in project easier to 
understand and take a position on.

Earl,
I am very happy that you are now settled in Roswell, but Planning would still like to know the status of TW/ Oneok project on West Texas Lateral.
Please update us as soon as you can. Marketing expects to receive the associated cost of this project and that is a reimbursable deal.
Regards,
Mansoor

Michelle,

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign 20,000 
mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the period beginning 
June 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002.  During the four month period beginning 
October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 2003, the primary receipts will be 
reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.  Beginning March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary 
receipts will be increased to 20,000 mmbtu.  

For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 
2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options prior to 
electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.

Best Regards
David Smith

Pacific Gas & Electric has sent an expression of interest to purchase pipeline capacity from Topock to Calpine South Point.  They are interested in 50,000 MMBtu/d at .05 for approximately 2 years.  The timing is from when they receive FERC approval (late 2002) until their Section 4 restructuring starts (late 2004).

This morning I received a copy of a draft order on TW's negotiated rate deal with Reliant.  The Commission suspended the proposed negotiated rate, subject to refund and further order by the Commission.  The Commission also consolidated the filing with the other negotiated rate dockets currently underway "for purposes of a further Commission order on Transwestern's negotiated rate contracts under investigation..."

On Monday, September 11, Jean McFarland will meet with our team to briefly 
give an overview of the upcoming installation of Windows 2000.    We will try 
to devote the last 15 minutes of staff meeting time to Jean.   Unlike the 
conference room on the 42nd floor, we will have to be out of EB-4102 by 
10:45am for Julia's Staff Meeting.    This will mean giving abbreviated 
reports. 

Please place this date and time on your calendars.

Thanks in advance,

Hope all is well at the big "E" these days. I just got this updated
California Energy Commission report on natural gas infrastructure issues. I
thought you might find this useful.

I forgot to tell you at our staff meeting that on December 27 FERC approved 
the tariff sheet we filed authorizing TW to grant contractual ROFR rights to 
FTS-1 shippers that do not automatically qualify for such a right.  In other 
words, for contracts that are not maximum rate for more than a year, we can 
still agree to give the shipper a ROFR without having to file the contract as 
a material deviation.

Pogo Producing - Pogo executed their interconnect and operating agreement 
with TW for the new well they anticipate flowing in early February.  We also 
received a  payment for incidental expenses necessary to bring the well into 
TW's system; expected volume is 30,000 MMBtu/d into the West Texas lateral.

Capacity Marketing - We have created 4 packages of transportation capacity 
with terms of 1 to 2 years that we are offering for sale in 2002 and 2003.  
Our desire is to price the space based on spreads between gas indices in San 
Juan, Permian, and Cal Border.  Our objective is to close these deals by 
early next week.

In addition, we have been working with EnronOnline to establish a consistent 
capacity offering of most likely east-end space on their trading platform.  
Automated contracting procedures have been established.  Legal is working on 
the point descriptions and Credit has the potential customer list to set up 
trading limits and approvals.  We should be trading on the system before 
month end.

San Juan Pigging - The pigging project using methanol to clean the lateral 
began this week.  We should know sometime the week of 1/16 if the work had 
the desired effect.

FERC Options Filing - Part of the week was spent strategizing with legal and 
regulatory affairs on various scenarios that will likely come up in the FERC 
technical conference scheduled for next Tuesday, January 9th.  As owners of 
electric generation in California, we have requested both Calpine and Duke 
attend the conference in support of TW.

Tri-State G&T - Tri-State is the generation and transmission electric 
co-operative that serves the Gallup compressor station.  Enron Compressor 
Services executed the confidentiality agreement that enabled TW to get access 
to system load information on Tri-State's web site.  Next we will need to 
build a computer program that monitors the site and automatically notifies 
gas control when a likely electrical peak will be reached on Tri-State's 
system.  If TW is able to turn down the Gallup compressor, based on 
transportation demand, we may be able to avoid some of the peaking electrical 
charges.

Don't Save Passwords
Internet Explorer and some web based applications give you the ability to save your password, so you don't have to type it in each time you access it.  Unfortunately, this time-saver can also get you in trouble when you are forced to change your password and the new password doesn't get saved.  We've had numerous calls to the Help Desk due to old passwords still being "saved".  To keep yourself from being a victim (and for good security), please do not save passwords when prompted.  Some examples are below...
    
  

Don't Update Software or Install Plug-Ins
Most of us have gone to a web site that prompted us to update our software version or shows a link to install a new plug-in so we can see all the fancy web page components.   Many vendor web sites let you download demos of their software.  We need to resist the temptation to do this, since it may not be approved software and could cause applications to malfunction.  This can further lead to difficulty in tracking down the cause of problems, since the workstation is now "non-standard". Only the Omaha IT staff should be installing software.  When in doubt, please contact the Help Desk for assistance.  Examples from web sites are below....Thanks!

FYI,

I have been testing the enhancement changes for LFT contracts that was documented last April and this item will move to production the weekend.  This change will move the LFT validation process from the allocation function to the Rollover and Balance function. To explain,  when TW post a notice that  "No LFT is Available" for a location and gas day, the system will automatically schedule the LFT contract to zero for that day at that point during the 1st scheduling process after the nomination deadline which is called rollover and balance process. The current process today cuts the LFT contracts during our allocation function, which is the last process done on TW. 

We have also added the waiver flag to the contract system that identifies the LFT shippers who have signed the waiver granting TW responsibility to change their nomination from firm to overrun on days when no LFT service is available.
Both Lorraine and TK have a copy of this draft document that I created. Please review this waiver document and finalize any changes to it so this new service can be offered to the shippers. If you would like to post this waiver document to our web site under forms, please let me know.  Finally, the contract team will keep these waiver documents with the LFT contract file, as well as in their waiver log book.

Thanks Ramona

Attached is a draft of procedures for the handling of TW PNR. At the bottom 
of the 1st page are a few issues that need a decision on how TW will handle 
each issue in the future. Please take a few minutes and review this draft and 
return your thoughts and comments to me. I would like to get your comments by 
the end of Wednesday January 31st.  Also, if you think I left anyone off the 
above distribution, please forward a copy to them. 
If needed we can meet Thursday immediately following the Morning meeting(s) 
to finalize any outstanding issues. Please let me know if you have any 
questions.
Thanks.

although
as intimated in this press release, we might see a follow-on expansion noti=

My gut feeling is that they're waiting for more certainty regarding=20

Kern River casts its lot with California expansion
Looking to accommodate demand for gas-fired generation in California,=20
Williams has plans
under way to expand its Kern River Gas Transmission system. The company=20
announced
yesterday that it would file an application with FERC to add an additional=

firm transportation capacity from Wyoming to California markets.
The proposal  called the California Expansion Project  would tap into=20

for a
second expansion of Kern River. According to a company release, Williams=20
plans on holding
an open season later this year to gauge interest in additional capacity on=

the pipeline.
A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power=20

facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system, said Kirk=20
Morgan, director of business
development for Kern River and Northwest Pipeline. Kern River is=20
well-positioned to
pursue an economically attractive expansion of its mainline.
The $80 million project proposal calls for adding three new compressor=20

as boosting or retooling existing facilities in Wyoming and Utah. Williams=

also plans to upgrade
two meter stations. The project=01,s anticipated in-service date is May 1, =

Back in August, Kern River held an open season to determine interest in fir=

According to Williams, demand for new capacity out of Wyoming is being driv=

by a
number of factors, including a shift in downstream markets for Canadian=20
supply and strong
economic growth in Kern River=01,s market areas. Surging demand for gas-fir=

also played a role.
Morgan said a ramp-up in Rockies production coupled with demand for=20

The latest changes to the Interactive Open Season application have been moved 
into production and are ready for testing.  These modifications include:

Displaying the actual bids along with the evaluated bids on each of the 
detail lines.  This will allow shippers to see the actual bid rate for all 
bids greater than max rate.
Calculating the winning bids based on evaluated bid and term only (ignore

Forcing shippers to bid on the full volume of the package.

The modifications do not include:

Allowing users to supersede any of their own bids greater than or equal to 
max rate.  Because this modification introduces a high risk factor, it will 
be made after Fiday's IOS.


Because some of these modifications affect the way in which bids are ranked, 
thorough testing by the Marketing team should be completed before any 
shippers are allowed to enter the system.

Attached below is the CPUC's proposed decision in the Gas Industry=20
Restructuring proceeding.  Essentially, it adopts the Interim Proposal with=
 a=20
few modifications.  The CPUC states that they are taking a "cautious"=20
approach to deregulation in light of recent market events in both electrici=
ty=20
and gas, and therefore, rejected the more robust reforms outlined in the=20
Comprehensive Settlement.  The CS was offered by SoCal Gas and supported by=
=20
many of the settlement parties, including Enron and Transwestern.

The good news is that, with respect to Hector Road, the maximum volume at=
=20
Hector is limited to 50 MMcf/d, similar to the proposal made by the=20
Comprehensive Settlement.  I've included the section from the PD that deals=
=20
with this issue for your convenience.  The full document is also attached.

excerpt at at page 50 regarding Hector Road:

(1) Receipt Points/ Intrastate Transmission
As we have already discussed above, we now judge that intrastate transmissi=
on=20
unbundling is not wise at this time for the SoCalGas system.  However,=20
SoCalGas=01, intrastate transmission system can still be made more accessib=
le=20
and understandable to its users.
In R. 98-01-011, the record reflects dissatisfaction among customers and=20
shippers with the lack of clarity on how SoCalGas schedules gas shipments=
=20
through its windowing system, and SoCalGas=01, sole use of the Hector Road=
=20
interconnection as a receipt point. (Exh. 8 in R. 98-01-011, pp. 29-31=20
(Southern California Edison Company Market Conditions Report), (Panel Heari=
ng=20
Testimony of  Mr. Paul Carpenter, Southern California Edison, Tr. pp.=20
931-932, Jan 25, 1999).) Our decision in D. 99-07-015 directed investigatio=
n=20
into using the Hector Road interconnection, even on an interim basis, and t=
he=20
publication of SoCalGas=01, windowing criteria in tariffs.  SoCalGas filed=
=20
Advice Letter 2837, which detailed its process of basing a maximum amount o=
f=20
gas scheduled for shipment through a receipt point on the prior day=01,s=20
nominations, except at the first of the month.  Early in the instant=20
proceeding, the ALJ held in abeyance active consideration of the windowing=
=20
procedure tariff SoCalGas filed, pending the resolution we reach today. =20
(Prehearing Conference of September 1, 1999, p. 34.)
We are approving on an interim basis the replacement of the current windowi=
ng=20
process with a system under which SoCalGas will establish receipt point=20
capacities, subject to daily revision, on the basis of the physical maximum=
s=20
for each receipt point under the operating conditions expected for that day=
. =20
Customers and shippers will know the daily maximums because they will be=20
posted on SoCalGas=01, GasSelect system daily prior to the nomination=20
deadlines.  If, in the aggregate, customers nominate more than the physical=
=20
capacity at any receipt point, gas will be scheduled based on the upstream=
=20
pipeline=01,s capacity rights system.  For Wheeler Ridge, at which more tha=
n one=20
upstream pipeline delivers gas, the maximum daily physical capacity would b=
e=20
allocated between upstream sources pro rata on the basis of the prior day=
=01,s=20
scheduled deliveries from each source.
This system eliminates the mystery in how pro-rations are made, provides=20
continuity in capacity rights between the interstate and intrastate systems=
=20
and provides flexibility for customers in nominating at the most=20
cost-effective receipt point on any given day.  We recognize that it does n=
ot=20
provide for long-term planning, but the alternative under the CS of paid-fo=
r=20
firm receipt point rights for the term of the settlement has the disadvanta=
ge=20
of locking customers into a receipt point that may lose value over the term=
. =20
In this period of gas price volatility, we believe that the more flexible=
=20
plan is the right one.
Thus, we direct SoCalGas to withdraw Advice Letter 2837 and file a new advi=
ce=20
letter within 10 business days implementing the proposed receipt point=20
physical capacity system.  This may be the same as the exemplary tariff fil=
ed=20
with the IS or updated as necessary pursuant to subsequent proceedings.  Th=
is=20
tariff revision will be effective within 30 days after the filing unless=20
rejected by the Energy Division.
In R.98-01-011, PG&E and Edison particularly complained about the=20
restrictions at Wheeler Ridge. (Exh. 15 in R. 98-01-11, pp. 7-9 (PG&E=20
Rebuttal to Market Conditions Report), and Exh.8 in R. 98-01-011, pp. 29-31=
,=20
(Southern California Edison, Market Conditions Report).) One response in th=
e=20
IS to these complaints is the establishment of a formal receipt point at=20
Hector Road for all customers, subject to Wheeler Ridge access fees and=20
surcharges.  Its capacity will be 50 MMcfd or greater as long as there are=
=20
nominations of that volume and Mojave Pipeline Company delivers that much i=
n=20
response to those nominations.  This provision should allow greater=20
flexibility for shippers and customers as well as leveling the playing fiel=
d=20
between SoCalGas and others at this interconnection.  We will support=20
SoCalGas=01, application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for=20
approval of Hector Road as a formal delivery point by Mojave.
El Paso Natural Gas Company objected strongly to the provision in the IS fo=
r=20
automatically expanding of Wheeler Ridge capacity  While this was not an=20
option specifically mentioned in D.99-07-015, we do not choose to stand on=
=20
that technicality to exclude it from consideration here.  Once a proceeding=
=20
is open to settlement, the dynamics of settlement talks may bring in matter=
s=20
outside the delineated scope, as they have done here with regard to Wheeler=
=20
Ridge expansion and, for instance, pooling.  Both proposals respond to=20
concerns raised in R.98-01-011, (see citations in text above as well as Pan=
el=20
Hearing Testimony of Mr. Benjamin C. Campbell, PG&E, Tr. pp. 267-268, Jan 1=
9,=20
1999)) and neither was specifically excluded from further consideration in=
=20
D.99-07-015.  We therefore view them as within the scope of this proceeding=
. =20
To the extent that other receipt points are also viewed as constrained, we=
=20
welcome evidence to that effect in a future proceeding, as well as proposal=
s=20
for criteria to determine when expansion should be applied for.  by 100MMcf=
d=20
if a certain number of curtailments occurred, and for automatically allowin=
g=20
the expenses of that expansion to be rolled into rates.  We do not wish to=
=20
approve automatic rate increases for all ratepayers for a facility for whic=
h=20
only some may have use, but we believe that developing criteria for expansi=
on=20
of receipt points is useful.  Hector Road may not entirely alleviate the=20
problem of constraints on northern gas flowing to the south.
Therefore, we approve that portion of Section III of the IS that sets forth=
=20
criteria for expansion, but provide that upon the meeting of that criteria,=
=20
SoCalGas shall submit an application for an expansion of the receipt point=
=20
capacity.  That application shall be processed in the regular way, with the=

issues of need in the context of the entire system and foreseeable market=
=20
conditions considered.  Moreover,  rolled-in or incremental rates, allocati=
on=20
of cost among classes and consequent rate design will remain open for=20
decision in that proceeding.
Thus, the modification to the IS that we make is in the first sentence of t=

after =01&SoCalGas will=018.  We specifically disapprove the IS language in=

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides information for September 2001 invoicing.  The spreads to the California border narrowed during the month of September.  Therefore, two of the three index-based packages released by PG&E (Core) are below TW's max tariff rate and the third should be billed using the floor defined on the offer ($0.4455/dth), which does exceed the max tariff rate.
TW Schedulers - I have left a copy of the flash invoices (processed as of late Friday) for all capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts in Amy's chair for your final disposition.  I have flagged all which may require some additional review/correction on your part.  I will be on a flight out Monday lunchtime for customer training and will not be back in the office until Thursday.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by pager (800-718-0830).

Subject:	Red Rock Admin Contract

I have run across an issue with the Admin contract.

Don't worry, the overall solution is still good!  I've discussed with both Maria and Mary Kay and they both ok'd again that we can reserve existing capacity for a future expansion and they're ok with the Admin contract.

The problem is that the spreadsheet Perry handed-out in our meeting yesterday with where, when and how much capacity to reserve at East-end RP's isn't the same as what Michelle thinks is supposed to be reserved.  I've been unable to get with Perry yet today to talk with him.  I'm thinking that we need to run another capacity approval on what Michelle would like to have reserved. 

Perry's message says he is out today.  I'm not sure when he will be back.  My concern is that we're running out of time for a Monday implementation if Perry isn't available to resolve this issue.  If he's in tomorrow, we might be able to resolve this in the morning (& Dennis said it will take him under 30 minutes to enter in the ctrc system).  But, I just wanted to let everyone know there could be another delay & I wanted to let Toby know since he was going to put out an announcement.

I'll update you on the status of this issue tomorrow.

Interactive Open Season - TW held its third IOS of the year this week for 
14,000 MMBtu/d of space from East of Thoreau to PG&E Topock.  Ten parties 
originally registered to bid of which 7 actually participated.  The high bid 
was Reliant at $.138.

Gallup Compressor - A meeting was held with Operations, Regulatory, and 
Facility Planning personnel to review the performance of the new compressor 
station.  Currently, the vibration level has increased.  The unit and lateral 
efficiency are a continuing concern.  Operations plans to pull the unit apart 
in early September for an evaluation.  At this time, the anticipated 30,000 
MMBtu/d of "additional" capacity we hoped to have is now not available.  
There is also concern that we may be unable to meet our currently subscribed 
FT obligation.

El Paso All American - We attended the El Paso Pipeline meeting this week as 
they described their FERC filing to begin the conversion of the All American 
Pipeline from oil to gas.  They reiterated several times to attending 
shippers that the project would not offer any incremental space to the main 
line.  El Paso's filing centers around the cost and fuel savings from 
decommissioning very old compressor equipment on their south system and 
replacing the capacity with the All American line.  The cost figures 
(conversion and acquisition) that El Paso filed tracked very closely with 
what Transwestern estimated in its evaluation of the pipe.  The in-service 
date is expected to be July 1, 2001.

Transport Options - TW Commercial reps met with marketing and regulatory 
personnel from Burlington Resources, Conoco, and Texaco this week to review 
the proposed Transport Options Tariff filing.  The meeting was very positive 
and constructive.  Several suggestions were made that led to the realization 
that the best course of action would be to delay the actual tariff filing and 
have a working group meeting in the Houston office.  Everyone agreed that as 
much preliminary work as possible should be done before the filing to make 
the whole process less contentious and to garner more customer support for 
the tariff.  We are trying to schedule the working group session for the 
third week of August.

Crawford Lateral - A line leak on the lateral this week reduced flow from 
50,000 MMBtu/d to zero.  Operations initially estimated 2-3 days of down time 
but actually only required 12 hours.  Approximately 55 feet of line was 
replaced.

El Paso Measurement Letter - Stan Horton forwarded the "mis-measurement" 
letter to El Paso management this week.  We will follow up in approximately 
two weeks if they don't respond sooner.

Operator Imbalances - Met with Market Services personnel to review operator 
imbalances across TW's system.  Marketing is supportive of Gas Control's 
efforts to limit the imbalances and begin allocations if operators schedule 
gas and then can't deliver.  With proactive balance management, there is 
opportunity to realize greater Park 'N Ride revenue.

TransColorado Shipper Meeting - Kevin Hyatt will be attending the 
TransColorado shipper meeting this week in Boulder.  Christine Stokes 
attended the Colorado Oil & Gas Association meeting.

I have set up POI 78269 for this fuel delivery. I need someone to provide the following information in order to complete setup of the POI.

Is the West Texas Supply basin correct?
Is the East of Thoreau Area correct?
Should the point have GRI yes or no?
What is the Lateral ID to be used?
What is the Marketing Lateral ID to be used?

Thanks

Karen

For the week August 21-25th:

Transwestern's weekly average deliveries to California were 1,042 MMcf/d 
while east deliveries averaged 436 MMcf/d.  San Juan lateral averaged 840 
MMcf/d while receipts from Rio Puerco averaged 66 MMcf/d.  Window Rock 
receipts steadily increased throughout the week from a first of week level of 
66 MMcf/d to an end of week level of 117 MMcf/d.    Mojave deliveries were 
fairly strong given a range of 50-120 MMcf/d throughout the week.    By 
Friday, Transwestern was almost at the 2 BCF/d total throughput level. 

El Paso deliveries to California averaged a 57% throughput level of 1,662 
MMcf/d:

- PG&ETop (capacity 1,140 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 530 MMcf/d, down 176 
MMcf/d from last Friday

- SoCalEhr (capacity 1,230 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 613 MMcf/d, down 578 
MMcf/d from last Friday

- SoCalTop (capacity 542 MMcf/d) deliveries averaged 519 MMcf/d, similar to 
last Friday.

In the week since El Paso's rupture, their total decrease in throughput to 
California appears to have averaged approximately 758 MMcf/d. 

Other pipeline throughput:

- PGT ( capacity 1,937 MMcf/d) throughput to California averaged 1,886 MMc/d 
or 97% throughput.
-  Kern River (capacity 700) throughput to California averaged 384 MMcf/c.

Basis trend for the week:    Progressive and steady widening of the Sept & 
Oct Perm-California basis from a .85-.90 first of week spread to an end of 
week 2.01 level.

I sympathize with your desire to obtain incremental revenues, but I think 
PNM's representation to its own system shippers might have made that task 
more difficult.  I fielded a call from Carla Johnson with Conoco indicating 
that in its recent open season for this capacity, PNM told parties that it 
wasn't really relevant whether a shipper had primary firm take away on TW 
from the point, what really mattered is whether the shipper had firm on PNM 
in order to get it there.   This issue surfaced when I told Carla that all of 
the firm takeaway (receipt point) capacity had already been taken.

The point here is that we might have shippers (successfully) using alt. 
receipt rights under existing contracts at discounted rates to receive firm 
gas off PNM.  If PNM controls the upstream capacity, then (effectively) they 
dictate the downstream parties' rights.  This poses little to no risk to East 
- East shippers, more risk of getting cut to the East - West shippers.

Subject: Rio Puerco

PNM is setting additional compression at Rio Puerco which will allow them to 
flow an incremental 25,000 MMBtu/d to Transwestern effective 5/1/01.  In 
marketing this incremental point capacity, we expect to receive incremental 
revenue from shippers who request Rio Puerco as a primary point.

Michelle and Perry - When you receive a shipper request for Rio Puerco 
capacity please get approval from one of the TW marketers before approving 
the request.  Perry - Make the adjustment to the point capacity at Rio Puerco 
effective 5/1/01.

Darrell - Please adjust the point capacity on the posted capacity reports as 
well as the point capacity in the system.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Lorraine

Attached is SoCal's filing of their peaking service for bypass customers including the specific rates by customer class.  Given the recent press with the dissatisfaction of the rates by Questar/Southern Trails, I would expect they will protest the Advice Letter filing.  I'll continue to monitor the proceeding and any protests filed.  gh

Thanks, EC!  FYI - The last four items, starting with the Bristol, the two
transmitters and the sensors should be taken off this list to EOG since
these went to WT-1.  This will reduce the cost by $7698.

Dear Bob,

Good try, but I need more, so I'll help you out.

Term : Initial term of 5 years, with an additional 5 year term at e prime's
election. Notification 6 months before end of contract
Interconnect: On Pressure Control, range from +/- 85,000. Any significant
change in volume to be communicated between two control
	rooms if after hours.
Gas can be transported from West Texas, Central Texas, or Midcontinent Pools
to this TW-Nichols connection.
OBA will allow for +/- 10,000 mmbtu/day, maximum of +/-100,000 mmbtu/d
Imbalance outside of the above will be moved on/off the next business day
Up to 30,000 mmbtu/d can be exchanged from TW-Nichols to other Xcel/Utility
plants on NNG. Transport charges will be same as this
	transport. The TW-NNG exchange volumes will count toward the annual
commitments. Any volumes above this amount will be
	at mutually agreed upon transport charges.
Any volumes above the 10 BCF specified in Bob's brief letter, will be made
at a mutually agreeable demand charge plus fuel if applicable.
Transport fuel is currently at 1.31%, but could change in future years.


Is there storage on TW ???
The JV between NNG and E Prime will not preclude this agreement.

High Prices Put a Damper on Industrial Demand

     Gas producers must be wringing their hands in glee as futures prices top 
$4.45/MMBtu, but some of their customers
     clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing 
some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down
     their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make 
ends meet. 

     WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will 
lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the
     ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural 
gas. Other observers are expecting much larger
     losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss 
of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in
     the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial 
end users switch over to fuel oil. But those
     numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, 
both of which currently exceed the price of
     natural gas per Btu. 

     "Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies 
are better off shutting down their plants right now
     and selling the gas into the market," said one chemical plant supply 
manager, who asked to remain anonymous. "It's
     terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are 
pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's
     the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be 
making cost right now otherwise. We might be
     at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in 
September of last year, which was a pretty
     good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day. A 
number of fertilizer companies have closed
     up." 

     It's difficult to say when it becomes uneconomic to produce fertilizer 
because each plant is unique with its specific
     depreciation rate and costs, noted Dennis Lee, manager of energy and 
feedstock for Sask Ferco Products Inc., a
     partnership of Cargil and the Saskatchewan government. Lee's plant is 
one of the largest ammonia and urea producers in
     the world. It uses about 75 MMcf/d. Regardless of the unique 
circumstances of each plant, however, it's clear most of
     the companies will have to put out a lot of cash in the next few months 
to stay producing, said Lee. "From a credit
     perspective, some of the weaker companies may be in a credit crunch. 
There have been a couple of announcements of
     prolonged shut-downs in the Gulf Coast region recently because of high 
gas prices. 

     "People are getting antsy" because of a potential fertilizer shortage in 
the fall, he said. "Overall, I don't think it's a very
     healthy time for our industry. There could be some restructuring because 
of it." 

     He said it "doesn't look like" his plant is in any danger of a shut-down 
"at this point" because it is very close to its
     customer base in the Midwest and has a high efficiency factor, much 
higher than its older competitors in the Gulf Coast
     and Midcontinent regions. But the outlook does not look as good for many 
of his competitors, he said. 

     Procter & Gamble recently turned to energy procurement over the Internet 
in an attempt achieve greater purchasing
     efficiency and lower prices. It is posting requests for quotes (RFQ) for 
a number of its facilities on a new transaction
     website, www.energygateway.com, as part of its exploration of new 
avenues for supply acquisition. "We're in the early
     stages of experimenting with this," a P&G buyer said. (See Daily GPI, 
June 13) P&G, which like most very large energy
     using manufacturers, continues to do its buying and risk management 
in-house, plans to post more RFQs on the
     energygateway.com website. 

     "We're looking for other opportunities to try out and evaluate. We're 
always looking for ways to bring value to our
     company," the P&G buyer said. "It's not a good time to be a buyer in the 
energy market. We're re-evaluating our
     approaches. We don't want to just be a victim of the market."

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Texaco K #25923/25924 Comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4.5% between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes, there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding.  Need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes; and if delivery makeup scheduled, then invoice should be adjusted accordingly.

Please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2/26/02.  I will review again on the 1st.  

Schedulers -  Please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [some contracts are based on calculations, especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage].

 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the 
comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our 
discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and 
the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will 
probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in 
the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The 
letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to 
the agreement.

I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is 
important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well 
as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to 
coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date.

Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change 
based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the 
loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in 
order to get the information you need.

Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached 
before next Wednesday if possible.  

Thank you.

Bill,

One suggestion.  In Section III, given the reference to all dockets in the related filing, the second sentence should be changed to read:
These applications seek, among other requests, to extend PG&E's existing intrastate. . . .

Thought you guys might find this chart pretty interesting.  USGT averages 
about 700,000 MMBtu per month, but as you can see it's highly variable.

Development of Sonoran Pipeline Project Halted

02/15/2002 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2002, PR Newswire) 
HOUSTON, Feb. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP) and Calpine Corporation (NYSE: CPN) today announced the termination of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline project. The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure sufficient binding commitments to make a successful project given market conditions. Securing firm transportation agreements was a stipulation that executives of both companies initially stated was necessary before development of the project could begin. Neither company has spent significant dollars on the proposed development of the pipeline and it was not expected to begin service until 2004. 
Both KMP and Calpine will continue to evaluate other opportunities to serve the growing California market. 
Phase I of the proposed Sonoran Pipeline would have extended from the Blanco Hub and terminated near Needles and Topock, Calif., with the possibility of a second phase extending into northern California. 
Based in San Jose, Calif., Calpine Corporation is an independent power company that is dedicated to providing customers with clean, efficient, natural gas-fired power generation. It generates and markets power, through plants it develops, owns and operates, in 29 states in the United States, three provinces in Canada and in the United Kingdom. Calpine also is the world's largest producer of renewable geothermal energy, and it owns 1.3 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas reserves in Canada and the United States. The company was founded in 1984 and is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CPN. For more information about Calpine, visit its website at www.calpine.com . 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L. P. is the nation's largest pipeline master limited partnership with an enterprise value of approximately $9 billion. KMP owns and operates more than 20,000 miles of pipelines and over 70 terminals. Its pipelines transport more than two million barrels per day of gasoline and other petroleum products and up to 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas. Its terminals handle over 50 million tons of coal and other bulk materials annually and have a liquids storage capacity of more than 53 million barrels for petroleum products and chemicals. KMP is also the leading provider in the U.S. of CO2, which is used in enhanced oil recovery projects.

Sounds like to me they will still be swinging and still in the test mode.  TW will work with Griffith as we can.

No matter how hard I try to get BVZ to include float in the schedule, to
allow for the "unknown things" which are bound to occur, they insist on the
most optimistic outcome and it never happens.

On Friday we will do the tests as detailed below.  After that there are
other tests which will take place before the plant goes commercial.

What seems to be the problem with start up.  When you do will you be in
more test phases or commercial.

   Subject:  Griffith Gas & Electric Estimate - Friday Sept. 14, HE 8:00 to
             Saturday Sept 15, HE 7:00

   This schedule is for performance testing as follows:

   1) Cold Start Test
        Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
        Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00

   2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
        Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.

   3) Operation at Minimum Load:
        Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00

   Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
   plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average
   MW
   shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
   Ingram of WAPA)

   Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then
   DETM
   can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.

Sheila--

Currently, the TW Market Team manually calculates the various prices associated with our negotiated rate deals at the end of every month.  Once the calculation is complete, the price is input into the billing system so customer invoices can be generated.  I have 3-4 people spending a full day every month end performing this rate calc for their deals (no two are exactly alike).

These calculations are all based on various published market indices.  As you evaluate the development and installation of the new contract billing system, is there a way we can automate this rate process?  Were it not for the manual labor process, the TW team would likely do more index-based negotitations.  

Please let me know your thoughts and timing.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt

Dennis:  Please remove the ROFR flag from 2 PG&E contracts,  25841 & 26511 per Paul Y'barbo.  In addition, amend the Red Rock expansion contract as indicated in red below.  PPL and Calpine now have their Red Rock expansion receipt volumes locked up in the West Texas area.  No more changes until the expansion is in service.

Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last 
posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but 
omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).

My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand 
how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As 
currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on 
use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our 
granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do 
intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted 
rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  

If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much 
of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.

Any questions -- give me a call.

S.

	Michelle:

	It was great to finally talk with you.  Here is some information on
the new power plants planned in the Bakersfield area.  This file is a couple
of years old and I quickly added in some of the latest information but some
of the information here is still quite outdated.  However, this document has
some rough diagrams of the area so you can see where the projects are
located.  The California Energy Commission has some information on their web
site about these projects as well.

	I'll talk to you soon.

Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying 
SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that 
TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to 
disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at 
the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we 
always do).  

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. 
Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of 
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Subject: Sierra Pacific Resources Announces Sale of Las Vegas Power Plant


  RENO, NEVADA, Dec. 11/PR Newswire/ -- Sierra
 Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP), parent company of Nevada
 Power Company and Sierra Pacific Power Company, today
 announced that Nevada Power Company has agreed to sell the
 Sunrise Station electric generating plant in Las Vegas,
 Nev., to Reliant Energy Power Generation, Inc., a
 subsidiary of Reliant Energy (NYSE: REI). The sale
 includes two generating units owned by Nevada Power and
 rights to electricity produced by three additional units
 on the Sunrise site owned by an independent power
 producer.

  The sale price of the generating station was $106
 million, subject to taxes and other adjustments at
 closing. In conjunction with the purchase, Nevada Power
 negotiated the right to buy energy and ancillary services
 from Reliant Energy Power Generation for agreed upon
 prices from closing until March 1, 2003, at a cost of $73
 million based on time of closing. This will result in a
 net price for the generating plant upon closing of
 approximately $33 million.

  "With the sale of Sunrise Station, divestiture of
 our generation assets is nearly complete. The buyer is a
 leader in power generation and has already established a
 strong presence in southern Nevada," said Walter M.
 Higgins, chairman, president and chief executive officer
 of Sierra Pacific Resources. "We'll soon be able to devote
 all our resources to building the best energy transmission
 and distribution company in the West."

  Sunrise Station consists of two generating units
 that can be fueled by natural gas or oil capable of
 producing up to 149 megawatts of electricity. The facility
 also includes three additional gas turbine generating
 units rated at 222 megawatts. These three units are owned
 by an independent power producer, Nevada Sun-Peak Limited
 Partnership, under contract to Nevada Power. All five of
 the units are located on a 38-acre site at the base of
 Frenchman Mountain near the eastern edge of Las Vegas.
 There are no regular full-time employees at Sunrise
 Station.

  Sale of the generating assets is a regulatory
 condition of the 1999 merger of Sierra Pacific Resources
 and Nevada Power. The sale is expected to close in
 mid-2001, subject to approval and review by various
 regulatory agencies.

  The company intends to complete the sale and
 transfer of all its generating assets in Nevada in 2001.

  Credit Suisse First Boston acted as financial
 advisor to Sierra Pacific Resources on the Sunrise Station
 sale. Navigant Consulting served as the technical advisor.

  Headquartered in Nevada, Sierra Pacific Resources
 is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are
 Nevada Power Company, the electric utility for southern
 Nevada; and Sierra Pacific Power Company, the electric
 utility for most of northern Nevada and the Lake Tahoe
 area of California, and a natural gas and water
 distributor in the Reno-Sparks area. Other subsidiaries
 include the Tuscarora Gas Pipeline Company, which owns 50
 percent interest in an interstate natural gas transmission
 partnership; and Sierra Pacific Communications, a
 telecommunications company.

  Reliant Energy and a partner jointly own and
 operate El Dorado Energy, a 480-megawatt, natural
 gas-fired facility southeast of Las Vegas. In October,
 Reliant Energy announced plans to construct a
 500-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plant about 20 miles
 north of Las Vegas, off Interstate 15.

  Based in Houston, Tex., Reliant Energy is an
 international energy services and energy delivery company
 with $20 billion in annual revenue and assets totaling $30
 billion. The company has a wholesale energy trading and
 marketing business that ranks among the top five in the
 U.S. in combined electricity and natural gas volumes and a
 presence in most of the major power regions of the U.S.
 The company has nearly 27,000 megawatts of power
 generation in operation in the U.S. and Western Europe and
 has announced acquisitions and development projects that
 will add another 4,000 megawatts.

tomorrow.  There is a slide about our new or proposed supply interconnects.  
Please send me an email with the capacity/volume and projected in-service (or 
if it's already in-service) for your project.  If I have the wrong people,

If you would like the tickets to take customers please let me know. First 
come first served. In case of a tie we will use a lottery system but you must 
notify me ahead  of time if you wish to witness the lottery (sound familiar?).

Bob
Dirk Ellison with EOG has contacted me twice this morning about the EFM at 
the location. He told me they planned to come on Tuesday evening. I have told 
him both times that we could not proceed until I receive word from you and 
Earl that all the agreements are in place. He had contacted Jerry Ball, who 
contacted their marketing, and their reply was to tell us (in the field) to 
proceed. I tried to explain that we needed that go-ahead from our folks, not 
theirs. Also, an issue came up on the operations conference call this morning 
about quality equipment - H2S, H2O, Sampler, Gas Chromatograph. The team had 
told Rich it was about a 20Mmcfd point, Dirk indicated to me they were 
looking at more like 16Mmcfd Commercial power is about a mile away from the 
location per the operations team and some of this equipment could require 
power.

We have got LOTS going on this week, could someone explain the situation to 
EOG?

Thanks
Mike

Subject: Re: EOG Pronghorn Location  

If we bare any expense, EOG is suppose to reimburse us, but getting money out 
of them is like pulling teeth.  

I suggest we complete the work at the site and have our facilities ready to 
proceed when necessary.  Marketing is not in a position right now to pay the 
cost of the EFM.  Given that these volumes will flow under a "pooling 
agreement", there isn't any incremental revenue generated for TW.

We will get with EOG to request payment for the EFM before we proceed.  Any 
idea how much the EFM will cost?

Glen, just hung up with Calpine. They have the Pastoria plant. Currently,
they have signed up for 100 mmcfd with Kern 03 capacity. However, their Las
Vegas plant may be able to take this capacity in which case they would be
open to alternatives. I believe SoCal is making a proposal to serve this
location as well. Mark, IGS.

Kim, 

There are some outstanding AR issues regarding ftps for Westar/KN/Oneok.  I've tried to contact them and talked to 4 different people with no avail.  The last person said he's not so sure that they are valid.  I've got to locate the contract and send to him.  I believe I'm going to need marketing assistance in collecting.  Can you tell me who I need to talk with.

Debbie

Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mei-Ling

Keep in mind that if we wait to see if the well is a producer, we have 
probably lost 2 weeks of the 4 week in-service that POGO has requested in 
their first conversations.  Since we have a pre-payment, I agree that the 
design and generation of a material list proceed.  Let me know if you hear 
anything contrary to what the field rep. has conveyed to Laura K.  Please fax 
the signed copy of the work order to Reggie, if you did not take care of it 
last Friday.  Have a great week!

EC,  I received a call from Richard Wright this afternoon and before he
proceeds with hiring an engineering company, et. al., he wants to make sure
that the well will produce.  So, that is on hold for a couple of weeks, it
sounds like.  However, he did say that they would want it installed
yesterday, basically, if it does produce.
 At any rate, I have requested ROW clearance from Cecil and sent the
environmental matrix to Butch s they can proceed with their part.

Capacity Marketing - TW completed two new long-term Index-to-Index 
transportation contracts this week.  Dynegy executed 35,000 MMBtu/d for 
calendar year 2003 from San Juan to the California Border and Calpine signed 
up for 14,000 MMBtu/d under similar terms.  In addition, Dynegy executed two 
short term Index-to-Index contracts; one month, 13,500 MMBtu/d for November 
2001, and 21,500 MMBtu/d for November - December 2002.   Both short term 
deals are from San Juan to California.  Hedges have been established on all 
the contracts to minimize TW's price exposure to the market indexes.

In addition, BP/Amoco purchased two packages of space at max rates on the 
Ignacio to Blanco route.  They purchased 55,000 MMBtu/d for calendar 2002 and 
20,000 MMBtu/d for 2003.   With the exception of a small package of Permian 
to Cal. border in November 2001, all available firm transportation flowing 
west has now been soldout on TW through the end of 2003.

Exxon/NALCO Enerflow -  Attended the Exxon presentation to operations this 
week on the proposed project to inject a drag reducing agent into several 
segments along TW's system.  Potential benefits include increasing our 
westward volume capacity by 5%, enhanced compressor efficiencies, and 
increased corrosion protection.  However, we are still waiting on the final 
results of the NNG Cunningham test segment.  Due to contamination issues on 
the mainline, we will likely begin by coating the 96 miles of San Juan 
lateral pipe sometime before the second quarter.

TransColorado - TC is evaluating outsourcing its entire back office 
operations (legal, regulatory, accounting, etc.) plus its marketing 
requirements to a third party provider.  ETS has prepared a draft 
qualification statement to be submitted by January 24.  TransColorado hopes 
to complete the transaction by late February.

Project McKinley  (Cal Border Peak Shaving) - Attended the marketing / 
operations meeting in Long Beach this week to discuss the potential of 
injecting natural gas liquids into TW's system to increase the Btu content of 
gas going into California.  This project has numerous logistic details to be 
worked not the least of which is where to site the injection point either 
upstream or downstream of Needles.  Other issues include railroad siding, NGL 
storage tanks, and possible contamination of downstream facilities.  A 
follow-up meeting is planned for the end of January.

Enron OnLine - TW marketing representatives attended Enron OnLine Training 
this week as we prepare to roll out capacity deals on the east end of TW's 
system.  The plan is to begin selling by February 1 three to five packages 
per day of 5,000 - 10,000 MMBtu/d.  As market demand picks up, we will expand 
the offerings.  

El Paso Field Services - the new interconnect with EPFS in Eddy County, NM is 
behind schedule.  We had previously committed to have TW's facilities 
finished by January 1, 2001.  On January 18, EPFS notified us that TW has 
quite a bit of work left to do before gas can flow.  (Among other things, the 
ROW has not yet been secured from the BLM in order for the electric poles to 
be installed).

As a follow-up to our meeting last Friday, I have reviewed the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement (CSA), SoCalGas System Adequacy proceeding testimony of Lad Lorenz and the CPUC Dec. 11, 2001 Decision on Unbundling the SoCalGas system by implementing the CSA with modifications.  I also have a call into Rodger Schwecke at SoCal to discuss their upcoming tariff filing and the related capacity issues.  Some of the pertinent points made in these documents relative to receipt point capacity and allocation are as follows:

Comprehensive Settlement Agreement

Appendix B outlines the details of backbone transmission/receipt point capacity rights:
	
1. All receipt points will be defined with firm capacity and primary access rights that reflect physical limitations.  The Appendix B table of receipt point capacity indicates that for No. Needles, Transwestern has Primary Access Rights of 750MMcf/d and Mojave at Hector Road has Secondary Access Rights.

2.  For interconnects into SoCalGas with more than one upstream pipeline, secondary access rights will be defined.

3.  New or expanded interconnects with existing or new pipelines will have secondary access rights only and will be subject to bumping by gas scheduled through primary access points.  

In the text of the CSA, the Open Season procedures for intrastate backbone transmission/receipt point capacity are described in detail.  Briefly, its proposed to work as follows:

1.  Initial Reservation for Core customers.  SoCalGas Acquisitions, core transport agents and wholesale customers serving the core will be provided a set aside amount of capacity.  This included 300MMcf/d at North Needles.

2.  First Stage/Phase I of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside.  Existing noncore customers may bid on any RP capacity up to 100% of their historical usage.

3.  Second Stage/Phase II of the Open Season for remainder of Phase I capacity, if any, not awarded or allocated.  Available to same existing noncore customers as in Phase I to bid on in this second round if they haven't been awarded capacity up to their 100% historical usage.

4.  Third Stage/Phase III of the Open Season for 50% of RP capacity after deducting core customer set aside plus any remaining capacity not awarded in Phases I and II.  Bidding open to any existing or new customers with creditworthiness established.

5.  SoCalGas will hold annual open seasons for expired or non-contracted available capacity.

6.  Market concentration limits were set such that no person or entity including affiliates may hold more than 40% of the capacity (after core set aside) at any one receipt point awarded through the open season process.  This does not include secondary market capacity or individually negotiated contracts acquired after the initial open season.

Examples of North Needles capacity:	Physical capacity	750 MMcf/d		Add'l 25/50	775/800
					Core Cust. set aside	300			Inc. core	313
					Avail. Cap. for bidding	450					462/487

					Phase I  avail. cap.	225					231/243.5

					Phase II avail. cap.	remainder of 225			remainder of
													231 or 243.5

					Phase III avail. cap. 	225 + remainder 			231/243.5 +
								of Phases I & II if any.			remainder of 
													Ph. I & II if any.

System Adequacy Proceeding--Lorenz Testimony

Lad Lorenz testifies that the proposal to allocate firm receipt point capacity on the SoCalGas system is intended to be used "until the commission acts in the GIR proceeding".  

In Section H. of Lad's testimony on Firm Receipt Point Access, Table II illustrates that North Needles will be expanded by 50MMcf/d to a level of 800.  In Table III under the heading of Firm Primary Access it states "TW--who then allocates among its shippers" in reference to the 800MMcf/d of capacity listed for North Needles.

In this same Section H, Lad states that this alternative proposal for allocating primary firm capacity at each receipt point will achieve improved reliability "until the Commission acts to approve the CSA".

CPUC Decision 01-12-018 on SoCalGas Unbundling

The Commission approved the CSA on Dec. 11, 2001 with certain modifications.  These modifications included:

1.  Market concentration limits were decreased from 40% to 30% and included capacity attained in subsequent open seasons or by individually negotiated contracts.  Secondary market capacity remains excluded from the market concentration limit.

2.  A secondary market price cap was established at 120% of the interruptible rate ($.07191).

3.  Reinstated the core reservation for intrastate capacity at 1044MMcf/d (CSA lowered it to 1000).  This explains why the core reservation for Needles is 313 and doesn't match the TW/SoCal contract level.  The additional 44 was allocated per a Calpine proposal on a prorata basis to each receipt point with Needles receiving an additional 13MMcf/d.

In the summary and conclusion sections of the Decision, SoCalGas was directed to include the additional 375MMcf/d of new backbone and receipt point capacity in its open season.  This part of the Order did not provide any direction as to how the new capacity was to be allocated to upstream pipelines.  Additionally SoCalGas was directed to file an advice letter for implementation and to include proposed methods for allocating any additional future capacity additions.

I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in 
the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that 
the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed 
to.   My concern with adding the language below is,  could it be argued that 
not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just 
stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different 
rate??

After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined 
language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other 
negotiated rate agreements we've done.  If there are any objections you need 
to get back to me ASAP.

Do you have Conoco's account?  We talked about this last week.  Did you say that you were working-on a termination letter on the three Conoco contracts and how their ROFR works with our notice of termination of the evergreen?  They are:

	20747	mainline	10,000/d	termination 2/28/02	month to month evergreen
	20748	mainline	10,000/d	termination 2/28/02	month to month evergreen
	20835	san juan	20,000/d	termination 2/28/02	year to year evergreen

They all can be terminated by either Party with 365 days notice prior to the end of the primary term.

Sorry, Michelle.? I was hoping to get you at least some type of bid,  but 
Tenaska is very closely reviewing where our investment dollars are going  
right now with everyone's credit being looked as so closely and with various  
storage and other projects that are currently requiring investment  dollars.? 
With that review, it was decided by our management since we are  not as well 
established in California as other areas, it would be best not to  send in 
any? bid at this time.?? If you have other opportunities,  please let me 
know.? I want to continue to build our presence on TW as the  situations

Team-- in my absence please submit additional bullets this week to Audrey by 
10:00 am Fri.  thanks

Main Line West Outage - West flow capacity has been reduced by approximately 
200,000 MMBtu/d for five days beginning 9/6 for pipeline testing.  To 
accommodate the market and customer needs, we have negotiated transport for 
50,000 MMBtu/day from PG&E to Needles for Max Rate of $.25 for the five day 
outage.  We also did a Market Center lend for 40,000 MMBtu/day @ $0.10.  
Estimated incremental revenue for the 5 day outage at this time is $82,500.  

KN/Oneok Contract -  We negotiated a 12 month max rate agreement with Oneok 
for 20,000 MMBtu/d of west flow capacity starting February 1, 2001.  We also 
negotiated in the contract a provision whereby if Oneok releases any of the 
capacity above the max rate, then TW shares 50/50 in the incremental 
revenue.  All executed documents have been received.

FERC / California Power Prices - The FERC plans to convene a public meeting 
the week of September 11 in California to take comments from interested 
parties regarding the recent price spikes of wholesale electricity and power 
transmission in the state.  In addition, SoCal Edison filed a motion late 
last week with the California Public Utility Commission seeking emergency 
relief from high spot gas prices on which its power purchase rates are based. 
The company told the CPUC that Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices 
in the last month have risen by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market 
manipulation, in particular the withholding off of the market of pipeline 
transportation capacity between the supply basins and the California border. 

"There is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential has 
been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, collusion 
and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and merchants," 
Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Jeff Dasovich from the Enron California office will attend the FERC meeting.

A couple of more things on Red Rock.  First, Shelley asked whether ENA part=
icipated in the open season.  If not, and if they are interested, or if Mav=
rix or any one else who didn't participate in the open season is interested=
, we ought to put something on the EBB that says "TW is now accepting bindi=
ng proposals for the capacity described in its ____, __ 2000 open season an=
d any shippers that didn't participate in that open season but who are inte=
rested in capacity should contact a TW marketing rep."  Or something like t=
hat.   Is there any problem with that?  Second, the Jeffs (Fawcett and Daso=
vich) and perhaps others will be talking to Danny shortly about a possible =
next phase expansion into California.  Someone please take point on passing=
 info from that meeting on to Shelley and MKM and me.  Shelley may want to =
have Stan tell Madden that we are looking at an additonal large expansion b=
eyond the one we are about to file.  The PR mileage might be useful but She=
lley will need to know as much as we can disclose outside about what we are=
 up to.  If we get serious about looking at something that goes beyond the =
Cal border we may want to hold that internally for a while and not tell Mad=
den.  On the other hand, I don't have any problem with Stan telling Madden =
that we have general concerns about whether pipe expansions within Californ=
ia will keep pace with interstate expansions to the border.  Jeff D's analo=
gy of the "four lane superhighway turning into a dirt road" is too good not=

After consulting with the commercial people and Bros. Fossum, Stojic and Ke=

ty.   Please let me know as soon as possible what you think of this. =20

Steps: =20

Marketers to contact shippers by phone and tell their contacts the followin=
g:

=09=09- bids will be accepted until 5:00, March 2
=09=09- we have a minimum NPV of $___ that must be met in order for the pro=
ject to be economic; bid accordingly
=09=09- Bids will be evaluated based on highest rate.
=09=09- Minimum term is 5 years.
=09=09- If there are tie bids that all qualify as highest rate and quantiti=
es bid upon exceed quantity available, the tie bids will be allocated pro r=
ata.
=09=09- Shippers should indicate whether they would be willing to have thei=
r bid capacity prorated in case an allocation is necessary.
=09=09- Bids should include:  1) service request and 2) offer letter statin=
g material terms (rate, term, points, quantity).  Offer is binding.  It can=
 include a regulatory "out," but cannot be "subject to management approval.=
"

The only shippers that will be contacted are those that responded to the No=
v. open season in a timely fashion.  (Drew, I found out this includes Calpi=
ne).

Explanation:

=09The commercial group decided (pending Steve Harris's approval) that they=
 prefer the "highest rate with a minimum stated term" over highest net pres=
ent value because it is consistent with Stan's stated preference for "front=
 loading" the contracts.  In other words, a shipper that bids $0.60 for 5 y=
ears beats a shipper that bids $0.35 for 15 years because it has bid the hi=
ghest rate.  =20

Questions? Comments?  Please reply soon.
Our marketers want to contact shippers tomorrow.  Competing pipelines are a=
lready out soliciting bids for their expansions...

 Natural Gas Intellingence, Wednesday, December 6, 2000

Transwestern Adds Receipt and Delivery Points
Transwestern Pipeline is going through a growth spurt with eight new 
interconnect projects in service or under way, which will add 300 MMcf/d in 
market area deliveries and 285 MMcf/d in new supply receipts. The new or 
expanded connection points will enhance shipper access to both new supplies 
and markets. 
"There is not a direct relationship between the two [delivery and receipt 
interconnects]," said Jeff Fawcett, a Transwestern representative. "It is 
kind of coincidental in nature that they came at the same time, but we have 
ongoing activities to connect new supply and create additional opportunities 
for gas to both be received into Transwestern as well as be delivered out of 
Transwestern." 
Included in the delivery interconnect projects, Transwestern, an Enron unit, 
recently put 100 MMcf/d into service for new access to markets around Las 
Vegas with completion of the Southwest Gas interconnect located in the West 
of Thoreau area. 
Two other delivery interconnects are expected to be in service during the 
second quarter of 2001. Transwestern will add a 120 MMcf/d delivery 
interconnect with Citizens Arizona Gas for deliveries to the Griffith Energy 
Power Plant and a 90 MMcf/d delivery interconnect to a soon to be completed 
Calpine plant, both located near Kingman in the West of Thoreau area. 
On the supply side, Transwestern recently has added an 80 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect in the East of Thoreau area with Natural Gas Pipeline Co. The 
company also said that it has hooked up a new wellhead supply interconnect 
with Enron Oil & Gas located in the East of Thoreau area. The addition will 
bump current supply from 20 MMcf/d to more than 35 MMcf/d. 
Transwestern also has three receipt projects scheduled for completion early 
next year. The pipeline said it expects to increase receipt capacity by 100 
MMcf/d at its interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering south of La Plata in the 
San Juan area later this month, and to put a new 50 MMcf/d receipt 
interconnect with Red Cedar Gathering in service by March 2001. The company 
also is planning to complete a new 40 MMcf/d receipt interconnect with El 
Paso Field Services in East of Thoreau which is scheduled to be in service 
January 2001. 
Transwestern Pipeline's system consists of approximately 2,700 miles of 
natural gas pipeline with combined east-west delivery capability of 1.7 
Bcf/day. For further information on transportation with Transwestern Pipeline 
Co., contact Fawcett at 713-853-1521.

The contract is set up (CR27698).  I just need to know what volumes to put in so I can submit it to CAS.

Subject:	Red Rock Admin Contract

I have run across an issue with the Admin contract.

Don't worry, the overall solution is still good!  I've discussed with both Maria and Mary Kay and they both ok'd again that we can reserve existing capacity for a future expansion and they're ok with the Admin contract.

The problem is that the spreadsheet Perry handed-out in our meeting yesterday with where, when and how much capacity to reserve at East-end RP's isn't the same as what Michelle thinks is supposed to be reserved.  I've been unable to get with Perry yet today to talk with him.  I'm thinking that we need to run another capacity approval on what Michelle would like to have reserved. 

Perry's message says he is out today.  I'm not sure when he will be back.  My concern is that we're running out of time for a Monday implementation if Perry isn't available to resolve this issue.  If he's in tomorrow, we might be able to resolve this in the morning (& Dennis said it will take him under 30 minutes to enter in the ctrc system).  But, I just wanted to let everyone know there could be another delay & I wanted to let Toby know since he was going to put out an announcement.

I'll update you on the status of this issue tomorrow.

The Commission issued a draft order in Docket No. RP00-249 today accepting 
TW's tariff sheets to acquire offsystem capacity on PNM, effective Sept. 15, 
subject to the following conditions:

The tariff sheets are accepted for a 2-year period subject to TW's refiling 
within 15 days of the order to 1) limit its acquisition to a max. of 40,000 
MMBtu/day and 2) to limit the firm service to the non-peak summer period.  
Also, TW must file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2-year 
period detailing what impact, if any, the proposal has had on the market.  
After the report is filed, parties may comment on the report.

We agreed to the 40,000 MMBtu limit but not to the non-peak period or the 
20-year limit.  Let's discuss whether we should seek rehearing of the order.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

This looks good from the Commercial side.  I am assuming that when a customer uses the "View Printable Page," that printout header cannot be frozen.  Otherwise, this is what we are looking for as far as viewing this spreadsheet on line.  When the formatting issues are resolved, I recommend we move this to production.  Thanks.

I added an extra "Printable Page" button on the page so that the entire page can be printed out.
Michelle, please let me know if you still have problems to get to the TW Unsubscribed Capacity page. Sorry about the delay.

Thanks.

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

Please go to http://twdev.ets.enron.com our testing site to view the modified TW Unsubscribed Capacity web page and see if this is what you guys want. I removed the borders because the table header and  records page are in the different frames, it is very hard to adjust them exactly straight into the same columns.

Thanks!

We have finalized negotiations with Oneok Westex on the new 200,000 MMBtu/d interconnect with TW in Ward County, TX.  The final agreement has been emailed to them for their signature.  TW's costs are approximately $28,000 including the gross up for tax purposes which is fully reimbursable from Oneok.  The meter is a high-capacity ultrasonic meter which will take gas from the Oneok Red River system and deliver it into TW south of WT-2.  The POI is #78161.  Oneok says they are ready to flow; I have not heard yet from our field whether or not TW is ready.

Let me know if you have questions.

At the meeting yesterday, SoCalGas outlined their plan for implementing the unbundling of their backbone system including a proposed timeline which will be filed at the CPUC on Jan. 17, 2002.  Lad Lorenz state that the proposal is "not cast in concrete" and invited comments at the meeting as well as in response to the filing.  However as you might expect, when some customers expressed their concern with the timeline being too short, SoCal made no offer to push some of the dates out into the future and stuck with their proposal.  All of the proposed dates are their best estimate for timing as variables such as the system requirements may cause delays and rescheduling of some portions of the implementation plan.  Key items and dates are as follows:

Jan. 17		SoCalGas files its proposed Implementation Plan and timeline.

Feb. 14		Meeting with CPUC Energy Staff and Interested Parties.  Tariff Workshop.

Feb. 22		SoCalGas files tariffs including a definition of Annual Average Usage for existing end-use customers.
		This definition is important as it determines their capacity rights in the Open Season.	

Mar. 15		50 mmcf/d of capacity at North Needles to be placed into service.

May 6		Distribution of informational packages on Backbone Receipt Point Rights to customers.

May 29		Begin Phase I of the Open Season.

June 5		Phase I Open Season ends.  See Slides 55 through 57 for all other Open Season dates.

June 22		SoCal will post awarded receipt point capacity.

July 1		Implementation of unbundling the backbone receipt point services.

Slide 13		Indicates North Needles has 800 mmcf/d of capacity
		This was described as "primarily Transwestern"

Slide 15		The Core backbone receipt point capacity at Needles is set at 313 mmcf/d.

I'm faxing an entire copy of the presentation to Marketing and Regulatory Affairs for distribution and review.  Slides 11-21 describe the Backbone Receipt Services and Slides 50-63 provide the proposed timeline for implementation.  Please give me a call if you have any questions about SoCal's proposal.  gh

Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the 
Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the 
summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to 
consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of 
our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're 
doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our 
request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda.

I do not see any problems with the draft tariff sheets. My concerns are how 
to implement this new service. We need to start meeting with 
marketing/legal/regulatory to determine how we will implement this & define 
the system requirements. Here are some of my questions:

If we recall & the nomination is still in place, then how do we allocate? 
What are the allocation rules?
How do we track the volumes/contracts that have been recalled? Who will 
monitor this process? What type of process is needed to track recalls & 
transporter call volumes?
What is the timing for the recall notice? Can it occur after the gas day has 
started? Will we have partial day recalls?
Will the recall option & transporter put option carry over to the aquiring 
shipper? What system changes are needed for capacity release?
How do we require a shipper to take firm transport capacity? Will this have 
some type of OFO notice similar to EFBH that requires the shipper to nominate?
How will the invoice system be changed to handle the various option fee 
processes? Will we store this information at a contract level in CBS or in 
the rate system at a contract level? Who will load & monitor these fee 
options?
Do we need a new Rate Schedule?

Lindy, can you let me know when you are availble to start meeting on this new 
service so that I can create our system requirements document. I am availble 
July 24th, 25th, & 26th.

Please let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Yesterday in our meeting regarding Red Rock and future expansions Eric stated the current capacity through Station 8 is between 590,000 - 600,000 MMBtu/d.  Contractually, Transwestern currently has 599,500 MMBtu of firm transportation pathed through Station 8.  

SoCal Gas' FT allows for 200,000 MMBtu of firm receipts in San Juan and 306,000 MMBtu of firm receipts EOT.  Typically, SoCal baseloads the 200,000 MMBtu each day from the San Juan, so historical use of EOT receipts has not exceeded 106,000 MMBtu.  

Eric - If the San Juan Lateral was to go partially or totally down and Socal nominated its 306,000 MMBtu of EOT receipts, given our current contractual obligations pathed through Station 8 and the 150,000 MMBtu Red Rock capacity, would the lower pressure at the junction allow us to move up to 750,000 MMBtu/d from EOT?

Conoco is asking to interconnect with TW to deliver gas to us on the Monument lateral.  Initially, they would like to flow 15-20mm day @ 650#.  The likely I/C point would be downstream of the Monument compressor station at Range 35 E, Town 20 S, Section 26 where the Llano line crosses our Monument line.  

Mansoor, I know you're looking at another I/C for Michelle Lokay for a different company.  Based on the above info, what is the max volume Conoco could flow?

thanks
Kevin Hyatt

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.  

Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.

Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.  

As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Questions or concerns????

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

AGI Consulting will be conducting the Team Development Training at the Del Lago Resort and Conference Center on Tuesday, April 3rd and Wednesday, April 4th.  

As stated in your Training Plan Agenda, the program will commence at 8:00am on Tuesday morning and end at 4:45pm on Wednesday afternoon.  A block of rooms has been reserved for Tuesday night only.  Because this site is located on the north side of town, some of you may have difficulty arriving by 8:00a.  This being the fact, Steve has graciously offered to finance accommodations for a Monday night stay as well.  If you would like for me to reserve an extra night for you,  please call me by Monday, March 26.

Driving directions are noted below:

		Take I-45 North, exit Number 87, towards Conroe (TX-105)
		Turn Slight Left onto TX-105
		(Approximately 60 miles from downtown)

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

In our negotiated rate proceeding, the Commission issued a Section 5 "show cause" order.  Specifically, TW must, within 10 days of the order, show cause why its actions in offering the negotiated rate contracts (Reliant, Richardson, BP, Sempra, Astra) was not in contravention of Commission policy.  TW must explain the availability of firm capacity on TW's system, and how it has the firm capacity to move gas under the transactions under investigation, yet provide recourse service without interruption.  Drew, Maria and I will work with outside counsel to file the necessary pleading.  I'll get a copy of the order to each of you.

In other news, in CPUC v. El Paso, the Commission issued an order discussing CPUC's complaint that El Paso Merchant intentionally acquired more capacity than needed to manipulate price spreads. The order dismisses denies summary judgment and dismisses the complaint. FERC stated that El Paso Merchant has not violated any standards of conduct. With respect to the issue of market power, the current record is not considered to be complete. However, FERC will schedule a hearing to complete and review the record.

I have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of 
the market dynamics affecting the Needles to Topock price differentials.  
Each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of Topock gas 
supplies, rather than the incremental intra-state transport costs required to 
transport to the PG&E citygate, as the primary driving force for the Needles 
to Topock  price differential.    

Here is a recurring theme I heard from my customers:  The El Paso Merchant 
Service (EPMS) 1.2 BCF contract's Block II capacity (500 MMcf/d of Permian to 
PG&E/Topock capacity,  $.065 transport rate) has a re-callable aspect.  If 
EPMS schedules gas under the transport of Block II capacity to any other 
California delivery point other than PG&E/Topock, then other parties may 
recall the capacity for their own use to PG&E/Topock.  Currently Duke has 
recalled 100 MMcf/d and PG&E Energy Trading has also recalled 100 MMcf/d for 
their use to transport Permian gas to PG&E/Topock. (FYI - EPMC may re-recall 
this capacity, but they have elected not to).  These additional Topock 
supplies coming from Duke and PG&E Energy Trading under Block II capacity may 
be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to PG&E at Topock.  This gas 
competes head to head with Malin gas prices.  For example, today's Malin 
price is $4.62 while PG&E/Topock price is $4.69.    Today's cash price 
differential between Needles and Topock is $.60, far larger than the 
previously assumed $.28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost 
required to bring Topock gas to the citygate.    

If anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these 
market dynamics, let's discuss further at our next staff meeting. CS

The file sent out yesterday had several inconsistencies that were brought to 
my attention by Cynthia and Terry. 
The corrected billing is attached. I regret any inconvenience this may have 
caused.


Please note: 
A changed from previous billing file... USGT was charged 3 cents/d for stored 
quantities(The quantities stored from 7/25 -7/31 did not trigger the tiered 
rates). 
The daily rate was suspended  for gas day 7/01 thru 7/09 for both Duke Energy 
and Sempra due to the station 4 compressor outage.  Invoice amounts for these 
shippers reflect this adjustment.
Reliant (PO 27060) carryover quantity of 1,514 MMBtu from previous month - 
$1,362.60 (This qty remains from April business)
Sempra (PO 27255) carryover quantity of 6,000 MMBtu from previous mpnth - 
$5220.00 ( This qty was parked in June)

If you have any questions, please call me at  x36486.

Mike,

Boy, the more things change, the more they stay the same.... 

 You are correct that EOG does not give us the OK to "go ahead".  

EOG has agreed to wire funds to TW today to cover the cost of installing the 
EFM, quality monitoring equipment, and whatever additional cost we incurred.  
In typical EOG fashion however, they want everything done yesterday, after 
their actions delayed the activity by over a week.  To the extent we have the 
equipment available, and can install it, they would like to flow the gas as 
soon as possible.  Is it possible to hook up their well pending our securing 
all the equipment we need, or is the gas too bad to risk it?  They have gone 
ahead and told our Market Services people they are delivering the gas for 
tomorrow's gas day, and I suspect that is a little aggressive.  Do you have 
an idea when the gas will be available?

Thanks for your help, Bob

Michelle

I found another file where I have already detailed the measured and scheduled volumes through Feb 200. It wouldn't take that long to finish this spreadsheet if needed.
I will send it to you if you want it.

I will try to find an accountant type at El Paso to determine what volume they have

Capacity Marketing
PG&E Trading has re-aligned several transport contracts including a pre-arranged capacity release deal with Texaco for June - October.  PG&E sold 50,000 MMBtu/d of Topock delivery capacity at index formula-based rates.  However, Texaco is not utilizing Topock; they have chosen to re-deliver the gas to Citizens, east of the Cal border. 
 
Short Term April Capacity Deals

 
 
El Paso Field Services - EPFS would like to deliver another 50,000 MMBtu/d to TW's West Texas lateral as early as May 1 through the new Eddy County, NM interconnect.  TW informed them that at this point we will decline to share in the cost of expanding the interconnect.
 
Agave - Agave and Duke have for regulatory reasons chosen not take gas off the LEC 10" and redeliver to the Crawford lateral.  Their counsel informs them they stand the risk of making their gathering systems FERC jurisdictional pipelines.
 
NGPL - Met with business development reps this week to discuss the various interconnects between NGPL and TW's east system.  NGPL is conducting an open season on expanding the takeaway capacity on their line from the Marathon Indian Basin plant.  NGPL needs to add 6,000 hp of mainline compression plus a 1,000 hp booster compressor to access TW's high pressure system.  This additional horsepower would only bring an estimated 42,000 MMBtu/d incremental to TW.  Based on the cost, NGPL has proposed TW paying for the booster compressor.  Facility Planning is evaluating this cost plus possibly sizing a larger booster to see if we can gain additional throughput capability on the West Texas lateral.
 
FERC Negotiated Rate Filings - In our negotiated rate proceeding, the Commission issued a Section 5 "show cause" order.  TW must, within 10 days of the order, show cause why its actions in offering the negotiated rate contracts (Reliant, Richardson, BP, Sempra, Astra) were not in contravention of Commission policy.  TW must explain the availability of firm capacity on TW's system, and how it has the firm capacity to move gas under the transactions under investigation, yet provide recourse service without interruption.  
 
Red Rock Expansion - The project documentation was filed at FERC on Thursday March 29.
 
Caithness - The project developers for the Big Sandy generation project near Wickieup, AZ informed us this week they would like a budget quality cost estimate for tying the power plant exclusively to TW.  Caithness will install the approximately 40 miles of line to reach TW.  They projected in-service date for the plant is August 2003.  Phase 1 will consume 80,000 MMBtu/d, phase 2 will take an incremental 40,000 MMBtu/d.

Lorrian and Michel,

The Rofr option, which grants the shipper the right to lock in the 
transportation rate (max rate) for next
a few years, is priced as a spread swaption. 

I priced two scenarios for you:  the strip starts 1) Nov.1-00 and 2)Nov. 1-01.
For the first one I assume that the shipper makes decision on Oct. 31,00 (54 
days  to maturity)
and  on Oct. 31,01(419 days to maturity)  for the second case.

The second case has longer time to expiration, therefore larger option time 
value. See the attached
spreadsheets for more detail.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

Re paragraph 8:  I just spoke with Mary Kay and Drew.  Because of FERC policy 
on negotiated rates, we have to be careful to characterize paragraph 8 as a 
bid evaluation method only.  Just because a shipper hits the max rate button 
does not mean they are committing to 100% throughput.  In order to commit to 
100% throughput, they need to submit a 2-part bid and indicate 100% 
throughput.  Does this make sense?  Let me know if there are any problems.

Subject: Toy Closet

Okay, it's done!!!!  :)    :)

All of our gifts have been neatly, and I emphasize, NEATLY, arranged in our 
toy closet.  I have attached a logout sheet for your review only.  I have a 
sample sign off in red.  

I would like for everyone to sign off on each item you take and leave the 
remaining number for the next person to quickly access the gifts.

I expect all of you to keep our closet CLEAN and CLUTTER FREE :)

If you take the last item, let me know.  If you feel we should order more 
gifts, see Kevin :)

Should you have any additional questions, please see me.  

By the way, you all are familiar with where I keep the keys in the event I'm 
not available.

Thanks for your attention and cooperation.

You all are soooo great!!!!

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

If you're ordering from Corporate Express, this might help you.   Weekly 
#AAG21952, Monthly #AAG21904.  I couldn't tell from the picture if they were 
blue, though.  Can you verify?

Here is another matrix of TW "Current Shipper" rates & surcharges.
This one is not posted on the web.
I don't know whether anyone needs/uses it, anymore, but I have been keeping it up.
There is a new tab for each change in Current Shipper Rates.
The latest is "200111"

Elizabeth - I forgot to send this to you this morning.  
Jeanette - I don't recall whether I sent this along with the other TW files.

Below is a link to the Proposed Decision by  Com. Bilas on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding that has been lingering on the agenda for most of the year.  This was just issued late last week and published today.  I'm still in the process of reviewing it but the good news is that he is proposing the adoption of the Comprehensive Settlement which Transwestern helped design and supported along with most other participants.  The decision does however make some modifications which may not be in our best interest i.e. the adoption of a price cap for secondary market transactions.  Due to the lapse in time on this proceeding, Com. Bilas has granted participants the right to file comments by Friday, October 19, 2001.  Please review and advise if you agree we should file comments (I also have a call into Mark Baldwin).  Note this is 140+ pages--you may wish to review the summary and pertinent sections.

Attached is the September 2000 billing for park n ride.

Please note: 
USGT (PO 27268) carried over into September a balance of 7,247 at $0.03 per 
day and that quantity remains on USGT's account. This results in an effective 
rate of $0.2454 per Dth. 
Sempra (PO 27255) held a carryover park quantity of 6,000 MMBtu from a 
previous month that was finally balanced on September 8th.

Met with Lee Hart.  Reliant is interested in bidding for the capacity being 
auctioned on EnronOnLine, but will probably not respond until Monday.  
Reliant is also interested in the concept of fuel monetization and will 
definitely work with us to give shipper's perspective.

Attended meeting with Conoco (Carla Johnson and Mary Ann Pearce) and Steve 
Harris, Rockey Storie to discuss potential settlement of Northern Natural 
take or pay case.

Introduced myself to Cathy Bulf of Oneok (KN).  They are also interested in 
the auctioned capacity.

Please find attached a letter from Lad and Pat of Socal.  TW was requested by Socal to reallocate the Needles "window" on intraday 1 cycle last Friday.  Socal lowered the "window" below TW's firm requirements.  This has not been the policy previously followed by the two companies.  Once the Socal "window" was established on the timely cycle, the window would not change for that gas day.  I did not want to cut TW's FT shippers late on Friday.  I wanted time to alert them that this policy was changing and they could not rely on getting the same allocation of gas at Needles during each daily cycle.

Lynn and I talked with Pat Davidson and TW has agreed to accomodate any changes (increases or decreases) to the "window" during a particular gas day except for the intraday 2 cycle. Lynn and I told Pat that changing the allocation during intraday 2 cycle would create imbalances on TW's system, and TW was not allowed to have shipper imbalances per its tariff.

Lynn has prepared an EBB posting alerting our shippers of this change.  It will be posted today and the policy will go into affect for Friday's gas day.

Any questions, please call Mrs. Blair!

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Capacity Marketing - Conoco was awarded the 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity from San Juan to Needles at max rates for five years and one month beginning 3/1/02.  Demand charges for the term total $14mm.  

Despite the ongoing system maintenance that began this week, gas control has steadily been able to increase TW's west flow from the projected 800,000 MMBtu/d to 900,000 by week's end.  We have also been able to schedule IT deliveries at max rates from Topock to Needles.  This slight increase will help us make up for the greater decrease in volume due to DOT mandated reduced operating pressures when the safety dig-outs commence in early May.  For the period May 8-12, our projected flow of 800,000 MMBtu/d to the border will be reduced to 705,000.

Atoka Lateral Test - We have been working with Agave Petroleum to reconfigure some gas flow as it moves through the Atoka 3 station on the lateral.  Agave is moving approximately 15,000 MMBtu/d of its high pressure gas onto the LEC 10" lateral from the Atoka low pressure line.  The TW Artesia Team moved one A3 compressor from Atoka to the LEC line.  The first test day was Thursday 4/5; the test will run for one week.  If the test works to everyone's satisfaction, we will need to install an additional H2s monitor at A3.  The net benefit to TW of the test will likely be minimal but may allow Agave to better utilize its compression and plant resources around the Atoka system.

ONEOK Westar - We have been working with ONEOK to enable them to make the existing Ward County, TX delivery point a high-volume bi-directional point.  They have installed approximately 1500' of pipe from their Red River system over to the south end (below WT-2) of TW's West Texas lateral.  The ultrasonic meter will be capable of flowing 200,000 MMBtu/d into TW's high pressure line.  ONEOK expects to flow on average 80,000 MMBtu/d.  This volume, by displacement, should free up some WT-2 and WT-1 compressor capacity for gas flowing to Texas intrastate lines; in-service date is expected to be June 1, 2001.

Per our Transwestern transportation agreement, North Start Steel would
line to change our delivery point from PG&E Topock - (POI 56698) on the
Transwestern Pipeline to CPN South Point (POI 78113) for 1,300 mmbtu
per day deliveries on or about May 7, 2001 or sooner or later, as
soonest this point becomes operational. This change will remain in
effect through May 31, 2002 gas day, which is the duration of the
transportation contract.

New Xcel Energy Combination Completed

Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern 
States Power 
and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine 
under the new 
name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity 
and natural gas 
companies in the United States. 

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger, 
wrapping up approvals 
from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel 
Energy will serve more 
than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12 
states, and 2 million electricity 
customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis. 
Gradually, the NSP and NCE 
names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and 
services in 12 states, 
including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas, 
Oklahoma, Arizona, New 
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming. 

Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the 
symbol XEL. Current 
New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy 
stock for each share of 
NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required 
to exchange their existing 
NSP stock. 

The merger proposal was announced March 25, 1999, and completed in less than 
a year and a half. 
"This has been an incredibly successful merger process," said Jim Howard, 
Xcel chairman. "It demonstrates 
what can be accomplished when regulators, environmentalists, community 
leaders and the merger partners 
all work in a common direction --- to create a better utility company for the 
future." 

"Our strength will come from a base of millions of customers spread over a 
large area, combined with our 
rapidly growing non-regulated businesses like NRG Energy, now the seventh 
largest independent power 
producer in the world, " said Wayne Brunetti, Xcel president.

Subject:	Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG"- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

Glen, I thought I pass this tidbit of information on to you and the Enron
team. I was speaking to a PG&E manager yesterday attempting to get an update
of where PG&E thinks it stands on it open season application. Bottom line
this individual had just received word a few minutes before that
Commissioner Bilas was writing a Proposed Decision that would "deny" PG&E's
application. Therefore, PG&E's open season would be closed down. I will
follow up next week.

On another important initiative, PG&E's Gas Accord II, apparently PG&E's
long awaited application is still hung up with the bankruptcy attorneys.
Given their Chapter 11 status, I am sure that their application which
includes spending hundreds of millions of dollars for system upgrades
requires review and preliminary approval from the bankruptcy attorneys and
eventually the judge. I will keep you posted.
Mark Baldwin, IGS.

Subject:	SoCal RLS/Peaking Tariff

In the CPUC's meeting today, the Commission approved the proposed RLS/Peaking tariff which provides for a bypass peaking rate when customers bypass their system except for peaking service.  It appears they approved the June 19th Proposed Decision which establishes a cost based rate made up of four components--Customer Charge, Public Purpose Program charge, Reservation Charge and a volumetric Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge.  As soon as the Order is published I'll review the final Order and advise if this is still true or if any changes were made.  SoCal will have 10 days from the Order to file an Advice Letter with conforming tariff sheets.

Jerry here's the items that we need to address in our meeting Friday, July 20th at Transwestern's WT-1 compressor station starting at 09:00 New Mexico time. 
If you have anything to add please do and send back to me. I look forward to seeing you again. As you know Transwestern was asked to buy the material and do the project for EOG. After saying this so you will know Transwestern ordered the material and most of it is in our warehouse in Roswell so we'll need to talk about this.  I didn't know about the material when you and I talked yesterday morning.

Material's that will be needed at the location to monitor and operate the facility. 

1.  Chromagraph
2.  H2O Monitor
3. H2s Monitor
4. EFM
5. Flow Control
6. Positive Shut In 
7. Flow Bypass
8. Power to facility

People that will be attending from Transwestern, Rich Jolly, Earl Chanley, Laura Kunkel (maybe), and the some of the Carlsbad team members.

Thanks for working with us on this.
Rich

Currently, TW isolates a portion of the Panhandle lateral to force production received into the pipe downstream of the P-3 compressor station to physically flow north east, to a interconnect with Northern.  The POI's downstream of this block valve are removed from the IT template to avoid that an "all points" contract is tendered. This would allow the scheduling system to accept a nomination from these particular points to an "upstream" point, and we currently prohibit this.  

Historically, this gas was isolated to assure it flowed to an interconnect that would deliver into a process gas stream on Northern's mainline, for ultimate processing at Bushton or CMS's Beaver plant.  When shippers have requested that this gas be scheduled to markets other than NNG, (i.e. California or Waha) they were told it could not deviate from this predetermined path.

CMS has indicated they will no longer flow this gas to TW starting in March (volume is from 15,000 to 20,000 mmbut/d at an $0.08 rate), and will instead seek a pipeline that will allow them access to the West Texas and California markets.  Once this gas is diverted from our pipe it will not return.  

My questions are:

Darrell: Is there an operational reason why this gas can not flow south on the Panhandle lateral?  Is there a quality issue?  I recall the gas was diverted to NNG for the benefit OneOk and the Buston plant.  The asset sale we anticipated with KN never   materialized, and thus our attempt to load the buston plant from these facilities is not going to benefit us. 

Susan/Lee:  Can TW discriminate service if there is not a gas quality issue that would otherwise shut the gas in as unmerchantable?  We receive gas South of the block valve and it is able to flow on the Panhandle lateral to Waha and California markets.  The fact that this gas is downstream of a valve we closed for the convenience and benefit of NNG and OneOk is the only reason it can not flow to other points on TW.  Is this a supportable position if a shipper elected to challenge it?

Steve:  Do you think OneOk still expects this valve to be closed?  Would they object if it was opened?  If this gas goes to El Paso, it would be lost for processing by OneOk anyway.

Could we get together sometime Monday AM between 8:30 and 9:30 to discuss this?

Thanks, Bob

I talked to the Carlsbad team yesterday, they are planning to relocate the 
equipment beginning today. Possible we will utilize space on EOG's antenna 
tower for solar panel, radio box, and antenna. EOG measurement was going to 
contact Benny Netherlin.

Rich had also sent them a request for input as to what additional quality 
equipment was needed at the location. That will be passed to Earl and Bob to 
develop additional estimates.

Subject: Re: EOG Pronghorn Location  

Mike,

Boy, the more things change, the more they stay the same.... 

 You are correct that EOG does not give us the OK to "go ahead".  

EOG has agreed to wire funds to TW today to cover the cost of installing the 
EFM, quality monitoring equipment, and whatever additional cost we incurred.  
In typical EOG fashion however, they want everything done yesterday, after 
their actions delayed the activity by over a week.  To the extent we have the 
equipment available, and can install it, they would like to flow the gas as 
soon as possible.  Is it possible to hook up their well pending our securing 
all the equipment we need, or is the gas too bad to risk it?  They have gone 
ahead and told our Market Services people they are delivering the gas for 
tomorrow's gas day, and I suspect that is a little aggressive.  Do you have 
an idea when the gas will be available?

Thanks for your help, Bob

I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your 
question, as well as the questions raised in Drew's e-mail.  Here's what we 
found out...

Steve's question:

What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New 
Mexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us 
expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?

What you're really asking here is "What are the comparative economics of 
energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?"  In this 
analysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to 
construct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including 
energy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations. 

 Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines 
and tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct 
turnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile "rule of thumb" we use 
for turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36") high-pressure steel 
pipeline.  

In terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are 
three (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1) 
transformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the 
conductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This 
number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on 
Transwestern's pipeline.   

The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission 
lines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission 
lines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an 
electric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could 
take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of 
electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along 
with other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in 
securing permits for right-of-way.

In short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be 
comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and 
electric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric 
transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate 
returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.


Drew's questions:

1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts 
his plant?

For purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired 
generation.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding 
where to site a new electric power plant:
 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market
 2. Water rights for turbine cooling
 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local 
regulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)
 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure  


2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over?

FERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of 
conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and 
between other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.  
FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission 
access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate 
their transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant 
functions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under 
FERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's 
pretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with 
respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual 
states, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of 
Independent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for 
improvement (and possible further FERC involvement).
 
"In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a 
single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of 
service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission 
service.  All public utilities that own, control, or operate interstate 
transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro 
forma tariff.  They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own 
wholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the 
full recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred 
to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use 
open access to move to another supplier."  


3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc. 
separately)?

In my experience, there is no "one size fits all" formula or strategy.  For 
example, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to 
supplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out 
of several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground 
and dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged 
the gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the 
purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western 
U.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders 
are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation 
to the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/ 
transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics 
and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas 
supply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala 
Calpine.


4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?

Last December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional 
Transmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of 
Orders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker, 
Order 2000 makes "a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations 
from the influence of electricity market participants."  Therefore, Order 
2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the 
functional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization 
of the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional 
boundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of 
privately-owned transmission companies.  

FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order 
initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The 
Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned "public 
utilities" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private 
utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate 
the needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally 
owned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer 
the following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused 
by structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in 
transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion 
management, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities 
for discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase 
coordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8) 
facilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate 
lighter-handed regulation. 

Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO 
formation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers 
for case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved 
in order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel 
any transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance 
and incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of 
further consequences for the hold-outs. 

As to the final part of the question ("why should we care?"), presumably, the 
development of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the 
efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As 
FERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and 
utility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission 
system.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and 
the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately, 
sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately 
cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.  


5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?

Natural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only "kill" gas-fired power plants in 
those instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural 
gas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side 
management or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly 
prohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace, 
particularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel 
for electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than 
5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give 
fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu 
price).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make 
the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than 
natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand 
side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting 
resource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in 
offsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable 
to comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the 
use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.

Since you are the "expert" in this area, I need to know what economics would 
determine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico (maybe 
3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to 
deliver the gas to a power plant in California. If you could let me know by 
next Friday I would appreciate it.

When we originally decided to use my staff meetings for "graduate education" 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry.  We all had a first lesson 
on this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and 
Kevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent 
developments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power 
generation load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the 
following:
1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer 
puts his plant?  
2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over? 
3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  
separately)?
4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? 
5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?
 Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a 
follow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.

Operations is digging out 2000 feet of pipe to begin the hydro test today or 
thursday.  If the test results are good, they'll recoat the pipe and put it 
back in service.  We could be at 80% volume on Friday afternoon, but this is 
tentative.  

Also, the smart pig test run several months ago identified 4 potential areas 
that need inspections west of station 5.  While east of thoreau is down, 
these 4 areas will also be inspected.

Do not pass this info onto customers at this point till we have further 
information.  We will make a posting hopefully this afternoon.  Operations is 
also trying to combine some additional compressor work to this outage (i.e. 
grouting another unit and replacing some valves).  This work will limit our 
west deliveries to 875,000.  This notice will also be posted shortly.

see me if you have questions

Southwest Gas - SWG informed us this week they will most likely not be ready 
to receive gas from TW by the projected November 1 in-service date; the new 
date will probably be mid-month.  We will still invoice SWG for 
transportation under their firm contract beginning Nov. 1.  Also, upon 
inspection this week, TW engineering noticed SWG had installed a bypass-valve 
on their meter station at the new facility.  This bypass was not in the 
originally approved drawings.  TW's policy does not allow for a bypass unless 
the customer has a non-interruptible contract.  We are waiting for an 
explanation from SWG and will likely ask them to remove the extra pipe.

Transport Options Program - A meeting to brief FERC Staff about the program 
was held in Washington this week.  Overall, the filing received a very 
positive response.  Staff indicated the program would assist them with their 
directive to respond to the SouthWest power crunch.  Issues to address in the 
filing will be ways to mitigate potential affiliate abuse, capacity hoarding, 
and provide specific examples of the types of options.   We are still on 
track to make the FERC filing the week of October 9.

Agave Energy - Has agreed to purchase an additional 10,000 MMBtu/d firm on 
the Atoka lateral beginning 3/1/01.  The contract is a one-part rate of 
$.05/MMBtu for one year for deliveries east of Thoreau.

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."  At FERC, the term "market-based" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting 
time.
I will be out Mon. and Tues.

You can see the splits between the gallup volumes, red rock and the pre existing deals.   I also need to verify the capacity added from the expansions.   Also need to begin to detail the volumes from Long term firm contract versus short term deals including IT etc.

Rod,

Following our conversations today it appears necessary to include more granular information in the transwestern model.  We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. 

This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for "reverse synergies."  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.

I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  

Please let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  

Jayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.	

Thank you,
Sarah

        Please ignore the previous memo.  I had a wrong date in it.  Thanks. Lynn

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.
 
Lynn

Michelle - I received the March information last night. It also noted the
February 2002 price was changed because it had been posted incorrectly last
month.

February 2002 price $2.07
March 2002 price $2.30

Rumor on the street is that the entire 200 MMcf/d of capacity in the PGT-NW expansion went to one shipper who offered max. rates for 35 years.

Michelle,

Per our earlier conversation, Burlington Resources agrees to purchase 15,000 of Ignacio/Blanco space for the month of October @ 
$.05.  We will purchase this capacity using EOL.  I will call you on Monday, September 24 to have you walk me through this.  Thank you.

Deals Closed--
 --Arizona Public Service - We sold 14,000 MMBtu/d to APS for April  - Oct, 
2001 from EOT - Topock for $0.23.  This was the space we had tried   to sell 
using the IOS last week.  The high bid then had been $.138/MMBtu and we 
rejected the offer.  APS had not been a bidder in the IOS.

 --CIMA Energy agreed to an IT agreement for 5000 MMBtu/d on the Crawford 
lateral.  This is an East-to-East deal at $0.065 plus fuel for 14 months   
beginning Sept 2000.  This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue 
(had shipped under a Duke FT for $0.02).

 --Texaco has agreed to extend its contract from Red Cedar to Blanco from 
January 1, 2001 through December 31, 2002 at $0.045.

 --Red Cedar - We have a verbal agreement on a 5 year deal with Red Cedar.  
Final details are being negotiated but the volume would range from  100,000 
to 150,000 MMBtu/d.  We will need to spend approximately $375,000 to expand 
the metering capability of the Arkansas loop.

 --Sempra has agreed to an FT agreement for Ignacio to Blanco for 30,000 
MMBtu/d.  The term is calendar 2001 for a $.06 rate.  We have approximately  
30,000 MMBtu/d of remaining space available.

Burlington Resources - Burlington claims we are limiting production from 
their Val Verde Plant because TW is unable to fully accept all the 
nominations of gas under the current operating agreement.  They claim 
approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues.  We are pulling together the 
data on exactly which days we have not been able to take BR's gas.  Thus far 
BR has rejected our revised wording in the interconnect amendment, 
specifically "best efforts" and "subject to operating conditions on TW", so 
we will need to revise this further.  We offered alternate receipt point 
flexibility at Ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at El Paso 
Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient 
to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.  They have suggested we 
consider giving them a deeper discount on their San Juan - Waha contract 
(80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06) but this is not acceptable to TW.  We are 
evaluating all options.

SouthWest Gas notified us they are within 90 days of being capable of 
receiving gas through the new interconnect in Nevada.  Under the terms of the 
agreement, we are now obligated to pay SWG the remaining CAIC of $417,500.

Transport Options Tariff--  Meetings were held this week with customers and 
internal personnel to flange up remaining details of how the  program will 
function.

Mid-year Employment Reviews were completed for all Team Members this week.

Kevin, as we discussed last Wednesday, following is a listing of the
issues addressed during our conversation concerning the Proposed
Transaction Between Panda and Transwestern.  I have also included some
additional questions which I thought of later.  Although I think I have
covered most of the issues, I am certain there will be more as we
continue our discussions.  As I currently understand, we are going to
try and continue our conversation on Wednesday.  Hopefully you will have
time to complete your hydraulic study and answer these questions/issues
by that time.  If you have questions concerning the following, please
feel free to contact me at (972) 361-1332 and I will try to help
clarify.

Maximum Hourly Quantity - Panda will require the minimum capability to
burn the Maximum Daily Quantity in a 16 hour period with the potential
flexibility to burn the plants complete hourly capability over a shorter
time frame.  Your voice message to Jim on Thursday, regarding a scaled
burn window based on notification timing, should address this issue. 
Although there may be instances where the actual burn will be over 24
hours, the assumption should be that under even the shortest
notification timing, 16 hours would be needed.  Something to consider
would be how to incorporate this schedule into the contract. 
Consideration would also need to be given in how this, and in general
the operations and requirements of a power plant, would potentially
deviate from the standard GISB nomination cycles and corresponding gas
flows and how to incorporate that into the contract.

Contract Rate - Although approximately $0.45/MMBtu has already been
mentioned, it should suffice to say that the lowest possible cost of our
gas supply, transportation and storage services is the goal.  There are,
however, a couple of points that could use some clarification.  First,
would the rates in the proposal be maximum rates as defined by a tariff
filing or would these be negotiated?  The current assumption is that
they are negotiated because of the increase for years 6 through 10 and
the escalator for the remaining 20 years.  The preference would be for
negotiated rates in order to eliminate any rate risk the project would
hold if they were tariff based.  If they are negotiated, a better
understanding of how the rate is broken into its various components
would be helpful.  If they are tariff based, a better understanding of
the anticipated increase and the escalator would be needed.

Fuel Rate - A better understanding of the reasoning and numbers behind
this rate would be beneficial.  Also, how does Transwestern track and
adjust for actual fuel percentages?

Delivery Term - A shorter term would be required, somewhere in the 10
to 20 year range.

Services - Although 500 psi may not be quite enough pressure at the
facility, the hydraulic study should give a better indication of the
actual pressures at the plant and should be discussed further after the
study is complete.  It should be noted that Transwestern's interconnect
with the facility could still be some distance from the plant,
therefore, increasing the pressure requirement at the interconnection
point to be greater than the plant's requirements.

Other Questions - What is the planned capacity of the lateral from
Copper Eagle to the TW/EPNG interconnect?  Would alternative receipt and
delivery combinations be charged based on the tariff commodity and fuel
for the particular path?  Since there is already alternate receipt and
delivery point capabilities, is the 50,000 MMBtu/day backhaul a
guarantee?  Although storage is planned at Copper Eagle, how can
Transwestern help manage daily imbalances and short notice start up and
shut downs in order to minimize penalty exposure?

Thanks for your help in trying to address these issues.  I look forward
to talking with you on Wednesday if not sooner.

Steve

Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.

 




Note:

Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.  The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.

This difference is mainly due to the following:
$10.0m   -   negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
$ 2.7m   -    SoCal rate issue - $not collected
$ 1.8m   -    additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.  

Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

Please call me at x36709 if there are questions

thanks,
richard

E prime would have interest in the following expansion plans:

1.  Creating a Cunningham/Maddox connection directly from the Linam plant:
Dave Engbrock (303-308-6002) would have more information on this idea in
terms of volume and rate commitments.

2.  Increasing the CIG/Tumbleweed interconnect capacity from 40,000 to
60,000:  During the summer, e prime flowed up to 15,000 from CIG into TW's
PEPL Pool;  if this capacity were expanded, we might be able to get more
supply off CIG.  The problem we had this summer was that at times the
capacity was reduced to 25,000 due to operational reasons, and that was not
enough room for all shippers.  Any additional supply that e prime brings in
from this area will most likely go to shippers who already have firm
transport to California, or e prime may be interested in shipping this to
the Waha area.

3.  E prime would be interested in 10,000/d of capacity from NW Pipeline to
Socal Topock--term could be anywhere from 1 to 2 years, rate would be the
maximum rate.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to contact me at
303-308-6072.

Subject:	SoCalGas/SDG&E BCAPs -- ALJ Brown Denies EGA Motion to Strike


ALJ Brown denied the EGA motion to strike, so testimony on both the  embedded cost-based and the long-run marginal cost-based (LRMC) methodologies  for revenue allocation among customer classes will be allowed in this  proceeding.   Attached is a copy of  her ruling.  Her primary rationale is expressed on page 6, as  follows:
".....the Commission has frequently  deviated from cost allocations based solely on LRMC, and has been moving  towards embedded costs for unbundled transmission and storage functions, as  evidenced in both the recent decision in the GIR, and in the Gas Accord for  PG&E.  Therefore, it is  apparent that the Commission is interested in comparing LRMC and embedded cost  for cost allocation purposes.  For  this reason, EGA's motion to strike testimony on embedded cost-based  allocation is denied.  Testimony  on embedded costs will be compared with the testimony on LRMC, to enable  parties and the Commission to determine which method, or combination of  methods, is most appropriate for allocation among customers of each utilities'  non-gas costs of service.   Including an embedded cost analysis in this BCAP might require more  work from all the parties, but the record will then be as complete as possible  so that the Commission can make a well-informed  decision."
She also ruled that, "The  evidentiary hearing schedule of May 21 through June 14, 2002, is not suspended  at this time.  No later than January  22, 2002, parties are to meet and confer to determine if a shift in the filing  dates for testimony will be sufficient to meet the needs of the parties' to  respond to the March amendments to Biennial Cost Allocation Proceeding  applications, and keep the established hearing schedule."

  Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required,  In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01.  Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding.  In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process.  If this isn't clear, please call    MK

Toby, I think NNG's looks great.  I agree, let's do the same for TW.

This is an FYI to the TW Mktg Rep's that the TW unsubscribed report will look a little different (see how NNG's is below).

Lindy, Perry

When we go into production, I think we would want to be similar across the pipes in look and feel for the Unsubscribed capacity.  We can set up the criteria to in several different ways.  Please see NNG's Unsubscribed site http://www.nng.enron.com/dob/etfr_avcap.html and click on Unsubscribed to view the dropdowns.   I would suggest this is the way to go for the TW Unsubscribed page. Unlike today where the user has to pull the complete page up on TW's Unsubscribed,  this will give the user capability to define what they are looking for.  Please let me know as soon as possible so Rich can set up the format for TW's Unsubscribed.  If you have any questions please let me give me a call 31527.

We will soon be posting TW's unsubscribed capacity to the internet from the new CAS system.  The CAS and EDI requirements have been defined; but we don't yet know how the data should be displayed on the internet.  Should we copy the format from NNG's long term unsubscribed capacity or from TW's current unsubscribed capacity?

I just spoke with Mark Kraus from EOG.  He has received the SAP spreadsheet itemizing the materials and is reviewing the information with the folks from his field.  When the review is complete, a wire transfer of funds will be sent to Transwestern.  Because Mark had been expecting another invoice with the revised amount, he now anticipates this review to take several days.  Once the funds are received, the equipment will then be shipped.

Mark mentioned that he thought they were installing all the equipment themselves and would not need our services.  What additional charges could there be?

The material for the I/C is ready to ship to EOG. Do we go ahead and send the material or hold till they pay? The material is in the Roswell CDC and will remain there with the exception of the building, till we receive your response.

EC,  I got a call from Mike Abbott today and the building is ready to go.
Do you know if Michelle has an agreement made or any $ for this material.
Or, should we have this shipped to them on a "good faith" basis.
	In the previous attached memo, I told EOG that I would let them know
when the building is ready, so I owe them a call as soon as I find out how
Enron wants me to handle the material.  If you want me to call Michelle
directly, I can do that, too, just let me know.  Thanks and have a great
weekend!

Subject: interactive open season test packages

The interactive open season test packages are loaded on ios.ets.enron.com.  
We put in the change where shippers must bid on the full capacity of the 
package, no partial capacities are allowed.  Even though the package with the 
3 month term has been loaded, we can remove it if we need to.  The following 
test user have been set up for testing.

user id  password package 15 volume package 16 volume

test1  user1  20000   0
test2  user2  20000   0
test3  user3  20000   0
test4  user4  20000   0
test5  user5  20000   49000
test6  user6  20000   49000
test7  user7  0   49000
test8  user8  0   49000
test9  user9  0   49000
test10  user10  0   49000

This iosadmin password is k97hyt86

Because the ios application hasn't been thoroughly used since February of 
1999, it is very important to do this testing.  I you need us to reset the 
bids or the end time, or if you notice any problems while testing, please 
page us at (877)497-3254.

Transwestern is in agreement with extending your Firm transport from Griffith to PG&E, with alternate delivery at Southwest Gas.  The term is November for 15,000 at a rate of .05, all inclusive with zero fuel.  Regulatory needs a paragraph substitution (see below) and unfortunately Contracts will issue a new number because of the changes.  Please submit a new Service Request and I will approve.  Thanks.


Substitute:

"For the term of this amendment, if any quantities nominated by Shipper hereunder cannot be scheduled because of an event of Force Majeure, Transwestern shall further discount the rate applicable to such quantities nominated but not scheduled to zero."

In place of:

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide an additional discount to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern, rendering the supplies unavailable.  The additional discount will be an amount equal to any quantities made unavailable multiplied by the Discounted Rate.

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Please see attached file.  The margins are lower as compared to last weeks 
because of a lower fuel index price and lower volumes do to the trail

Hey gang, I need your help.  The address below will take you to a spreadsheet of marketing contacts for the Sun Devil Project.  I need you to update the spreadsheet as you add customers and discuss the project.  I have added the first dozen that I know about.  Michelle, there is a new contact for Cook Inlet and I gave the lady your name and number after I walked her through the project.  

Please keep the spreadsheet current as you talk with customers.  Kim, Steve, Eric, and I will be reviewing the sheet regularly to view progress.  Let me know if you'd like to see it formatted differently or to have other info added.  You can also write out your notes and give them to Susan Wadle and she will input the info for you.

thanks for the help.
kh

P.S.  If you'd like to set up a shortcut on your PC desk top to take you directly to the sheet, let me know and I will set it up for you.

Do either of you have info concerning the intervenors/protestors and their issues that could be distributed electronically before next Tuesday?  Glen, maybe you could also distribute you summary of TW's filing with that info.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

Bill,

I took out the formulas of the worksheet and left only the figures for the calculation for the rates of the alternate deliveries in December.

Subject:	Transwestern Response to FERC Data Request - USGT Negotiated Rate Filing

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

The question came up yesterday whether a shipper who contracts for firm capacity for a year or more at a negotiated rate is entitled to a ROFR.

I've done some checking, and the answer is no, a negotiated rate shipper that entered into a contract after March 27, 2000 does not automatically get ROFR rights.   This was clearly stated by FERC in Order No. 637-A.   It does not matter whether the negotiated rate is above the maximum tariff rate; the contract is still not considered to be "at maximum rates" for ROFR purposes.

As you know, our tariff does allow us to mutually agree to include ROFR rights in a contract with a shipper who does not automatically get ROFR rights.  

Any questions -- let me know.

Effective immediately, the contracts group will change the procedure for capacity requests for Transwestern.

A note will continue to be sent via Lotus Notes showing the requested capacity (as it is now) for new FT's and amendments to FT's; however, Perry will no longer return the note indicating that capacity has been approved.  

This approval is now part of the CAS review process making the return notification redundant.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Dennis

Subject:	Re: Pigging from P-2 to P-3

All of the information provided below was very informative and allows me to make the best determination as to what is the root cause of the problem.  I became aware of this problem a while back when doing pressure profile modeling on the Panhandle lateral when evaluating proposed compression parameters for moving the NNG Gray interconnect to  P-3's suction via a new 1.75 mile pipeline connecting to NNG.  Pipeline hydraulics on the Panhandle line indicated that efficiencies where between 65 and 70% which could usually be indicative of liquids in the line or 2-phase flow. 

Walt's comments below provided information that would indicate that the liquid product (C6+) may lean more on the heavier end containing more octane plus components.  Thus, where normally I would split hexane plus into mole fractions of 50% hexane, 30% heptane, and 20% octane; in this case, I used a 50/20/30% split of hexane plus.  Using this split of C6+ in a process model allows a closer approximation of how the gas characteristics will behave at various conditions.  For the purpose of this analysis, the following is considered 1) Agave Red Bluff on-line GC data is used as pipeline quality of gas in Panhandle Lateral because GS report from Owens Corning delivery point is quite similar to Agave GC, 2) gas temperatures will become nearly the same as ground temperatures which is provided on SCADA at P-1 and P2 3) pressure and temperature profiles on the Panhandle lateral at 6/14, 9:00am flowing conditions are listed below
 
The following graph (attached in MS Word) is a phase envelope using the Agave Red Bluff gas analysis.  By mapping the above relative pressure/temperature points it is clearly observed that pipeline pressure and temperature conditions approach and cross the hydrocarbon dewpoint line indicating that liquids would exist.
 
The graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced.  That explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between CS P-2 and CS P-3.  Furthermore, using the process model used to generate the phase envelope, the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degF would exist in both vapor and liquid phases.  Using a flow rate of 100 MMcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 Bbls. per day that could amount to approximately 2400 Bbls. per month.  This liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by Randy and Walt below.   

Lets get together on a conference call to further discuss findings and possible solutions.  For a first stab, how about Tuesday, 6/19, at 8:00am(CST)?  Reply with availability and number of ports required.  EF 713/853-3395

Subject:	Re: Pigging from P-2 to P-3   

Thanks Randy. Along with the things you have stated we have a delivery point to Gas Company of New Mexico near Portales ,NM. We do have a small scrubber there that we usually have to have hauled once a week and sometimes a couple of times. The (Owens-Corning) delivery can and will get us in trouble sooner or later if we don't get a handle on liquids. I have ask Eric Faucheaux to take a look at the system and give us some ideas on where most of the liquid is falling out.

I have talked with (Agave) the producer about this and we're working together to try and figure out what's going on. We can pick up water on our instruments but there's not anything that we know of that will show condensate. This has to be carrying through in the gas because there's not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point. The best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often. After getting the liquid in at P-3 we ran a pig from Roswell to P-1 and it came in dry. As soon as the volumes come up we'll run from P-1 to P-2 then into P-3. Thanks for everyone's help in this. If we need a conference call to discuss let me know.

It had been about six weeks between pig runs this time. Total received on the system was about three thousand barrels this time.  The time before this run we received about six thousand barrels.

Thanks 
RJ

Subject:	Pigging from P-2 to P-3

Gary, we recently had to run a pig from P-2 to P-3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line.  We had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line.  Apparently, in order to run a pig, some volume has to be routed to that line.   I understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this, but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it:

The condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with Energas.  This point feeds some domestic customers.  We don't want condensate getting into this point.
There is a customer on this line (Owens-Corning) who gets fuel from us.  Their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes.  At any given time, I am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production.  If they lose fuel, the product is lost and we could be liable.  I am also told that once the plant goes down, it could take a long time (even weeks) to get it back up.
The Owens-Corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel.  When the line has large amounts of condensate, we have been asking Energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point.  This is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure.  The gas from Energas is NOT measured.  They used to have the contract, but when we got it, they removed their meter setting.  Apparently they agreed (verbally) to supply gas to the plant in March, for a few hours, when a pig was run.  The plant uses about 3 mmcf/d and Energas was on for about 3 hours.  I was notified today that Energas sent us a bill for the March pig run when we used their gas for fuel.....$21,000!  Obviously we will negotiate that amount, but they have us at a disadvantage.  I can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours.
Everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule, we would not get large condensate amounts into P-3 (which shuts us down, by the way), we would not have to use Energas, we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point, and we would not incur the overtime when this happens.

I'm sure Rich has some concerns also for the portion of the line in his region.
We would like to run another pig as soon as possible to see what is left in the line and then (depending on what we push into P-3) get on a regular schedule...possibly once a month.
What do you think we can do to work something out?
Thanks for any help you can give us.

Just for your information the liquids that we received at P3 is was very hot and high in BTU.  Clear and evaporated quickly.
We would like to run a pig once a week until we clear all the liquids in this line, then back off as liquids decrease.
Your help in this matter will solve many customer issues and concerns and our pipeline efficiency.  We had a 180 pound spread in pressure last week due to about 2180 bbls of liquid in this line.  We received about 1650 bbls on the run before.
Thanks and know you are appreciated!

Here is an updated version incorporating Jeff's and Lorraine's comments 
(also, a correction on the EOG volume).  It's still a "draft", I'm just 
trying to keep it to one page.

The TCR II surcharges are only charged on 20747 and 20748, the mainline contracts, not 20835 (it is a SJ contract).

I guess Conoco CR #20835 would also be billed the TCR surchage beginning March, 2002.

Let me know if you agree.

Thanks again!

Jeanette:

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Thanks!

FYI,

I have been testing the enhancement changes for LFT contracts that was 
documented last April and this item will move to production the weekend.  
This change will move the LFT validation process from the allocation function 
to the Rollover and Balance function. To explain,  when TW post a notice 
that  "No LFT is Available" for a location and gas day, the system will 
automatically schedule the LFT contract to zero for that day at that point 
during the 1st scheduling process after the nomination deadline which is 
called rollover and balance process. The current process today cuts the LFT 
contracts during our allocation function, which is the last process done on 
TW. 

We have also added the waiver flag to the contract system that identifies the 
LFT shippers who have signed the waiver granting TW responsibility to change 
their nomination from firm to overrun on days when no LFT service is 
available.
Both Lorraine and TK have a copy of this draft document that I created. 
Please review this waiver document and finalize any changes to it so this new 
service can be offered to the shippers. If you would like to post this waiver 
document to our web site under forms, please let me know.  Finally, the 
contract team will keep these waiver documents with the LFT contract file, as 
well as in their waiver log book.

Thanks Ramona

PNM - The FERC accepted TW's new tariff filing for purchasing capacity on 
PNM's Blanco to Rio Puerco line!!!  The acceptance is conditioned by TW being 
limited to acquire this off-system capacity to the Apr-Oct period and we must 
file a report with the Commission at the end of the 2 year period detailing 
what impact, if any, this proposal has had on the market.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - El Paso pipeline called this week and agreed 
with TW that they had been erroneously calibrating their Blanco meter for the 
last several years and did in fact owe TW gas volume.  They would like to 
offset the balance owed TW against volume NNG owes El Paso.  Market Services 
is verifying the net volume figures.  The settlement volume proposed by El 
Paso is 91% of everything we requested.  We will attempt to take the 
approximately 651,000 MMBtu back at Window Rock over a 30 day period 
beginning in October.

Arizona Public Service - We have re-negotiated their FT agreement prior to 
the ROFR being triggered at the end of September.  APS will renew its 8,000 
MMBtu/d Permian to Needles agreement at the max rate for one year as well as 
the provision if they release the capacity at greater than max rate, TW and 
APS will share the upside 50/50.

Red Cedar Gathering - We received the signed letter agreement from Red Cedar 
which commits them to full reimbursement of the capital expense necessary to 
increase the Arkansas Loop meter from 200,000 MMBtu to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  We 
expect this meter increase to be completed and flowing in excess of the 
current 200,000 MMBtu/d by January 1, 2001.

System Expansions - We have updated our cost estimates and RAROC for 
expansions of the I-B Link, Blanco to Thoreau and mainline segments of the 
pipe.  We will follow up with PNM today on cost comparisons.  The TW 
expansion appears to be more cost effective than PNM's. 

The BP Amoco/Vastar merger is set for completion today.  Amoco will begin 
marketing Vastar's equity gas beginning 11/1/00.  Amoco has expressed a high 
level of interest on the remaining capacity from Ignacio to Blanco and from 
Red Cedar to Blanco for 2001.  They will provide a firm offer to TW next week.

Line Outages:
The September 13th allocation due to compressor failure in TW's West of 
Thoreau Area allowed for 42,0000 MMBtu of IT volumes to flow from PG&E Topock 
to Socal Needles.  Revenue generated at max rate equaled $10,500 to partially 
offset the commodity and fuel loss.

EOG Resources - EOG executed the Interconnect and Operating agreement for the 
15,000 MMBtu/d we expect from their new well.  Transwestern has initiated 
landowner notifications which  takes at least 30 days.  We continue to 
negotiate with EOG on becoming a new shipper and taking firm transport on TW. 

Burlington Resources Val Verde Plant - TW's ability to accept the contracted 
volume from the plant on a consistent basis continues to be an issue.  High 
temperatures and volume flow in the San Juan region have reduced our 
capacity.  BR is requesting relief to offset the monetary impact of gas that 
was shut in or sold at lesser margins in other locations.  We are working 
with Facility Planning to determine what capital / equipment may be necessary 
to meet our contractual demand.

Attached is a letter I drafted (with comments from Mary Kay and Drew) reminding shippers that the deadline for bids has passed and that bidding will be opened up to all interested parties.  The consensus was that this letter might help eliminate any misunderstanding about the open season process.  Please send this to your respective shippers (only those who sent a timely response to the open season).  Also attached for your reference is a posting I'm having Toby put on the website.

Guys - Weather permitting in the Texas Panhandle area, I expect to be in 
Friona, TX on Monday, November 20th, on business.  Provided below are some  
items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting:

Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately 
half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW.  I will be meeting 
Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on 
Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in 
additionaI to other general business matters.  I discussed my action plan 
with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000, 
latest date.  Effective Febrary 1st,  TW will also include penalty payments 
with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level.  

Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to 
spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well 
recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW.   Pogo's well 
will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time.  
They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG 
well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional 
drilling in the field area.  

CIG - A conference call was held with CIG on Friday to discuss delivery 
performance issues of deliveries to the CIG/Tumbleweed point and the ability 
of them to increase their delivery capacity to Transwestern.    They 
explained that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along 
the line which provides deliveries to Transwestern, El Paso, NNG and 
SPS/Nichols.  All shippers holding capacity along this line (capacity 200 
MMcf/d)  already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to El Paso 
and SPS.   Currently they have no operational capability to provide any more 
incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed.  However, they have 
indicated a probable second Raton Expansion project will be announced March 
2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a 
possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery 
capacity to Transwestern above the current 40 MMcf/d level.  I will be having 
additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who, 
besides  El Paso and Evergreen, are the primary existing shippers down the 
southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign 
their contract to Transwestern as a primary delivery point.   

Expedition of Contracting Process - Per Kevin's request, I provided him, and 
also discussed, several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing 
contract processing cycle.  The most important and critical recommendation 
was to revise the 3 year old ET&S Discounting Policy which Bill Cordes had 
established for both TW and Northern.  Obtaining approval of even a few 
simple changes I could recommend to the Policy (applicable only to 
Transwestern, not NNG) would have an immediate effect of simplying the 
Officer approval process and would expedite the turn-around time.

Please find attached the internal procedure list for Transwestern's IOS which 
will be held Thursday, August 10th.   The bid package shall be for 14,000 
Dth/d of East of Thoreau to PG&E/Topock capacity for a term April 1, 2001 - 
October 31, 2001.  Alternate capacity rights will include alternate receipts 
in Transwestern's East of Thoreau Area, excluding Rio Puerco, as well as 
alternate delivery rights at SoCal/Needles, Mojave/Topock, Citizens, and the 
Griffith delivery point (subject to point activation). Please note that some 
of the IOS responsibilities I have traditionally been responsible for have 
been re-assigned due to the fact I will be in Denver for the August 8-11 
period for customer meetings (Western Gas Resources, Aquila) and the COGA 
conference.

The posting notification will be forwarded as soon as legal signs off.

Summary of COGA conference follows.  FYI - at the time of the conference, the 
conference organizers indicated that all speakers presentations would be made 
available at the COGA.org websit after the conference.  However, COGA is 
currently experiencing difficulties in actually getting each speaker to 
provide this information.  I have requested a copy of the Interstate Pipeline 
(CIG/Questar/El Paso/Transcolorado/Western/NWPL) presentations to be mailed 
to me and will circulate them when I receive them.  They provide interesting 
summaries of pipeline expansion programs. 

Main conference themes which seem to be repeated among various speackers 
include the following points:

  -  Annual U.S. domestic requirements are headed towards the 30 TCF point 
sooner than expected.  One attributable reason for the higher than expected 
growth rate was the impact of growing internet & cellular activity of the 
nation.  It was estimated that these combined markets have grown from 
representing 2% of total electrical requirements of the nation to 
approximately an 8-10% range which will be sustainable from this point 
forward.  In addition, overall healthy economic growth of the nation also 
contributes to the increase in domestic gas demand.  
  -   Power River Basin coalbed methane production has the highest potential 
growth opportunity for Rocky production.
 -   Currently the companies most active in Rocky Mountain exploration & 
production are experiencing a shortage of geologists, engineers, and field 
personnel which they fear may impact the desired rate of field  developement 
- Rig counts in the Rockies are on the rise, but additional rig availability 
is also an issue which may impact rate of production.
- The only pipelines which actively promoted access to Waha markets for Rocky 
production were El Paso and Transcolorado.
- El Paso was already encouraging interest in the 1.2 BCF of capacity which 
El Paso Merchant Services currently has on their system which will expire 
October 01. 
- General conference discussion opinion is that the  Alliance in-service 
impact will be fairly neutral to market demand and gas prices for Rocky 
production.  They continue to be optimistic with their growth opportunities 
and price expectations.


Customer Meetings:

Western Gas Resources - met with Bill Koch (project developer), Chris O'Dell 
(Texas gas marketer), Andrew Carter and Andrew Richmond (western region gas 
marketers).  Western is in the process of purchasing some NNG lines which are 
in close proximity to the most southern part of Transwestern's West Texas 
lateral.   Western would eventually like to deliver treated gas into this 
line,  once Traswestern cleans the line and finalizes the Gomez to Puckett 
Tie-Over, in order to access our Waha markets.    Upside potential exists to 
eventually have access to two Western plants  totaling approximately 150 
MMcf/d of supplies through this arrangement.    TW would most likely have to 
enter into some form of transportation agreement with Western in order to 
justify the $2MM price tag for the Gomez to Puckett Tie-Over.

Aquila - Met with Tori Campbell, Goerge Nunnemaker, Mark Magliery and Nick 
Thomas to discuss general TW issues.

Michelle,

	I track all of the EOL deals on NNG on the attached spreadsheet.  I'm POSITIVE they will be asking you for EOL information as your list of deals grow.  Take a look at this format and feel free to make any changes for the TW deals (if you want to start tracking them).

Perhaps this can help with the non-Red Rock piece.  This spreadsheet takes current rates and multiples out against MDQ for 2002.   It also show billing units through 2005.  I have reconciled this schedule with Jan Moore and Lindy Donoho

Jan if you are here today can I get you to help me out with some info.	The most important thing I need is actual volumetric data going back and projected as far out as you have it.    You can see the splits between the gallup volumes, red rock and the pre existing deals.   I also need to verify the capacity added from the expansions.   Also need to begin to detail the volumes from Long term firm contract versus short term deals including IT etc.

Subject:	Additional TW information request

Rod,

Following our conversations today it appears necessary to include more granular information in the transwestern model.  We believe the information that Jayshree and I have included in the attached spreadsheet will help the potential investors become more comfortable with the numbers. 

This information should include a breakdown of revenues based on existing capacity, Gallup and Red Rock.  Please note that under the transportation section the first subheading is a volume request and the other sub-headings are revenue requests.  We would also like a better understanding of the capacity utilized for each section.  From an operational expense standpoint we need to show the historical breakdown, but going forward we need to assume that TW is a standalone entity. This should include additional costs for "reverse synergies."  Also, a breakdown of CAPEX would be helpful.

I don't know if all of this information is readily available, but any information you have would be greatly helpful.  As you discussed with Jayshree would you please send the 2001 and 2002 models to us electronically?  If you have this information in many places please send it to me and I would be happy to incorporate it into the template if it would save you time.  

Please let me know if you feel the template does not capture the relevant information.  I will be in at 7am tomorrow if you would like to discuss this information.  

Jayshree and I also have additional information requests from our conversations of the last two days, but I will send that information in an e-mail tomorrow.	

Thank you,
Sarah

Hi Michelle,

I am in the process of reconciling the Tumbleweed imbalances and the
spreadsheet you faxed me is a tremendous help.  Would you be able to provide
any support for your imbalance number at Mojave - Topock?

Please note charge code discussion under item 1h.  We need to discuss soon.  This will be something we need to maintain.  It will be a place where the "total rate" for a contract is stored.  Because of the shifting between reservation and commodity on these contract rates, the report wouldn't be able to get the accurate rate.  A charge code is being set-up for there to be a single slot to put the total rate.  After checking invoices yesterday, I'm not sure this is such a bad idea in general anyway.  We may want to be able to run a copy of this report by contract # to see the total rate for invoice/firm book verification purposes.

Now that the latest round of TW's negotiated rate hearing is behind us, we can re-focus our attention on the monthly reporting requirements imposed by the FERC on July 25, 2001.  Please review the attached document that addresses all the issues that were raised in prior meetings and provide your comments by COB September 7, 2001.  

I will then work with Don Powell to gather/compile the data required for the September 30th filing and distribute to the primary reviewers by mid-month.  Once the reviewers have had an opportunity to analyze the data, we can distribute for review and discussion.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

 


Thanks,

Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate 
deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" 
section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 
30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.

Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account 
information.  My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual 
contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual 
here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval 
as soon as possible.

Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if 
possible.  Thank you.

Approved.

This will complete the PP&L Red Rock expansion contract.  I think we are on amendment #4.  They will now have all 20,000 MMBtu/day for all of their 30 years and 1 month term from the West Texas pool.

Today, environmental laws govern virtually all aspects of Enron Gas Pipelin=

At the same time, GPG=01,s environmental performance receives greater scrut=

The Commission issued an order today rejecting Transwestern's filing to purchase and sell options for firm transportation capacity.  The Commission found that Transwestern has not met its burden of proof that its proposal will overcome the adverse consequences identified by the parties to this proceeding.  Specifically, the concerns raised by the protestors included:  the reservation of future capacity without a concomitant payment of reservation charges, which precludes other shippers that place a higher value on the capacity from acquiring the capacity; the use of the program for speculative purposes; and the absence of a recourse options rate to provide protection to shippers as required under the Commission's negotiated rate authority.  I'm faxing the order.  I presume we want to seek rehearing?  Maria

Attached for your review and comment is the proposed TW handout for the CPUC workshop on gas infrastructure on Tues. April 17.  I've been told by the Energy Division staff that with the significant amount of data they're expecting to receive during the workshop and with the expected interest/participation, Transwestern may not have an opportunity to speak.  However, they have encouraged us to produce any handouts we'd like to distribute on Tuesday.

Since I'm out of the office on Monday, please call me and leave me a voice mail message indicating whether changes or modifications to the handout are needed.  If so, please return email your changes and I'll stop by Monday before I leave and incorporate them into the handout.  If not, I'll ask Audrey to prepare approx. 80 copies that I'll pick-up on my way to the airport Monday p.m.  Thank you.

Agave Energy - Agave purchased a seasonal winter transport agreement for 
7,000 MMBtu/d on the Atoka lateral through May 2001.  This effectively sells 
out the Atoka and actually bumped some gas Duke/GPM had been delivering to 
the pools for free.  Incremental revenue for this deal is $70,200.

EOG Resources - The new EOG well on the West Texas lateral has been connected 
to TW but we are waiting for them to install an EFM device before we allow 
the gas to flow.

Burlington Resources - The letter agreement amending the interconnect and 
operating contract for the Burlington Val Verde plant on the San Juan lateral 
was sent this week.  We will adjust the prior period and remaining 2000 
invoices once the contract is signed.

PNM Capacity - FERC issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  We had asked for rehearing of the order limiting 
TW's acquisition of capacity to summer-only months.  There is no deadline for 
the Commission to act on our request so we'll have to wait to see when it 
appears on the docket.

PG&E - Representatives visited TW's offices this week to discuss a number of 
things including western gas flows, storage, winter and summer peaking 
capability, and EDI interface possibilities.  In response to TW's request, 
Rod Boschee indicated they may increase their capacity to take TW gas from 
300,000 up to 400,000 MMBtu/d!!  They would like to implement this change 
before Thanksgiving (in time for bid week) but are waiting on some upper 
management approvals first.  To date, they have been very pleased with the 
efforts of TW personnel to clean up the various substances contaminating the 
PG&E line.

Subject: I didn't think I was finished negotiating


Lorraine, I wanted to send you an e-mail about our negotiations regarding
TW/VV interconnect.  I don't want you to feel like I am trying to renegotiate
something you think we agreed to last week.

When we were talking last week about concessions I was seeking from TW in
lieu of underperfomance at the VV interconnect, I gave the example of
reducing our alternate delivery rate on the Jack Rabbit agreement, but I
wanted to talk to you further about it.  We agreed that you would call me
this week to talk about it.  It was my intention that the negotiations were
not over yet, but that we need to talk further.

Quite simply, a discounted rate on an alternate delivery point for an
agreement where I don't have a lot of volume does not do much for
Burlington.  The lack of TW's ability to accept nominated volumes from Val
Verde as mutually agreed to in the IPOA is a big and expensive issue to
Burlington.  It significantly limits our ability to operate the plant
efficiently, honor nominations of third party shippers on the system and it
is causing BR to nominate extra volume into the EPNG system which is
constrained.  All of these factors cost Burlington a significant amount of
money.

Some of the concession I am seeking include:  The same discounted rate to
make alternate deliveries into EPNG as TW at Blanco on agreement 25597.  The
same discounted rate for alternate receipts north of the LaPlatta compressor
station which in contrary to the language on agreement 25597.  I realize that
BR would be alternate firm, but the agreement would be higher in the queue
than interruptible.

Alternatively, what about terminating 25597 retroactively back to August 1.
The agreement expires at the end of the year and I really don't need the way
it is currently structured.  I have an IT agreement for $.03 with all of the
flexibility that I am looking for on 25597.

I have not sold this idea to my boss or anyone else in management.  We have
had a conceptual meeting about this issue.  It was agreed that our first
option was not to ask TW to spend a bunch of money to bring you into contract
compliance.  Instead we wanted to work with you to find some common ground.

The bottom line is that you have to give me something to take to my
management.  Please call me to discuss this.  I really do want to keep these
negotiation up beat.  I think past negotiations have not gone as well as you
or I would have liked.  I really look forward to talking to you and working
something out that is agreeable to both companies.

Gov. Davis announced today his appointment of Mike Peevey as Commissioner at the CPUC to replace Com. Bilas who resigned last week.  Mr. Peevey is the former President of Southern California Edison and as such advocated deregulation.  Consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state Senate approval.  Below is an article from the Sacramento Bee.  gh


Davis names ex-Edison chief to PUC
But the action stirs anger: 'Our worst nightmare,' says a consumer lawyer.
By Stuart Leavenworth -- Bee Staff Writer
Published 5:30 a.m. PST Wednesday, March 6, 2002
Gov. Gray Davis has appointed a former president of Southern California Edison to a state panel charged with regulating Edison and other public utilities.
Davis said Michael R. Peevey would bring "more than three decades of experience" to the Public Utilities Commission -- experience that immediately came under fire from the state's consumer groups.
Mike Florio, a lawyer for The Utility Reform Network, said Peevey has a record, both in government and in business, of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers.
"This is a our worst nightmare," Florio said. "It is like putting Dr. Kevorkian in charge of a nursing home."
Others were more supportive. D.J. Smith, a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users, lauded Peevey as someone "who understands all sides of the energy business" and will be fair to all sides.
"I think he will be objective about Edison because he doesn't owe Edison anything," said Smith, noting that Peevey left the Southern California utility nine years ago.
The husband of Assemblywoman Carol Liu, D-South Pasadena, Peevey replaces PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who resigned last week. Bilas was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson.
If confirmed by the state Senate, Peevey will solidify Davis' control over the PUC, a five-member board that now includes three of the governor's appointees. It also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state's other large utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., on terms for PG&E's reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
PG&E spokesman Ron Low declined to comment on the appointment Tuesday, but last year Peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped PG&E avoid bankruptcy.
Hired by Davis to negotiate with the utility, Peevey reportedly struck a deal with PG&E Chairman Bob Glynn that would have let PG&E charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity. But other Davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart.
For three years, Peevey was president of Edison International and Southern California Edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company Chairman John Bryson.
Peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of NewEnergy Inc., an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to AES Corp. After working as an adviser to Davis, he had been CEO of TruePricing Inc. and also has served on the board of Excelergy Corp., an energy software company.
With his new six-year PUC job, Peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants, water companies, natural gas supplies and other industries.
After a review by PUC lawyers, Peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.
Peevy's appointment was one of two Davis made Tuesday. He also appointed John L. Geesman to the board of the Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid.
Since 1985, Geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. in San Francisco. He once served on TURN's board.
Consumer groups, which had pressed for a meeting with Davis for the past week, said the he may have timed his Election Day appointment of Peevey to minimize negative media coverage.
Maviglio called that claim "ludicrous." Today's papers, he said, "will be some of the best read this year."

Ben and Ron--
	Following up on our meeting today, I need to know what my negotiation parameters are regarding the fuel charge for our Sun Devil Project.  How much (if any) can I discount the fuel charges for Sun Devil shippers, based on the following assumptions, 

Project cost $911mm
Include all compression adds/mods from Doug Cebryk engineering scope dated 9/28/01
Incremental Volume MMBtu/d: 780,000 San Juan, 810,000 Mainline, 500,000 to Phoenix, 310,000 to Cal Border
Of 1,520,000 total capacity to Cal Border and 500,000 to Phoenix, assume 390,000 has to come from East of Thoreau
Assume load factors in 10% increments from 50% west flow up to 100%.
Assume fuel collection of 5% from shippers

In theory, we all agreed in the meeting that with the additional loop line installed for Sun Devil, and the new compressors at stations 1-4 are more efficient, then the actual fuel use should be less.  Please verify this for the load factors above.  If we can keep the same net fuel retainage, but collect less because our actual fuel use is less, then this is a win-win for both TW and the Sun Devil shippers.

Is an answer possible by Tuesday 11/12?

thanks

		This note is to remind you of the May 22 deadline for
indicating your interest in booking capacity at an expanded Wild Goose gas
storage facility.

		We also wish  to inform you that AEC has now decided to
participate in a group that is examining the feasibility of the Ruby
Pipeline, which is being proposed by Colorado Interstate Gas to serve the
western United States. The proposed Ruby line would have a capacity of 750
million cubic feet per day and deliver gas from Wyoming to northern
California with a connection to the Wild Goose storage facility. The
addition of a large new pipeline in this region would also offer Wild Goose
storage customers a more liquid trading hub in the heart of the volatile
California gas market. AEC's preliminary assessment of this proposed project
is that it provides a very competitive means of delivering additional supply
flexibility into California from the growing U.S. Rockies production basin.
If you have any questions about the specifics of the opportunities to ship
gas on the Ruby Pipeline, please call Ed Miller at (719) 520-4305 and Tom
Dobson at (719) 520-4606 with Colorado Interstate Gas or if you have
questions about obtaining capacity at Wild Goose, please call either Ben
Ledene with Wild Goose Storage at (403) 266-8192, or Chris Price at (530)
525-0490 and Mark Baldwin at (925) 243-0350 with Interstate Gas Services.

		As we all plan to serve the growing California energy
market, we encourage you to consider all the marketing opportunities
available to you by having a strong gas storage position at an expanded Wild
Goose.

In paragraph4 b,  please delete the phrase that starts with notwithstanding the applicable rate in Tw FERC gas tariff.  The next paragraph covers the fact that the stated rate and fuel does not change and this phrase in 4b highlights it to the shipper.  
In addition, I think the capacity release paragraph needs modification, since these are greater than max at this time, we TW do not have the right to collect in excess of max rates.  except if we then refile these as negotiated rates??  Not sure what exactly to do but I think this needs reworked.   
Notwithstanding Drew's comment to file in support, we could make it that they agree that they will not file anything in oppostion if they file in the docket.  I'm not sure filing now does much for us.  Not a big deal.
Since the transactions will be negotiated rate deals,  it is understood that the shipper do not have ROFR rights, correct?
Please make sure that Steve Kirk, Glen and Mary D. are included in any routing.    thanks  MK

Looks good--with one suggested change.  Par. 6 on "Support" required the counterparty to file a "timely" intervention in support of the project.  Its too late for that.  Lets delete the word "timely" and it should be ok.  df

Here is a new version of the form Red Rock Agreement.  This version specifies a 5% fuel rate notwithstanding the existing tariff fuel rates.  It also contains the "sharing in the upside" language for capacity releases.  Lorraine, I've not included a waiver of ROFR rights since these shippers don't get ROFR inthe first place.  COmments -- please let me know immediately.

Dear Colleague,

The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California
Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is
available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com
<http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on
the paper.

Here is a summary of the paper:

        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter
electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public
Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring
competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and
more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy
suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.

        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April
1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster
for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.
Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable
concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity
industry. 

        Although a few states have decided, based on the California
experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.
Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are
that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for
California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and
prices affect market outcomes.

        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity
regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred
beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance
to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity
industry. This section makes several points: 

*	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new
generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned
to meet growing loads. 

*	Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural
gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,
maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large
regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. 

*	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and
voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale
markets). 

*	Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with
artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to
offer retail services without favoring individual competitors. 

*	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply
and price risks. 

*	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,
ancillary services, and transmission congestion. 

*	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and
vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and
transmission). 


        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and
prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer
efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve
reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing
options. 

        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is
turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because
electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is
our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy
to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a
real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the
same time. 

        Although the problems that have occurred in California are
substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should
focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and
accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to
recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond
the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and
wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to
have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces
time varying prices. 

        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for
wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will
enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and
price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability
services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,
and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants
will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Provided below are timelines representing the time between Shipper request 
for transportation and contract tendering by Transwestern for two of the more 
recent non-standard contracts which were provided by Transwestern to 
Southwest Gas Corporation and Sempra.  The provided timelines provide an 
example of the various factors which impact the turn-around time of a 
Shipper's request for service and the actual activation of a new or amended 
transportation service.

Kevin Hyatt has received a flow chart of all the processes of acquiring an 
executed contract from the point of contract negotiation to actual executing 
by shipper - a 10 step process.  Our group can certainly discuss options to 
expedite this process. 

Sempra

6/9  Sempra negotiates right to call upon TW Permian to Needles capacity.
  Sempra understands they need to submit formal request for transportation 
  for new service.
6/12  Stephanie Katz indicates she want the remaining 1,500 Dth/d of Needles 
  capacity.  Has not yet provided TW request for the "call" capacity.
6/20  Stephanie and TK negotiate rate for the 1,500.  Does not provide TW
  request for Transportation.
6/21  Sempra provides request for transportation for the 23,000 Dth/d of 
  capacity, but specifically asks TW to WAIT to process untill they
  determine their supply side receipt point allocation.  CS attempts to
  relay to Sempra the "alternate rights" which the discount letter will 
  contain as a heads-up.  Stephanie thinks she may want other
  flexibility (California Border alternates) and tells me to WAIT untill
  she thinks about it.
6/26  CS calls Sempra to remind them time is ticking.  Sempra finally 
remembers
  to lock up supply side of deal. Promises to call me TOMORROW.
6/27  Sempra leaves a message at 4:30 P.M with receipt point allocations. 
6/28   CS asks Stephanie if she plans to negotiate with Jeff for additional
   alternates like she had considered, she says no.  Now that TW finally 
  has received a complete request for transporation Contract Admin
  generates the contract with a 2-hour period.
    CS immediately routes mutually agreed upon discount letter to officers
   for approval.
6/29  Request made as to reason for delay of contract tendering to Sempra. 



Southwest Gas Corporation

5/25  Receive SWG request for transportation service.  CS begins to draft
  discount letter with SWG, specifically confirms all provisions of contract
  with account manager.
5/31  Contract received from Contract Administration.
6/5  CS received all Officer approvals for discount letter except Bill Cordes.
6/6  CS hunts down Bill Cordes for final officer approval.  Receives Approval.

  CS faxes Larry Black on 6/6 Transwestern's OFFICER APPROVED 
  contract and discount letter .
  CS leaves Larry Black a voice-mail indicating contract is out.
  CS leaves Lorraine message indicating contract was sent.

6/9  Lorraine receives "follow-up" changes from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black revised letter .
6/12  CS receives another "follow-up" change from May Kay to discount letter.
  Refaxes Larry Black another revised letter.
6/13  Larry Black calls me indicating there are accidentally two #2 
paragraphs on the
  letter.  I renumber the paragraghs and refax letter.
6/29  Request made as to why Southwest Gas only received contract on 6/21st(?)

Attached is the current version of TW's Firm Capacity Procedures.  (Posting requirements are defined in another document.)  These procedures outline the definitions of certificated/sustainable, operational/short-term sustainable and operational non-sustainable capacity and how we will determine how much and when capacity is available in each of these categories.

I thought I would go ahead and distribute this because there have been some questions - though I understand some of the recent FERC rulings may require us to change the procedures as it concerns, among other things, whether operational/short-term sustainable capacity is sold under LFT vs. daily under FTS-1.

Michelle,

As we discussed, PPL EnergyPlus is interested in transportation service from 
Griffith Energy Delivery to points downstream at the same rates we now receive 
(.2792 + .0022).  This also includes a zero fuel rate.  If you have any 
questions please feel free to give me a call.

Best Regards

David Smith

Steve, below is a partial answer to most of your questions.  Can we set a time for Wednesday afternoon 12/5 to talk?  thanks


Max Hourly Quantity:  we are reviewing capability to deliver the MHQ in a 16 hr block.  Doesn't appear to be any problem but we are working thru the hydraulic studies to verify and quantify.  What will be the plant's complete hourly capability?  If you're  receiving gas from both TW and EPNG, and for some reason EPNG shut off deliveries, we can model the impact of delivering all the plant's requirements for known durations.

Contract Rate:  will be a negotiated rate (eliminates rate risk for Gila).  The rate design is currently one-part (no differentiation between reservation and commodity).  The rate does not include ACA / GRI surcharges or fuel.  It covers a minimal return on the project's capital cost plus the ongoing O&M.

Fuel Rate: Fuel was set with the shippers in the 1996 rate case; the offer to Panda is consistent with the current tariff.

Delivery Term:  as the term gets shorter, the rate by necessity, goes up to cover the return hurdles.

Services:  delivery pressure at the Panda / EPNG interconnect should be a minimum 700 #

Capacity of the lateral from Copper Eagle to EPNG will be 500,000 Dth/d.

Alternative rec/del combinations:  Our thought here was if Panda is willing to commit to taking capacity in the project, then TW would give you all the necessary flexibility to move gas to other destinations at the Contract rate.  For instance, Panda would be paying a one-part rate for delivery to the plant.  If for some reason, plant demand was reduced, then you would have all the flexibility to move gas to alternative markets.  

Backhaul:  the 50,000/day would be a guarantee.

Daily imbalances, short notice start up/ shut down:  We have to plan for the worst case scenario and assume there is no storage.  With this in mind, TW will have some flexibility just due to the size of the project (36" pipe and 700 - 900 # pressure) but this will depend on what other shippers are doing.  Again, we are modelling the hydraulics.

It's been years in the making and includes an all star cast of several but 
it's finally here.  

We have a new way of doing Park & Ride Business on TW.

Over the past month or so, I have been working with Morgan, Mike Bodnar, and 
Susan Scott to streamline the PNR Process and what follows is the result of 
this process.  

Effective immediately, we will no longer use packets for TW Park & Ride.  All 
prospective PNR Contracts for TW will be be set up in CBS similar to PNR 
Master Agreements except that they will include a PNR point and the PNR 
Template.   Term will be for 1 (one) year plus evergreen.  This should allow 
reduced paperwork for the shipper as well as the Contract/PLE Team and should 
enhance TW's service to their customers.

The new procedure is in the Instruction Book on Michelle's desk.

Attached is a copy of the procedure as well as a copy of the PNR contract.  

Let me know if you need clarification of have any questions.

Cathy Bulf (918-591-5143) just called to negotiate the contract extension.  
Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 
2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at 
current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have 
tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can 
exercise her ROFR.

KN (Oneok) called to get more information about the Right of First Refusal in 
their current contract.  The minimum requirement to keep ROFR in a contract 
extension is with maximum rate for at least 1 year.  Cathy Bulf will let TW 
know by Monday, and in writing, if they would like to exercise.

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

Subject: Re: EOG Pronghorn Location  

If we bare any expense, EOG is suppose to reimburse us, but getting money out 
of them is like pulling teeth.  

I suggest we complete the work at the site and have our facilities ready to 
proceed when necessary.  Marketing is not in a position right now to pay the 
cost of the EFM.  Given that these volumes will flow under a "pooling 
agreement", there isn't any incremental revenue generated for TW.

We will get with EOG to request payment for the EFM before we proceed.  Any 
idea how much the EFM will cost?

Western executed 10,000 MMBtu/d of Blanco to Thoreau capacity effective June 2002, as an additional source of supply for their Red Rock expansion contract.  The capacity is for 15 years at the maximum rate, generating $5.6 million in demand charges.
Sold two packages of stranded firm transportation to Burlington Resources from LaMaquina to Blanco for November and December at $0.05 plus fuel, which gives TW an incremental revenues of $45,500 not already in plan.  These transactions were executed through EnronOnLine.

Please post the attached notice immediately.

(Marketers:  in paragraph 8, I've eliminated the min/max language since we're 
willing to do a rate over the max.
In paragraph 10, I've changed the tiebreak procedure.)

Regarding the subject interconnect, Bennie Neatherlin/TW Operations reported 
that the facilities have been sold to Duke some time ago.  The only thing 
that exists on TW system for the subject interconnect is a 4" side valve that 
is disconnected from the measuring facilities.  Should your prospective 
producer want to come to TW at this location, we would need to provide you 
with a Level "A" cost estimate for new interconnect facilities to connect to 
the existing 4" side valve.  TW's line pressure at the 4" side valve would be 
near 600-650 psig.  (Should they be interested in going to Duke, their line 
pressure is near 400 psig.)

Would you like for us to provide you with a cost estimate?  If so, what type 
of volumes are proposed and will dehy/production equipment be provided by the 
producer?

FYI - I spoke with John Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.  He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.  If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.

Subject:	Bloomfield to Gallup Pigging

To recap past conversations, Bloomfield to Gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last February.  It is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig.  If this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity, re-application of the DRA will be considered.

How does pigging Bloomfield to Gallup the first week in October sound?  Darrell pointed out that would provide a week's run time on the Gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for September 29.

I suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig.  The afternoon of Monday, October 1, a conference call would be held.  If there were no complications with Gallup or any other issues, the pig run would be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday.

If you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Also please let me know if having the conference call at 2:00 p.m., CST, Monday, October 1, would work for you, and if not, then what time would be good.  I will plan on sending out the conference number and code next Monday, September 24.

Thanks,


John

It has come to my attention that the Richardson PNR rate was less than previously reported....It also gave me an opportunity to corrected a mathematical error in my original e-mail.

I apologize for any inconvenience.

The following contracts were truly negotiated as one-part rates (inclusive of reservation, commodity and surcharges):

		K# 24194	PNM		$0.1100/dth
		K# 24568	Enervest	$0.2200/dth
		K# 24654	ENA		$0.2175/dth

The way the invoice system is designed, all contracts identified as one-part automatically generate 'credits for commodity' on the reservation invoice.  However, this causes us to underbill the shippers because these rates bump up against the max tariff demand rate.  In the past, we switched the flag to be two-part to minimize the amount of manual invoice corrections for the schedulers.

Because we are briefing contracts and beginning our data conversion review/process for the new ETS contracts system, we will correctly reflect the contract as negotiated.  Therefore, effective with September 2001 invoices, schedulers must remember to delete the credits for commodity on these invoices. Also, the marketers will need to ensure the input of any discounts (commodity and/or demand GRI surcharges), if necessary, to guarantee that TW does not overbill these shippers.

Bottom line, make sure that the total amount invoiced on the reservation and commodity invoices combined for these contracts =

	Rate listed above * Contract MAXDTQ * Number of Days in Month


If you have any questions about this process, please contact me.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

Michelle,  I believe this is the latest document electronically that I have.  But again, this is not the executed version so I'm not sure if it is the final one.  As you can see if has those minor formatting problems, but you still will need to check the language to make sure this on captures all the changes we ultimately agreed to and executed.

Thanks, Terri

Michelle:  I think I filled out the service request right.  We are looking to pick up the San Juan lateral space for 10,000 MMBtu per day starting 6/1/2001 for a term of 15 years to match our Red Rock expansion space from the Permian to the Cal Border.  Let me know if you have gotten the fax. 

In addition, is there any chance there will be any LaPlata-Blanco space becoming available at any time in the near future that you can see and what's the rate?  Hey who's releasing this lateral space?  I'm assuming someone turned it back since you said it was exisiting capacity.

Terri Dickerson

>>> "Lokay, Michelle" <Michelle.Lokay@ENRON.com> 10/19/01 03:20PM >>>
Sorry I didn't get to talk to you earlier...we have been in one meeting
after another!

What's going on?  The receipt points are in the Blanco area at the
Bloomfield Compressor, so that would include the Transcolorado point.
The NWPL interconnect is further north, where we are currently fully
subscribed.

FYI, one of the meetings I was in, was a strategy session on what to do
what all our remaining capacity (of which part of that is what you are
now interested in).  Transwestern is thinking of posting an open season
utilization this space with California capacity.  

It sounds like you guys are definitely interested and because I am out
of the office next Monday, please call me on my cell phone 713-907-3198.

Is the receipt point in SJ pool good from either NWPL or Transcolorado?

Duke - We sold to Duke a firm transport agreement that will bring 20,000=20

for year two.

NGPL Winkler I/C - This interconnect was activated on Monday and began=20

August Gas Sale - 10,000 MMBtu/d was sold for the month of August at=20
$4.10/MMBtu.

SoCal - Visited their office to discuss among several things the issue of t=

Needles Window.  SoCal's fluctuation of this set point has hampered TW's=20
throughput for several months now.  They agreed to give Transwestern a chan=

Additionally, PG&E has raised their window to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  These two=

Michelle,

>From our earlier conversation, this is what probably happened to Virginia's intended injection of 4,793 at the Panhandle Pool PNR point for 12/14/01 on PNR contract 27719:

Virginia had already discussed this type of transaction, meter bounce at NNG-Gray with Burlington, since Amy Mulligan and Chris Miller worked with Greg and Hillary to inject gas back into the park n ride point for 12/11 after their initial withdrawal on 12/10.  Amy informed the customer on how to nominate transaction type 31 to create a "bounce" on the TW side of the station.  They miscalculated the fuel usage and had to do a second bounce on 12/12 to balance their contract at that date.
Virginia again withdrew gas on their park n ride on 12/13 with the intention to inject the gas on 12/14.  The problem appears to be that Burlington did their nomination for the Timely cycle, but Virginia did not get their information into our system until 3:00 pm which tagged it as an Evening cycle nom.
Chris Miller confirmed Burlington down to zero for the Timely cycle since Virginia's contract did not appear on this cycle.  I do not know how Chris knew about this particular gas day's transaction.
The TW late shift person did not know (or forgot) about the meter bounce so the two transactions did not get confirmed on the Evening cycle.
The scheduling system will not display any meter bounce information unless you specifically request the point AND the meter bounce filter.  
Our usual procedure to review unconfirmed nominations is to select a blank/null point and the "shipper nom" filter.  It appears that meter bounces will not appear under this scenario.  Our system will also not show meter bounces by selecting a blank/null point and the "meter bounce" filter.  Our system does not have an "all noms" filter.  Since meter bounces are relatively rare in our system, shippers are strongly encouraged to contact us when they submit a meter bounce nomination; otherwise, we do not look for them in the system.
I am working with Terry Kowalke to make meter bounces more visible to us, but no one here is aware of any conversations with either Burlington or Virginia Power regarding the meter bounce for 12/14 or any later date.

Please let me know if I can supply any further information.


Thanks,  Bert

El Paso Tests Market for Mainline Expansion
El Paso Natural Gas apparently got the message when its last open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of firm transportation capacity attracted bids for 14.4 Bcf/d. The pipeline has announced an open season to test market interest in a mainline expansion and to satisfy regulatory concerns that something needs to be done to relieve the apparent capacity constraint at the California border. 
El Paso has been under significant pressure from regulators and shippers to expand because of enormous demand and skyrocketing prices in California. In a Jan. 3 letter to the pipeline, Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of Energy Projects, urged El Paso to consider modifying its Line 2000 project to "assist the difficult situation" now facing the California gas market. Specifically, the Commission recommended El Paso amend a pending application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system expansion. 
El Paso Vice President Al Clark told the commission that market demand for an expansion would have to be evaluated first. He said the open season for 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity being held by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy would give the first indication whether such an expansion was needed. 
Following such a resounding wake-up call, El Paso is holding a new open season to determine interest in additional capacity on the mainline or in relinquishing mainline space. The open season will end March 23. 
El Paso officials said they will consider requests for firm transportation service originating in any receipt basin and delivered to any location on its system. If a new load can be matched to an existing shipper's offer of release or relinquishment, El Paso will attempt to facilitate the transfer of the capacity between the parties prior to proposing an expansion. Upon receipt of non-binding expressions of interest, they will begin to identify appropriate facilities to possibly expand the system. 
Clark previously told FERC the pipeline could add compression to the proposed Line 2000 project or replace or recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon. Another option, he said, would be to add new compression to the existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. The economics of the project will determine the eventual form. 
For more information on the open season visit El Paso's web site <http://tebb.epenergy.com/ebbEPG/ebbmain.asp?sPipelineCode=EPNG> or call Jerry W. Strange, director of transportation marketing, at (915) 496-3139.

A couple of fyi items:

SoCal's balance was 151,133 mmbtus at 8/31/01.  Their balance is 300,521 mmbtus at 9/23/01.

We have received 33,130 mmbtus in payback from Williams through the 23rd which has decreased their balance to 242,260 mmbtus.

PG&E Topock's balance is 69,727 mmbtus due TW as of 9/23/01.


The index has decrease by about eighty cents during September which will cause a loss on volumetric oba's.

Here is how I see the February release, with the 50/50 sharing mechanism:

ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.1020 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $71,400 [$0.1020 x 25,000 x 28 days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will be adjusted for a capacity release credit of $56,700  [($0.1020 - $0.021) x 25,000 x 28 days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $14,700 [$0.021 x 25,000 x 28 days]
ENA will be looking for a payment of $14,700 for their portion of the shared upside


I'd copied your format for January...what do you think of the February numbers?

Amoco - Amoco has changed its name to BP Energy.  Two deals with BP Energy 
were closed late last Friday:

Ignacio to Blanco
18,000 MMBtu/d January, 2001
22,000 MMBtu/d Feb - Dec, 2001
retains ROFR
rate:  $0.07

Red Cedar to Blanco
21,200 MMBtu/d
Feb 1, 2001 - Dec 31, 2001
$0.045

Southwest Gas - Marketing and Market Services met with reps from SWG to 
discuss finalizing an OBA (we will use the currently effective OBA rather 
than the 637 filed OBA), nominations, scheduling and capacity release.  This 
is in preparation for their new firm transport agreement beginning November 1.

El Paso Field Services -  We have finalized the terms with EPFS for a new 
receipt point in Eddy County, NM.  EPFS will pay $190,000 towards the total 
cost of the interconnect of $330,000 (these figures include tax gross-up).  
TW will construct, own, operate and maintain the new interconnect which will 
tie into the high pressure line of the West Texas lateral.  The estimated 
in-service date is Jan. 1, 2001.  EPFS has committed to flow incremental 
supplies of 12,500 MMBtu/d for a 2 year commitment through the new point.

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - EP made some minor adjustments to the 
language in our settlement letter; final versions were sent out for 
execution.  They have already begun delivering the gas back to TW at Window 
Rock.  If the flow remains high, the payback may be complete before EP goes 
down for maintenance at the end of October otherwise we will complete the 
transaction in early November.   We sold 15,000 MMBtu/d of the volume for 
October to USGT/Aquila at $5.20/MMBtu.

Park 'n Ride - The new automated allocation procedures were implemented this 
week so customers can automatically nominate volume and the system will 
handle any necessary allocations.

Capacity Marketing - Gas control has determined based on current line pack, temperature, and flows, that TW could deliver another 10,000 MMBtu/d on a Daily Firm basis to the California Border.  This would put February seasonally adjusted capacity at 1,135,000 MMBtu/d.  Marketing has sold the extra capacity for  February 2 - 28 to Richardson Products based on daily index price differentials from Permian to Cal Border.

In addition, bids are due from prospective shippers on Friday February 2 for the 400,000 MMBtu/d block of east to east capacity with alternate rights to the California border.  The alternate west pricing is based on a sharing of the index differential.

TransColorado - TW has been informed by TransColorado (TC) that we have been approved to bid on the outsourcing proposal being requested by TC.  Bids are due February 16.

Enron OnLine - TW began marketing small blocks of east to east capacity packages on EOL effective February 1.

Here is a notice letter to Conoco terminating Agreements 20835, 20747 and 20748.
Please be advised that under the 365-day notice provision of 20835, there is a chance that Conoco could take the position that we have given notice one day too late and the contract therefore does not terminate until the end of the first renewal term, or February 28, 2003.  Ditto for the other two agreements (except they could only claim the agreements are effective until the end of March 2002).  To be on the safe side, I've included an "acknowledged and agreed to" signature block (even though Conoco is not required to consent to a timely notice of termination).  Any questions -- let me know.

New Mexico Train De-railment - Most of this week was spent helping customers 
re-route gas as the train derailment on TW's right-of-way in McKinley County, 
New Mexico forced Operations to blow down the mainline in the east of Thoreau 
area.  The accident reduced flow to the California border by 250,000 MMBtu/d 
or 25%.  Once the 27 rail cars were removed, a determination was made that 
line would need to be hydro-tested to ensure no damage had occurred.  
Approximately 2000 feet of pipe was excavated, the coating inspected and/or 
replaced, and if test results are good, the line should be back in service 
sometime during the weekend of November 3.  While the pipe is being recoated, 
the line segment will only operate at 80% of maximum pressure.  TW costs and 
revenue losses are being tracked to enable us to recoup damages from 
Burlington and/or Enron business interruption insurance.

Sempra Trading - The loss of gas supply from TW's east end enabled us to sell 
a max rate IT agreement for 100,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra during this outage.  
Duke also moved 40,000 MMBtu/d of alternate volume west at max rates.

Transport Options Tariff - The deadline to file protests on TW's Transport 
Options Program was Monday October 30.  Twenty-two parties filed 
interventions, of which only three were protests: PG&E, SoCal/Sempra, and 
Dynegy.  We expect FERC to schedule a technical conference sometime in the 
next 30 days.

Non-binding Open Season - The solicitation was published and sent to 
customers this week asking for expressions of interest in capacity turnback 
or pipeline expansions across all of TW.  Responses are due November 17th.

For the first Update of 2002, we bring you a Case Study (first published in
erivativesreview.com) of how a hypothetical power distribution company was
able to protect itself against weather-related variable earnings by the use
of weather risk analysis and hedge transactions.  This is a very interesting
article which, although based on the concept of weather risk for an energy
company, could be equally relevant to a huge number of industries.  Scroll
down a little for the link to the full story...

Also, if you are or are likely to be involved in weather trading or indeed
any form of risk management, you might like to check out what will be going
on at our upcoming conferences, taking place in Amsterdam in February.  More
details are available further down in this Update...

And finally, of course, all of us at Eyeforenergy wish our readers a very
Happy New Year and hope that it will be a prosperous and gratifying one for
all of you!

ARTICLE: Weather Hedging At The Hot Air Gas Company
         (based on a true story of weather hedging)

The Hot Air Gas Company rises in a warm winter - based on a true story of
weather hedging...

The Hot Air Gas Company (HAGC) distributes gas to homes and commercial sites
in Canada, just across the border from the US city of Frozen Falls. In these
northern latitudes, the normally cold winters generate strong sales for the
company. However, the company, because it has weather sensitive revenue, has
a natural "weather bet". Through the warm winters of 1997-1998, 1998-1999
and 1999-2000 for example, the company struggled against declining sales and
weak revenues, and lost the bet. The winter of 2000-2001 was different: it
was so much colder than the long-term average of weather, that the company's
revenue was quite good - that is, the company won the bet....

EVENTS RUNDOWN

* EEO Europe: Energy Trading in the New Economy
  Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Following up for our sell-out conference in Phoenix, December 2001 that was
attended by over 250 CEO's, senior executives and press, and Energy
Exchanges Online II:  Energy Trading in the New Economy USA (September
2001), Eyeforenergy brings you the premier networking and discussion
conference for the energy trading community.  Meet, do business and discuss
the big issues over 2 days with the leaders in energy trading in Amsterdam.

* Emissions Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Emissions trading options are ripe for the picking - so how can you make
sure you're ready to profit from GHG?  Let's face it - you can't really
afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the
international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per
annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how
you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.  As ever, the
conference will be driven by the industry leaders in this arena, backed up
by expert advice from those helping the indsutry make the right moves in
emissions.

* Weather Trading 2002
  Okura Hotel, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002

Today's business is all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather
derivatives has become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging at
utilities, airlines, and agriculture have at hand to off-set risks
associated with temperature and precipitation.  With over 70% of Europe's
companies facing weather-related risk, knowing about the latest advances in
weather trading is a necessity.

Eyeforenergy's latest event will be run in conjunction with our European
online trading conference, Energy Trading in the New Economy, and
Eyeforenergy's Emissions Trading 2002 event, so you can learn about the
latest developments in energy and emissions trading all under one roof.

* The Business of Fuel Cells for Transportation
  Dearborn Hotel, Detroit, Michigan
  April 30 - May 1, 2002

As manufacturers are increasingly developing technologies with the energy
industry, the auto industry is globalising at an unprecedented rate and both
OEMs and suppliers are renegotiating their alternative vehicle programs.
This event will examine all possible applications in teh transport industry
including synergies with hybrid automobiles and the potentially lucrative
APU market.

Fueling infrastructure will also be covered and, with BP recently launching
Hydrogen fueling stations in Singapore, this issure could not be more timely
or pertinent.  If you have a story to tell, a product to promote or would
simply like to get the full lowdown on the movers and shakers in the
industry then, if you're not already in Detroit, you'll certainly want to be
there in April 2002.

Capacity Marketing - SEMPRA renegotiated a firm contract for April-October 
2001.  TW received an additional $.07 on 14,000 MMBtu/day for moving primary 
delivery POI from PG&E Topock back east to SouthWest Gas; incremental revenue 
was $209,720.

Sempra has also negotiated a true Daily Firm contract for the month of 
February 2001.  They purchased an additional 15,000 MMBtu/d to Needles made 
available by the higher window at SoCal and higher operating pressures on 
TW.   The volume will be index-priced daily based on volume transported.  
Assuming all the volume flows, expected revenue could be in excess of 
$2,000,000.

Red Cedar - We are working with Operations and Facility Planning to 
coordinate the tie-in of the new receipt point in the La Plata Station yard.  
All parties have agreed to the tie-in sometime between April 2 - 5.  We will 
provide the required notification to Northwest Pipeline once Planning 
notifies us of the estimated downtime and resulting cut in flows.

Project ___________ - TW's westward expansion moved into high gear this week 
as better project definition was achieved and groups began assembling data 
for the FERC application.  Filing is anticipated to take place mid-February.  
Customer contacts were also made providing deal parameters to interested 
parties (response has been positive thus far).

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has requested a meeting with TW Operations for 
next week to discuss the appropriate facilities needed to meet our 
specifications.  We have worked with Field Operations and Facility Planning 
in identifying the appropriate people to attend.

NGPL  - Met with representatives this week to evaluate turning the existing 
Winkler interconnect back into a receipt point on TW's West Texas lateral.  
The Marathon Indian Basin gas plant is expanding on NGPL and shippers are 
looking to move more volume to premium western versus depressed Chicago 
markets.  NGPL believes there is 50,000 MMBtu/d trapped behind the plant due 
to capacity constraints.  Ideally, they would like to move 100,000 MMBtu/d to 
TW.  NGPL will meet with interested parties to see if there is enough 
justification to set compression and sell the space on a firm basis.  Their 
timing, contingent on FERC approval, is 12 months which coincides well with 
TW's west expansion.

Have you had a chance to look at this?  I just wanted to make sure you 
verified the facts on the EOG well before I sent this out.

Thanks!

FYI

I received a voice mail from Jack Foley at PG &E wanting to breakup the prepayment ($ 1,700,000 ) due December 26 into four weekly installments. My response is to reject that request and walk him through TW with the most current information. This would be similar to what Kevin did with two vendors this morning, Nuovo Pignone and LaBarge Steel.

I just spoke with Elizabeth Brown and she said the agreements have been "intentionally" billed as 2-part, knowing they are actually 1-part agreements.  Billing as a 1-part would require a significant amount on manual intervention on the Commodity paths by the Gas Logistics group.  This 2-part process has been used for these agreements for quite some time.  It is unlikely we would change the billing method at this point but are willing to discuss further if you desire.

Subject:	Switch TW Rate Type Flags

E.B.,

	Can you change the flag in CBS to show contracts as 1-part agreements?  Michelle Lokay and Jeanette Doll said an ECT (K# 24654) and a Enervest (K# 24564) agreement are flagged (incorrectly) as 2-parts.  I pulled up the original text in Envision and they are indeed 1-part agreements.  Can you help?  I need to get CBS loaded on my PC and need access...

Here is the file of TW rates that will be posted on the EBB under Informational POstings, Rates on Monday.
The only change is the footnotes at the end where ACA is .0021 instead of .0022.

You may want to forward this to the TW Marketers in Houston.  I don't have a distribution list for them.

I hope that you found the August 25 electric class informative and thought 
provoking.  I 'm sure that in some cases the material was too basic and in 
other cases the information was more than you wanted or needed.

Please send me some feedback on the class, including:

How were the speakers?  Did you enjoy Jim Crist and John Adamiak?  Would you 
prefer having an Enron speaker or an outside speaker at any future electric 
sessions?

Did the class cover the right topics?  Are there any additional areas for 
which you are looking for information?

Do the written materials suit your needs?

How about the setting?  Was the whiteboard instruction approach useful?

Other thoughts?

As reported in Gas Daily today, the CPUC has issued a report assessing the state's gas infrastructure of the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide seasonally reliable amounts of competitively priced natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  Other conclusions: conservation will reduce demand on the infrastructure, improved coordination between electric and gas operations can enhance reliability, and the CPUC should continue to evaluate the need for gas infrastructure expansions.  Below is the link if you would like to review the entire report.  gh

Thanks Michelle, I got the agreement and am looking at it and forwarding it internally for review.

Also, can I get a copy of your filing that you make with FERC regarding this Red Rock expansion?  Is that something that you can easily fax or e-mail to me?  If not, then could you get me the filing numbers.

Thanks, Terri Dickerson

Hi Michelle!

I am assuming that, like most IT agreements, we can put a base agreement in
place and then negotiate short-term discounts when available from time to
time (last time I talked to T.K. about this capacity it was discounted to
like a penny or 1.5 pennies)?  One of the reasons that we've never gotten
anything accomplished here is that we alway's seem to be doing in the middle
of bid-week.

So, if we can, I'd like Bryan to work with you immediately to begin the base
agreement processing.  OK?

Thanks!

Scott

There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks

Subject:	Re: Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the facilities asap.

Subject:	Pogo Interconnect

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Michelle, 
	We are looking forward to the planned meeting between BR and TW to further discuss the Window Rock interconnect.  The following is
an informal agenda listing of topics:

1.  BR would provide an overview of our November 6th discussions with EPNG regarding the Window Rock Interconnect.  

2.   As discussed, it would be beneficial if TW would be able to discuss the operating parameters along TW's pipeline system prior to and
after the proposed Red Rock expansion.  In particular, BR would be interested in expected pressures/volumes at Window Rock, Station 4, 5 and
Thoreau prior to the expansion and after the expansion with 0mmcf/d, 50 mmcf/d, 100mmcf/d, and 150mmcf/d delivered at Window Rock into TW.
The Window Rock deliveries into TW would physically service markets to the west while allowing TW to reduce physical flow from the eastern
delivery points by providing the eastern backhaul service to BR.  

3.  Discuss potential system or operating modifications to allow Window Rock deliveries. 

4.  Review potential alternative delivery points into TW for backhaul service. 

5.  Discuss potential meeting between TW/EPNG/BR    
	  
Please give me a call if you would like to discuss the above prior to the meeting or if you would like to add additional topics.  We look
forward to meeting with you Monday, Dec 3rd in our office at 3pm.  Thanks, 

Greg Hills

If you have anything to add please do and send back to me. I look forward to seeing you again. As you know Transwestern was asked to buy the material and do the project for EOG. After saying this so you will know Transwestern ordered the material and most of it is in our warehouse in Roswell so we'll need to talk about this.  I didn't know about the material when you and I talked yesterday morning.

Material's that will be needed at the location to monitor and operate the facility. 

1.  Chromagraph
2.  H2O Monitor
3. H2s Monitor
4. EFM
5. Flow Control
6. Positive Shut In 
7. Flow Bypass

Please be advised that we successfully converted existing data and implemented the new contract/capacity release system for Transwestern last week.  With that, there is one change that will impact the Commercial group.  In the old CBS system, the Contract Admin group was responsible for identifying whether a contract was negotiated as a one-part or two-part rate.  Until a deal sheet is built and the new rates/revenue system is implemented, the Marketers will continue to update discounts in the existing CBS system under Negotiated Rates Maintenance.  

Additionally, the Marketer will be responsible for updating within the same rate maintenance screen the one-part/two-part flag for all new firm contracts under the 'reservation' charge code.  If a contract amendment requires a change to this indicator, this must also be captured; however, be advised that this field does not have effective dates.  Therefore, if the indicator is not applicable until a future date, the one-part/two-part flag cannot be updated because the current billing will pick up this change.  I will provide any additional training if necessary regarding the loading of rates/indicators.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

As a reminder, we have scheduled internal demos of the new system today at 1:30pm and 3pm as well as this Thursday at 1:30pm in EB3907.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

When we were talking with Steve and Michelle this morning I had forgottent that the Reliant mechanism is the Permian index minus SJ index minus $.10 times 50%.  That makes a big difference.  Please send me the whatever you have (I think Michelle had a spreadsheet this morning) showing the gross basis and the actual rate paid under the Reliant deal.  Also, if you know it what does forward basis for May look like on that deal?  FERC hasn't asked for this stuff yet, but they may and I'd like to start thinking about how we get this docket closed down.  Yesterday's order doesn't make the situation worse, obviously, but it also doesn't give any indication of this thing going away anytime soon either.  Please label anything you send me on this subject "Attorney Client Privileged."  Thanks. df

This is to respond to your question on TW/ Conoco at W-1. If Conoco has a line close to WT-1 or they are able to tie to WT-1, I would recommend that they should tie their line to discharge side of the WT-1 Compressor Station and not to the suction. A similar case was recommended to Duke a couple of months ago. The line pressure at discharge side of WT- 1 is 1008 psig.

Below are some notes taken while conversing with several TW customers on the 
various reasons prices have risen so dramatically out West.

El Paso line 1103 is still out of service from the August 2000 explosion.  
The remaining 2 lines are still operating at reduced flow levels taking 
200-300,000/d capacity off the market.

Storage levels in California were low to begin with.  With several coal and 
nuclear generation plants off-line (unplanned outages), the gas-burning 
generators have been running all out.

Northwest Pipeline has instituted several OFO's this month requiring shippers 
not to overpull the pipeline.  Penalty gas was selling for $22.00/MMBtu.

Beginning in November, SoCal Gas instituted its 5-day balancing requirement.  
This was not an unplanned event in the marketplace, however, it seems several 
entities were caught short early in the month and still haven't caught up.

LDC's east of California have experienced some dramatic weather but not 
severe.  They have been impacted more by firm demand to California knocking 
off IT and Alternate Firm supply destined for points east of California.  
SouthWest Gas has several alternate supply contracts with these LDC's and is 
collecting 150% of the market price from these LDC's by using SWG's full 
requirements contract on El Paso.

In addition, we now believe SoCal Gas is playing some storage games with the 
interstate pipes.  SoCal lowered their window on us for tomorrow to 580,000 
down from 750,000 due to "lower projected gas demand".  Sempra, Reliant, 
Dynegy, and Texaco are calling foul.  The thought is SoCal demand may be 
falling but instead of taking excess gas to replenish storage, SoCal is 
preventing higher-priced gas from reaching storage.

Subject:=09TW Expansion

There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the cl=
ose of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial tho=
ughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems. =20

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion=
? =20

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were cert=
ificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction i=
s that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an alter=
native to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements for =
the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are ex=
ecuted how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it =
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert=
. app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that g=
iven the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our abil=
ity to sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to =
sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contract=
s or a combination of both. =20

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options=
 (to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
=091.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (o=
r whatever number we decide on)
=092.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
=093.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
=094 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantl=
y this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels =
and fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for=
 1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve Stoj=
ic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated ra=
te options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach cou=
ld get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking ou=
r specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a=
 7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would =
be a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can t=
ell a customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by askin=
g for the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out=
 options of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this=
 is sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure. =20

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility =
do we have in structuring the options? =20

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose=
 to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want t=
o be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 a=
t $.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have =
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean =
we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a bet=
ter deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we deli=
berately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by off=
ering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and $.3=
5 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to =
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.           =20

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy i=
t the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, =
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d=
 of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 =
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who wan=
t option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That =
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand=
 first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else? =
 Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be=
 deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone =
may be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the=
 recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the=
 neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective nondi=
scriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh.=20

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answer=
ed already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are =
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your=
 convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get o=
ut and sell this stuff.  DF
    =20

As requested, Mark Baldwin has put together a summary of the Proposed Decision and Comment Points for filing on Friday.  Below are his comments which we can use for discussion purposes at the conference call later this morning.  Having reviewed the Proposed Decision I would agree with Mark's assessment in that while we may prefer that the Commission not modify the Comprehensive Settlement, overall the modifications made should not negatively impact Transwestern.  The Proposed Decision retains two important aspects of the CS for Transwestern:  1)  Unbundling of the SoCal backbone transmission system and receipt point capacity and 2) Retention of primary firm RP capacity of 750MM/d at Needles from Transwestern.  gh

Glen,

I have reviewed the 10/10/01 Revised PD of Comr. Bilas as requested. In view
of the entirety of TW's interest ,I still ascertain that TW can support the
current 10/10 PD. Noted below for your information and review is a summary
of the Modifications to the CSA that Bilas is currently offering :


1)Market concentration limits reduced from 40% to 30 % of available receipt
point capacity. TW has preferred no limits to market concentration
historically. However, as before, I do not believe pushing this issue will
be successful or productive for TW. There are no market concentration limits
in the secondary market. (Although Bilas warns market participants that any
misbehavior will be subject to CPUC investigation) P.44

2)SoCal will be required to make available on a daily basis any unutilized
firm RP capacity. I don't see any negative impact on TW, perhaps positive.
P.45

3)Price Cap for secondary intrastate market set at 120 % of SoCal firm rate.
This is the same cap that applies to SoCal. I don't like the precedent set
in this area, however it assures that the economic value allocation between
SoCal citygate and supply basin will proportionately tend toward the
interstate system providers in any tight transport/supply scenario. P.46

4)Not really a change , but Bilas mentions support for Hector Rd. as a
delivery/receipt at Ferc.

5)PD does not reduce the core's interstate capacity nor their storage
capacities but rather maintains these capacities at current levels. Current
level 1044 MMcfd, proposed 1000 MMcfd on the interstate system and current
storage 70 BCF, 327 MMcfd of injection and 1,935 MMcfd withdrawal Vs
proposed 55 BCF.  I see no clear negative impact on TW from this change.P.
52 &54.

6) CTA's (Core Transport Agents) allowed to reject only their prorata share
of non-reliability storage service. No impact on TW interests. P. 58

7) SoCal directed to present(via Advice Ltr.) how the cost of noncore
default balancing will be allocated ONLY to those noncore customer using
this service and not to the Core customers. I see no impact on TW. P.62

8)PD rejects the requirement that SoCal/SDG&E file an application with a
proposal to address core procurement function as the default provider.  I
see only positive attributes of this change for TW. P.63

9)Preserves the right for SoCal/SDG&E to seek recovery of expenditures
associated with the transfers of customers from Core to Core Aggregator. NO
impact on TW. P.66

10)PD orders a 10 % cap on ITCS (stranded cost)responsibility borne by
bundled core customers due to unbundled core interstate capacity. No direct
impact upon TW interest, however, likely a touchy point with noncore
interest. P. 75

11) PD orders that the core contribution to noncore ITCS will end effective
the adoption of the PD. Additionally, noncore customers to pay 50% of core
ITCS till the end of the core TW and EPNG agreements. No negative impact on
TW. Noncore customers bear additional expense. The PD estimates an
additional $18 million over next 5 to 6 years. P. 78 The PD provides an
estimate of increased stranded cost for the noncore between 01 and 06 to be
approx. $ 44.4 Million.

12) PD say NO to an increase in the core brokerage fee of $ 0.0039 (to $2.4
cents). No impact on TW interest. P.83.

13) PD treats Core Subscription service differently on an accounting basis.
No impact on TW. P.85-87

14)Generally, the PD makes some administrative changes to the small core/ESP
market rules and SoCal services and consumer protection implementation . NO
impact on TW interest. P 88-100.

15)Lots of tweaking on how SoCal can recover the cost to implement to
services envisioned under the CSA. Owing to the fact that SoCal has already
started to "implement" portions of the CSA and those cost are accruing to a
balancing account etc. Bottomline, not consequential to the approval of the
PD. No direct impact upon TW interest. P. 103-110.


On whole the centerpiece of TW's interest in this proceeding remains intact.
The SoCal receipt points are unbundled along with "SoCal backbone
facilities". TW has primary firm RP of no less than 750 mmfcd. Mojave is
recognized at only 50 mmfcd firm RP. No receipt point complex is given a
preference for capacity expansion. Line 235 appears to remain useful for TW
deliveries into the market load centers. The PD modifications to the CSA do
not impose upon TW any conditions or costs that would be reason not to
support the PD. The parties most affected by the PD are the core aggregators
with additional costs and restrictions to service options and noncore
customers with additional cost allocations.


Points for comments

1) TW agrees with the PD that the centerpiece of positive changes embodied
in the CSA in the creation of firm tradable RP rights. This change in SoCal
market structure provides all market participants with the proper tools to
build long term supply and transportation contracts.

2) Further adoption of the PD substantially reduces unnecessary market
inefficiencies at the California border by providing all market participants
with gas scheduling certainty.

3) The creation of tradable secondary rights on SoCal's intrastate system
will promote competition and generally lead to stable delivered gas prices.

4) The PD correctly observes that the PG&E market structure which relieves
upon an unbundled intrastate backbone system work "relatively well" during
California's challenging energy markets.

5)TW agrees that the time is ripe for approval of the PD. The energy markets
in California have been improving and stabilizing. The Commission promising
options are still valid in today's gas market. Further, SoCal is already
starting to follow the CSA game plan in their attempts to improve the
operating environment on the SoCal system. It is consistent to follow
through and make the structural changes required to make permanent these
improvements.

6)TW supports SoCal and others whom are approving this PD. (ON THIS POINT,
TW SHOULD BE SURE THAT SOCAL IS ON BOARD AS WELL AS OTHER CSA SIGNATORIES,
PRIOR TO FILING THESE TYPE COMMENTS)


I look forward to discussing these matters tomorrow on the conference call.

Mark, IGS.

You asked for quotes for:

Buying a call spread option for a SJ to Cal Border spread for Calendar 2002 
and 2003 at a strike price of $3.90 (spread exceeds $3.90)
-That was priced at $0.25 for 2002 and $0.20 for 2003.

Selling a put spread option, SJ to Cal Border in the same time frames at a 
strike price of $0.10 (spread drops below $0.10)
-This is basically worthless in that it is inside the variable cost.  

These quotes were from ENA on 1/9/01.

Call me with any questions.

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 2/1/2002 forward. 

A couple of things to note:
PG&E released two separate packages of gas for 25,000/day from Bloomfield to CA [one was at a fixed rate and the other is index based].
Socal indicated that the core customers they provided capacity via capacity release protested a ruling by the CPUC and won; therefore, these monthly prearranged releases are back on for now.  Because the decision came in late, Socal was not able to release for the full month of February.
ENA's capacity on K #24924 was again successfully released for February with TW collecting marketing revenues.

If you have any questions, please let me know.



 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

We have moved another change into production where any bid equal to over the 
max rate will be valued using a 0% throughput commitment.  This way, any one 
part and two part bid over max rate will be evaluated in the same manner.  
This also means that when a user checks the max rate button, a 0% throughput 
commitment will be assumed.

 <<New TW Consent.doc>> 
Michelle,
My regrets for the delay in getting this to you - however, prompted by the
comments supplied by your legal counsel, we've discovered, and are
verifying, that the first Consent to Assignment Agreement that we forwarded
to Lorraine referenced the WRONG Agreement - a possible mistake on our part,
and if it turns out to be so, something we regret happened.  Again, I will
confirm once my legal team confirms.

Instead, it has become (painfully) obvious that the Agreement that should
have been referenced in the Consent to Assignment document is the
Measurement and Control Facilities Operating Agreement dated February 12,
2001 between Transwestern and CPN South Point LLC ( now, Calpine
Construction Finance Company, LP as successor by merger to CPN South Point
LLC).  The New Consent provided above has been modified and we suspect that
no edits will be necessary: To confirm, South Point Energy Center, LLC will
be funded with assets transferred from Calpine Construction Finance Company,
LP at the closing scheduled for Oct. 18, 2001.  

Your facilitation of the Consent to Assignment is appreciated - pls. contact
me with any questions.

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail 
me if you have questions.

Thought you guys might find this chart pretty interesting.  USGT averages about 700,000 MMBtu per month, but as you can see it's highly variable.

Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  
Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and 
SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's 
posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput 
information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA 
how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part 
of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please 
reconfirm with other sources.

Attached for your review is a redlined draft of TW's Capacity Posting Procedure including changes suggested at our meeting yesterday.  One remaining item is to decide whether capacity available for "less than 5 months" or "5 months or less" will be designated as 1 day postings.  Please review and advise if you have any additional comments.  Thanks.

Jeff,

Per our conversation, attached is the Coral document we discussed regarding
the expansion of capacity by TW for delivery at Needles.  Let me know if it
needs anything.  I will fax it to you as well.

We sincerely look forward to working with you and TW in more detail on this

Attached below is a complete copy of the CPUC's Order on SoCal's RLS Tariff for peaking rates for bypass customers.  There are some differences in the final order as opposed to the proposed decision previously issued such as the addition of an interruptible rate.  In summary the Order contains the following provisions:

1.  Two rates were adopted.  A firm cost-based peaking rate and an interruptible peaking rate.

2.  The firm cost-based peaking rate will include the following components:
	a.  A monthly customer charge to collect the cost of customer-related facilities. 
		Actual rate will be dependent on type of customer ranging from $800 to $19,000.
	b.  A volumetric Public Purpose Program surcharge based on Commission approved rates.
	c.  A monthly reservation rate calculated using the currently authorized end-use customer class rate times the MDQ.
	

3.  The interruptible peaking rate has been set at 150% of SoCalGas' default tariff rate at a 100% load factor.

4.  Firm and inter. customers will pay a volumetric rate to collect the Interstate Transition Cost Surcharge, Sempra-wide rate charge
     and any other similar types of surcharges.

5.  Other provisions include: customers are subject to daily balancing, interruptible customers are not eligible for Service Interruption
     Credits and the tariff will apply on a facility-by-facility basis.

SoCal was ordered to submit modified cost-based tariff sheets within 10 days of the order (Due 8/12/01).  If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.  gh

El Paso Blanco Mis-Measurement - The 518,000 MMBtu of gas agreed upon in our 
settlement letter with El Paso has been paid back to TW as of October 25.  

Southwest Gas - SWG agreed to amend the start date of their transport 
contract to November 15.  TW resold the space along with an additional 1000 
MMBtu/d for a total of 15,000 MMBtu/d to Sempra Energy at $0.15 (slightly 
above market but equal to the rate SWG was originally paying).  Morgan 
Gottsponer sold Sempra the gas for this transport deal.

Burlington Resources' Val Verde Plant - We held another conference call with 
BR this week to finally resolve the outstanding issue of TW's obligation to 
take 250,000 MMBtu/d from Burlington's Val Verde plant.  Operational 
restrictions and San Juan temperatures seasonally affect the amount of volume 
TW is capable of receiving from Val Verde.  BR had claimed damages of nearly 
$3,000,000 from having to sell San Juan gas into less attractive markets 
because TW could not take all their volume.  

Upon investigation, there were actually very few days in which TW hampered 
Burlington's deliveries; but TW does have an exposure here for a contractual 
commitment that operationally we cannot meet on a year-round basis without 
spending several million dollars for additional compression.   In exchange 
for Burlington signing an amended operating agreement that meets both parties 
needs, TW has agreed to refund $100,000 of transport charges to BR for gas 
they moved this summer down the San Juan lateral.

Transport Options Program - Comments and interventions on this filing are due 
from interested parties by the close of business Monday October 30th.  

Duke Energy - We are working on a 100,000 MMBtu/d east-to-east transport deal 
with Duke beginning in January 2001 for one to two years at a rate of $.02 
-.03.  This deal would justify the capital expenditure to replace the coolers 
at WT-2 and give TW another 50,000 MMBtu/d flow capacity on the west Texas 
lateral.  However, Duke wants alternative flow capability west to the border 
at an incremental $.06.  As an alternative, we are proposing an index-based 
sharing mechanism for the west flow but Duke is balking (current market for 
calendar 2001 net of fuel is $.205).

As was foretold by some of the Kern expansion shippers, these shippers are justifiably angry about the way Kern has sold capacity in their open season, particularly as concerns shippers' access to markets on SoCal Gas through Wheeler Ridge.  However, what's even more encouraging here is to see that shippers are now validating the message TW embodied in its GIR proposal -- new market entrants should only have secondary rights to SoCal system capacity in instances where there is a capacity shortage.

Shippers Dispute Kern's Wheeler Ridge Sales
Chevron, Amoco Production, CanWest Gas Supply, Aera Energy and RME Petroleum have called on FERC to stop Kern River Gas Transmission from overselling delivery point rights at Wheeler Ridge into the Southern California Gas Co. distribution system. The Firm Shippers said in comments filed this week that, in a situation strangely similar to the recent El Paso capacity reallocation case, Kern River has oversold capacity at Wheeler Ridge, and its proposed expansion project will only exacerbate the situation (Docket CP01-31). 
On Nov. 15, 2000, Kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74,500 Dth/d of additional delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge into SoCal Gas. But Firm Shippers claim recent data provided by Kern and SoCal Gas indicates Kern River already has sold more than the 450 MMcf/d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into Wheeler Ridge. Firm Shippers told FERC. Kern River has sold 468.4 MMcf/d of capacity at Wheeler Ridge. 
Not true, says Lynn Dahlberg, Kern's manager of marketing. "We have to date subscribed at 450,000 dth/d. And unless we subscribe at more than 830,000 dth/d, we have not sold more capacity than SoCal has takeaway." The combined Kern-Mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600,000 dth/d, with Kern having 450,00 and Mojave 150,000. "We can move more than that capacity, and we have," she added. 
SoCal Gas has noted that it curtails nominations from Kern on a regular basis, Shippers said. With the proposed expansion project, Kern will be "creating the same type of firm delivery point over-sale situation that the Commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on El Paso Natural Gas at El Paso's SoCal Gas/Topock delivery point," they added. While they support the expansion, they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in Southern California degraded. They also complained that Kern's marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to Wheeler Ridge. 
Dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the Wheeler Ridge point, but "adding more players to Wheeler gives markets on SoCal more supply options. Shippers have to compete." 
The shippers are concerned, however that "substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to Kern River and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers...." The Commission should prohibit Kern from selling additional firm rights at Wheeler Ridge, or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity [emphasis added] that is of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers, they said.

Subject: Re: EOG Pronghorn Location  

Mike,

Boy, the more things change, the more they stay the same.... 

 You are correct that EOG does not give us the OK to "go ahead".  

EOG has agreed to wire funds to TW today to cover the cost of installing the 
EFM, quality monitoring equipment, and whatever additional cost we incurred.  
In typical EOG fashion however, they want everything done yesterday, after 
their actions delayed the activity by over a week.  To the extent we have the 
equipment available, and can install it, they would like to flow the gas as 
soon as possible.  Is it possible to hook up their well pending our securing 
all the equipment we need, or is the gas too bad to risk it?  They have gone 
ahead and told our Market Services people they are delivering the gas for 
tomorrow's gas day, and I suspect that is a little aggressive.  Do you have 
an idea when the gas will be available?

Thanks for your help, Bob

I realize we never talked about how the bids were stated - ours was inclusive of fuel and all variable charges. This will make a big difference in the ultimate rate to your shipper. Do you need me to break this out?

Notice Text:
All Shippers Letter #02-033
Date:=093/15/02
Time:=0911:00 a.m. MST

Subject: System Operations

The purpose of this letter is to inform Northwest's shippers of how it
intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by Questar Pipeline
at Clay Basin and by Transwestern Pipeline at its La Plata facilities.

Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from
April 2, 2002 through April 15, 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests
on April 16 and 17, 2002.  During this time Northwest will have no access t=
o
Clay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La
Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5,
2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.

During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compresso=
r
have exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in,
Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwes=
t
will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result
cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.

If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the
Questar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following
steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line
pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut
north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata
to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling
through Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries
from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate
confirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate=
;
and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.

If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do
not exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility
during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers can
help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule b=
y
securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson
Prairie storage during this work.

Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of
the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the
situation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system
restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest is
confident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the
Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.

If you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Services
representative.

Oneok will be handling these deliveries instead on Westex, effective January.  Do you have a copy of the original contract?

Subject:	Terminate CR 22017 Oneok Westex Transmission

We received a request from Oneok Westex Transmission to terminate FTS-2 Agreement 22017 effective January 1, 2002.  

 According to Butch at Westex, he thinks Energas will begin moving the volumes.  Can someone look into this?

Thanks,

David,
Legal reviewed your concern with referencing the upstream contract; and
they came up with the following paragraph.  One additional change, let's
use the word "discount" versus "credit"...this works better with our
tariff.  Let me know if this will work.  Thanks.

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide an
additional discount 
to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due
to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern,
rendering the supplies unavailable.  The additional discount will be an
amount equal to any quantities made unavailable multiplied by the
Discounted Rate.

David,
Here is Legal's spin on the amendment...can you guys work with this?  Do
you know the upstream contract number?  Thanks.

For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide a credit
to the Shipper for quantities that could not be scheduled hereunder due
to an event of Force Majeure, as reasonably determined by Transwestern,
on Contract No. ___ (upstream contract) rendering the supplies
unavailable.  The amount of the credit will be calculated by multiplying
the quantities made unavailable by the Discounted Rate.

Michelle,

Here is a quick paragraph that I think addresses the Force Majuere
issue.  Joe 
is out this afternoon and may inject his thoughts so let's touch base on

Monday.  Have a good weekend, I hope the dentist was kind!

Best Regards
David


7.	For the term of this Amendment, Transwestern agrees to provide a
credit 
to the Shipper for quantities made unavailable due to an event of Force
Majuere 
declared solely by Transwestern.  The amount of the credit will be
calculated 
by multiplying the quantities made unavailable by the Discounted Rate.

Capacity Marketing - TW sold 35,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Sempra 
Energy Trading at a negotiated rate of $0.50/MMBtu plus fuel for the two year 
period beginning January 1, 2004.  The path is from Blanco to SoCal Needles; 
contract value is $12.8MM.  In addition, Sempra waived its right to utilize 
its call option for 21,500 MMBtu/d of capacity at $0.30/MMBtu during this 
two-year period.

TW also sold 14,000 MMBtu/d of firm transport to Calpine for two years 
beginning Jan. 1, 2004 at a floating rate based on the difference between the 
California border and the San Juan Blanco indices.  The primary delivery 
point is Calpine's newly constructed power plant on the Topock lateral.  The 
floating price can currently be hedged to yield a gross margin of 
$0.80/MMBtu, with a contract value (net of fuel) of $6.1MM.

BP/Amoco was one of several interested parties last week as TW marketed the 
remaining large blocks of our East capacity.  BP has come back to TW with an 
offer, based on available space, of $0.02/MMBtu for demand plus a sharing 
mechanism for alternate deliveries west.  The proposed term is for 2001 April 
- October.  We are working with Facility Planning to determine the available 
space.

Gas Inventory - TW continued to experience high line pressure and pack out 
west this week.  This necessitated an additional sale of line pack gas of 
15,000 MMBtu for a gross revenue of $277,500.

El Paso Natural Gas Co. - Bids were due Monday (2/12) for the 1.2 Bcf/d of 
west capacity on El Paso.  They marketed the space in 5 blocks of various 
capacities;  minimum bid was 100% of the max California reservation rate for 
a minimum term of 1 month.  Market intelligence indicates over 144 bids were 
submitted for max terms of 5 years.  El Paso indicated the award announcement 
will be made the week of 2/19.  El Paso Merchant will likely exercise their 
ROFR right and take the space at max rates for 5 years.

3,000/day is being schedule at Wolf Creek and we are not receiving volume thus increasing Continental's imbalance.

Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled?

Attached are 250 and 300 MMcf/d cases to expand TW's mainline, Topock, and San Juan lateral.  These are + 30% costs but still based on the latest E&C estimate for Sun Devil.  If San Juan lateral is not expanded, then facility modifications and costs must be included for supplies to come from the east end which is not included in this study.

Keep in mind the cases including pipe loop used the smallest diameter pipe possible.  Therefore those cases can't be expanded above the 250/300 MMcf/d level easily.

If you have any questions, please call.

Per our Transwestern transportation agreement, North Start Steel would
line to change our delivery point from PG&E Topock - (POI 56698) on the
Transwestern Pipeline to CPN South Point (POI 78113) for 1,300 mmbtu
per day deliveries on or about May 7, 2001 or sooner or later, as
soonest this point becomes operational. This change will remain in
effect through May 31, 2002 gas day, which is the duration of the
transportation contract.

Would it be unreasonable to require one cent increments? If so, then I would 
recommend sticking with the tenth of a cent so as not to change too many 
things from our normal IOS. We all know what an issue even small changes tend 
to create.

Subject: TW IOS Posting PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL  

I've a couple of suggestions here.  First, given the excruciating experience 
we had last time with one-tenth increments, should we consider two-tenths 
(I'd like to use 1/4 cent increments but we're limited to 3 decimal places)?  
Secondly, I've tried to respond with a language fix for paragraph 5 
consistent with your concern of how to handle alternate rights.  Finally, 
I've done a little tinkering with the terms sheet.  Ya'll are free to do with 
these what you will.

Subject: Re: TW IOS Posting PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL  

Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last 
posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but 
omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).

My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand 
how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As 
currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on 
use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our 
granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do 
intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted 
rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  

If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much 
of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.

Any questions -- give me a call.

S.

The last "capacity available" analysis that I provided the group assumed that Red Rock would bring on 120,000 MMBtu/d of new West of Thoreau capacity beginning June 1st. Currently, construction delays are expected to result in 80,000 MMBtu/d being delayed until June 15th and 40,000 MMBtu/d being delayed until July 15th. Attached is my current estimate of West of Thoreau capacity available for June-August. Note that if we wanted to begin transport for our contracted shippers on June 1st, we would be short of needed capacity by 57,298 MMBtu/d June1-15 and 17,298 MMBtu/d July1-15. We need to discuss how this impacts our marketing strategy for June-August capacity.

Thanks,

Paul

Greg,
Just a note confirming our phone conversation.  TW offered a .05 fee for up to 10,000 effective 12/10 and a .08 fee for up to 5,000 effective 12/13.  These rates were applicable to Rides on our system with payback the following day.  Hope this helps.

NGTS, whose main headquarters is located in Dallas, has a one-man office 
located in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  John Rohde purchases gas from 30 
small to medium sized suppliers in the Rocky Mountain area and either acts as 
their agent or moves their purchased gas to markets for NGTS.  Most of this 
gas generally either goes to the Rocky markets or to Northern Natural 
pipeline.  NGTS holds CIG capacity, and I have encouraged John to look at any 
future potential of making deliveries off CIG into TW at Tumbleweed.  John 
also indicated that he thought NGTS does have some equity San Juan gas  which 
currently flows on El Paso to California via capacity release.   I will 
pursue this fact with the proper individual in the Dallas office.

Caithness - Confidentiality agreements were sent this week to the project 
developers of the 550Mw Big Sandy project in northwest Arizona.  Work 
continues on developing pipe lateral costs and environmental impact 
statements.

KN Energy - Their current transport contract to the West has a ROFR that 
expires 7/31.  The 20,000 MMBtu/d capacity is split evenly between Topock and 
Needles (KN is not currently flowing anything to Topock) at a rate of 
$.13/MMBtu.  Even with the Topock space, the total capacity could be worth 
something in the low to mid $.20's.  KN would also like to keep the ROFR 
language but this could only occur with a max rate deal for a term of one 
year or longer.  We should have any offer from KN by Monday 7/31.

Operations - we temporarily lost a compressor for approximately 1 hour at 
Station 2 on Thursday.  There was minimal throughput impacted.  An unusual 
"knock" sound has also been coming from one of the units at Station 4.  High 
western flow is taking its toll on equipment.

August Capacity - West demand is expected to be robust for August (higher 
than June) with high temperatures combined with lower hydro-generation 
capacity available from the Northwest (per CERA).

El Paso / Blanco Mis-Measurement - A letter was drafted this week for Stan's 
signature for delivery to El Paso's management.  The letter outlines the 
circumstances and chronology of events leading up to our meeting with El Paso 
in June.  The letter requests a payback of all the gas volume.  Stan has 
opted not attach a copy of the lawsuit filing to the letter. 

Reliant - Extended their Flex Firm (Primary Receipt and Primary Delivery at 
the West Texas Pool) from July to August 2000 for $.03, but increased volumes 
from 10,000 MMBtu/day to 20,000 MMBtu/day. 

ENA / Citizens Utilities - The new Citizens interconnect for the Griffith 
power plant was scheduled to be purged and filled with gas this week.  As 
manager of Citizen's transport agreement, ENA has notified us verbally they 
will request some or all of the 25,000 MMBtu/d of primary delivery capacity 
for that point.  As soon as we receive their request in writing, we will 
discuss strategy with legal and regulatory to evaluate all TW's options.

Duke Atoka-Crawford Proposal - For a $750,000 construction contribution from 
TW, Duke is willing to build out part of their gathering system to unload 
20,000 MMBtu/d off the Atoka lateral and re-deliver gas to TW's Crawford 
lateral.  TW would receive a 5 year FT at a rate of $.05 plus actual fuel.  
Oasis would be the primary delivery point.  This project has the added 
benefit of allowing TW to sell incremental space on the Atoka lateral.  

In addition, Duke is proposing to install additional compression to deliver 
up to 40,000 MMBtu/d of incremental volume to TW off the Zia plant.  In 
exchange, TW would provide a discounted $.035 IT transport rate for a two 
year term.  The Zia gas would flow through a new tap into TW's high pressure 
30" line.   This project has a fuel saving benefit to TW by eliminating one 
stage of compression from the low pressure system.

FYI 

In BP Energy's Red Rock contract #27609, BP has certain termination rights if TW defaults on certain obligations.  So that everyone is aware of the rights and obligations of both parties, they are stated below.


Transwestern must certify to BP by December 31, 2001 or such date as the parties may agree upon, that Transwestern has received acceptable licenses, permits (except air permits), approvals, right-of-way interests and utilities for construction and operation of the Red Rock Expansion.  If this condition is not met, or otherwise waived by the parties, BP shall have the right upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, exercised no later than sixty (60) days after December 31, 2001 to terminate the agreement.

Transwestern must certify to BP by March 31, 2002 that Transwestern has received acceptable air permits.  If this condition is not met, or otherwise waived by the parties, BP shall have the right upon thirty (30) days prior written notice, exercised no later than sixty (60) days after March 31, 2002 to terminate the agreement.

Please note the following request by Richardson to suspend another month of 
their contract for the month of August.  We will have to account for this 
contract suspension in the August forecast with an estimated loss of  
$116,203. 500  (35,700 MM/d * 31 days* $.105)

Dennis -   Our records indicate that the new terminate date should be 
4/31/02.  Let's discuss if you need some documentation to make the system 
reflect this termination date.  CS 

Perry - Please verify if your capacity sheets reflect this 4/31/02 terminate 
date as well.  Thanks.

We still need to bill Conoco the TCR II Surcharges on 20,000 MMBtu per day.  Maybe Michelle can get with Conoco and see how they want it billed.  If they want it billed on their new contract, maybe we can do an amendment.  If they want it billed on the old contracts, then you need to contact someone in the contract group to see how we bill it since the contracts are expired (i.e., overriding the CBS system or something).

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Per Perry's message below, we do have 33,000/d we can subscribe south of La Plata "A" to Blanco.  The only receipt point with available capacity to go with this transmission capacity is WFS/La Maquina.  Shippers that have scheduled volumes at La Maquina in the last 6 months are:  Vastar, BRT, WESCO, Texaco, Amoco, Southern Company & USGT.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Subject:	Re: Capacity South of Ignacio

There was a Burlington contract that I had in the tracker for 30 mmbtu/d from Ignacio to the I/B Link.  I have taken this 30 mmcf/d out of my files.  The line capacity south of La Plata A has been in the 700 mmcf/d.  Recent discussions have lead to a new lateral capacity revision to  705 mmcf/d, but the EBB posting was still using 700.  I have made the correction to the spreadsheets and the EBB to reflect the new increase in capacity.

In addition, the new available capacity on the EBB for the rest of 2001 is now 33 mmcf/d, south of La plata to Blanco Hub.   Call me with any questions.

Subject:	Capacity South of Ignacio

I would like to confirm the availability of 27,800/d of transmission capacity south of the La Plata "A" compressor.  It has been my understanding that the capacity of the facilities is 500,000/d through the La Plata "A" compressor south to Blanco and that the capacity of the facilities south of the La Plata "A" compressor is an additional 200,000/d south to Blanco, for a total of 700,000/d.

Northwest Pipeline holds 23,811/d of southflow capacity through the La Plata "A" compressor.  That is all of their southflow capacity.  So, TW has 476,000/d of capacity from La Plata "A" and the whole 200,000/d of southflow capacity south of La Plata "A" to sell.

I show that we have 476,000/d subscribed through the La Plata "A" compressor south.  I show that we have 172,200/d subscribed south of La Plata "A", leaving 27,800/d unsubscribed south of La Plata "A".  I understand that the capacity at the Red Cedar/Arkansas Loop receipt point is fully subscribed at 205,000/d (12,500/d Southern Utes, 125,000 Red Cedar, 13,500/d Texaco, 21,200/d BP Energy & 32,800/d NWPL), but the capacity that's reserved for NWPL at this interconnect is related to NWPL's northflow transmission capacity, so it should not be included in the southflow totals.

Therefore, I would like to confirm that there is 27,800/d of southflow capacity south of La Plata "A" that could be sold from a receipt point other than Arkansas Loop.  Basically, the transport would have to come from the WFS/La Maquina receipt point and deliver to either I/B Link or EP/Blanco.

Please let me know if you agree.  Ron, if you could assist, it would be greatly appreciated!

Capacity Marketing - SEMPRA renegotiated a firm contract for April-October 2001.  TW received an additional $.07 on 14,000 MMBtu/day for moving primary delivery POI from PG&E Topock back east to SouthWest Gas; incremental revenue was $209,720.

Sempra has also negotiated a true Daily Firm contract for the month of February 2001.  They purchased an additional 15,000 MMBtu/d to Needles made available by the higher window at SoCal and higher operating pressures on TW.   The volume will be index-priced daily based on volume transported.  Assuming all the volume flows, expected revenue could be in excess of $2,000,000.

Red Cedar - We are working with Operations and Facility Planning to coordinate the tie-in of the new receipt point in the La Plata Station yard.  All parties have agreed to the tie-in sometime between April 2 - 5.  We will provide the required notification to Northwest Pipeline once Planning notifies us of the estimated downtime and resulting cut in flows.

Project ___________ - TW's westward expansion moved into high gear this week as better project definition was achieved and groups began assembling data for the FERC application.  Filing is anticipated to take place mid-February.  Customer contacts were also made providing deal parameters to interested parties (response has been positive thus far).

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has requested a meeting with TW Operations for next week to discuss the appropriate facilities needed to meet our specifications.  We have worked with Field Operations and Facility Planning in identifying the appropriate people to attend.

NGPL  - Met with representatives this week to evaluate turning the existing Winkler interconnect back into a receipt point on TW's West Texas lateral.  The Marathon Indian Basin gas plant is expanding on NGPL and shippers are looking to move more volume to premium western versus depressed Chicago markets.  NGPL believes there is 50,000 MMBtu/d trapped behind the plant due to capacity constraints.  Ideally, they would like to move 100,000 MMBtu/d to TW.  NGPL will meet with interested parties to see if there is enough justification to set compression and sell the space on a firm basis.  Their timing, contingent on FERC approval, is 12 months which coincides well with TW's west expansion.

Following our meeting Friday, we propose to make the following assumptions 
for resubscription of capacity rolling-off in 2001 (Steve, please let us know 
if you would like to change any of these numbers):

     Assumption Current or Extension
Plan Capacity  Months  Rate  Rate &/or Volume

EOT to WOT 20,000 Feb-Dec $.15  (KN @ $.1310)
EOT to WOT 70,000 Nov-Dec $.15  (Agave @ $.14)
EOT to WOT 8,000 Apr-Dec $.15  (APS @ $.1520)

BL to TH 20,000 Dec  max  (Valero BL to TH @ max*)

EOT to EOT 10,000 Mar-Dec $.025  (Duke - Atoka @ $.02)
EOT to EOT 30,000 Apr-Dec $.035  (Continental 15,000 @ $.07)
EOT to EOT 25,000 Oct-Dec ??  (PNM @ $.11 - decide assumption by Wed)
EOT to EOT 400,000 Nov-Dec $.0075  (USGT @ $.0075)
EOT to EOT 40,000 Nov-Dec $.07  (Agave @ $.06)
EOT to EOT 20,000 Dec  $.02  (Valero TH to EOT @ max*)

IG to BL 18,000  Jan-Dec $.04  (Duke 18,000 @ $.03)
IG to BL 4,000  Feb-Dec $.04  (Vastar @ $.06)
IG to BL 15,000  Dec  $.04  (BRT @ $.05)

S. IG to BL 120,200 Jan-Dec $.02  (Red Cedar I/C:  Southern @ $.02, Red Cedar 
@ $.02)
S. IG to BL 32,800 Jan-Dec $.02  (La Maquina I/C)
S. IG to BL 26,000 Feb-Dec $.02  (Red Cedar I/C:  Vastar @ $.06)

We're assuming:
 Agave will extend their contract for 1 or 2 years.  Assumed extension rates.
 PNM will extend their contract, but probably at a higher volume and lower 
rate.
 Amoco will not reduce their MAXDTQ (6,500 IG to WOT, 3,500 BL to WOT).  Rates
  range from $.175 to $.205.

TW Negotiated Rate Filings - We were notified by FERC this week that TW's recent negotiated rate filings are on the docket for Wednesday March 28.  The possible outcomes include 1) approval of the negotiated rates or; 2) reduction of the rate down to TW's max rate and refunding the difference back to the shippers or; 3) acceptance of the rates but directives to modify all future negotiations to some form of more standardarized rate calculation.

Conoco -  The shipper missed its ROFR notification last month.  They hold 20,000 MMBtu/d from Thoreau to Needles expiring 04/2002 and 20,000 from Blanco to Thoreau expiring 03/2003.  We will post the capacity for five business days (ending Monday 03/26 at 5 pm) because the replacing contract is for term greater than 1 year.  If other shippers come in with a request during the 5 posting days, capacity will need to be prorated or allocated in a lottery.  If requests come in after the 5 posting days, the space is sold first come first served for max rate bidders.  Mavrix is requesting this capacity through 12/2004.

Alberta Energy Co. - AEC is Canada's largest gas producer and North America's largest independent gas storage operator.  Included in their storage facilities is Wild Goose Storage near Gridley, California (north of Sacramento).  They are currently connected to PG&E and are marketing an open season to expand the facility from 14 bcf to 38 bcf (in service date of April 1, 2004).  They are asking for minimum 5 year term commitments at rack rates awarded by net present value.  This may be an opportunity for Transwestern to indirectly have an option on storage or for Mavrix to directly lease storage.

SoCal Gas Needles Expansion - TW met with SoCal Gas in Los Angeles on 3/22.  In this meeting, SoCal Gas said it would be presenting a plan to management on Monday 3/26 to expand its Line 235 capacity at Needles by 50 MMcf/d.  The $2mm expansion requires the installation of a 1,000 hp electric compressor.  SoCal Gas intends only to notify the CPUC of its planned construction but will not seek CPUC approval to include the cost of these new facilities in rates.  SoCal Gas believes it can have the new facilities in place within 8 - 10 months.  TW will continue discussions with SoCal Gas to identify additional projects to further increase take-away capacity beyond the 50 MMcf/d contemplated in this first expansion.

Agave - TW and Agave field personnel are evaluating some valve and compressor reconfigurations that may allow Agave to move up to 60,000 MMBtu/d across the 10" LEC/Atoka line.  The changes would enable high pressure field gas to avoid being compressed into the low pressure side of the Atoka lateral.  We are also considering installing a tap and meter to move some Agave gas into the Duke/Crawford system.  Duke would then re-deliver the volume into the high pressure side of the West Texas lateral.  Because the gas would be moving off TW, into Duke, then back into TW, it could subject Duke to regulation under the Natural Gas Act.  Duke is aware of the risk and is evaluating their strategy.

Lone Star - LS Pipeline representatives were in the office this week in conjunction with Gas Fair.  We described the Red Rock project and the aptitude for producers on Lone Star to reach California markets.  Lone Star realizes they need to add compression to their system to access the West Texas lateral on a consistent basis.  They are evaluating their options, including selling some "under-utilized" pipe in west Texas.  They are sending us an updated system map to see if any asset synergies exist.

US Gypsum - USG' s energy management representatives from the Chicago headquarters came to Houston to discuss the Red Rock expansion.  The have four plants in California that consume a combined 11,000 MMBtu/d off SoCal and PG&E.  Their current transport contract with PGT expires April 2002 and they are evaluating options to source supplies from areas other than Canada.  They would like a portion of Red Rock but require Needles delivery capacity (which is fully subscribed through 2005).  They are very frustrated by the lack of response from their SoCal reps in coming up with a feasible solution to expanding Needles in the short term.  We told them we would keep them updated as our expansion conversations with SoCal progress.

Enron Energy Services - EES Corporate Development is evaluating opportunities to install small (50 Mw or less) distributed generation units in the western region.  They have identified TW's Kingman compressor station site as a strong candidate because of its proximity to gas supply, an APS electric substation, and abundance of available land.  Their goal is to have something operating before summer 2001.  They are reviewing environmental permitting requirements to see if fast-tracking the installation is feasible.

TXU - We negotiated an extension of the transport contract for 20,000 MMBtu/d for a 2 year term beginning April 1, 2002.  The path is Bloomfield to Needles.  This contract was done in lieu of the shipper exercising its ROFR option under the existing agreement.

Transwestern's average deliveries to California were 1120 MMBtu/d (103%), with San Juan lateral throughput at 861 MMBtu/d and Rio Puerco at 7 MMBtu/d.  Total East deliveries averaged 350 MMBtu/d.  

El Paso's average deliveries to California were 2071 MMBtu/d (71%) :
- PG&ETop, capacity of 1140 MMBtu/d, deliveries of 478 MMBtu/d (42%)
- SoCalEhr, capacity 1248 MMBtu/d, deliveries of 1055 MMBtu/d (85%)
- SoCalTop, capacity 539 MMBtu/d, deliveries of 538 MMBtu/d (100%)

Sorry, I was looking at the wrong row, BP's contract is 22,000/d (Sempra's contract with June 30, 2001 trigger is 30,000/d).

FYI,  BP's ROFR trigger on their 30,000/d Ignacio to Blanco contract was June 30, 2001.

Also, there is 15,000/d of unsubscribed, not subject to ROFR, Ignacio to Blanco capacity available for December, 2001 (just one month).  Since there seems to be some interest recently, I didn't know if we would want to go ahead and sell this now.

There's also 6,500/d of unsubscribed, not subject to ROFR, Blanco to Thoreau capacity available for December, 2001 too.

(Perry, This is what I have in my spreadsheet.  Please confirm these numbers for December 2001.  Thanks!)

Following up on my "To Do" from our conference call, the information below 
may be useful as we attempt to justify capital / operational expenditures on 
the TW system:

Objective:  Try and quantify in revenue terms the lost value of decreased 
west throughput to TW

First a few assumptions:
Fuel prices used were: Permian = $4.785/MMBtu and San Juan = $4.14/MMBtu
Baseload volume flowing west was assumed to be 1,090,000 MMBtu/d
Fuel consumed = 2%
Revenue impact is based upon current contracts and assumes lost fuel and 
commodity charges only.  TW continues to collect the reservation charges.

Result:
Based on current gas fuel prices, for every 1000 MMBtu/d delivery we lose on 
the west end, this translates to approximately $150/day of lost revenue.  If 
we assume the pressure drop at station 1 is preventing us from delivering 
25,000 MMBtu/d into SoCal, then the lost revenue for TW would be $3,305 per 
day or $1,206,000 per year.  To give you an idea of the significance of the 
fuel value, of the $3,305 daily revenue, approximately $3,072 of it is fuel 
related.

One More Thing:
We assume here that TW continues to collect the reservation charges.  
However, on a long term basis, if the west condition continues, we run the 
risk of losing the reservation as well.  Based on 25,000 MMBtu/d, this value 
equals $2,500,000 per year.

Let me know if you have questions.  I can be reached at 713-853-5559

Yesterday the Commission issued a draft order on Transwestern's request for rehearing in Docket No. RP00-249.  We had asked the the Commission remove the restriction on the months in which TW can acquire capacity on PNM.  The order reads, in pertinent part:

	At the present time, firm capacity is not available on PNM's system during peak periods, since all firm capacity on PNM's system is subject to recall by PNM in order to maintain service to core customers.  If in the future, however, circumstances change and Transwestern is able to acquire firm capacity on the PNM system which is not subject to recall or other prior commitment, Transwestern can do so.  Transwestern will be required to file a revised tariff sheet to reflect thte determinations made in this order before it can acquire such furm capacity during the peak period.

If you have any questions, let me know.

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory

4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.

Audrey,
Here's what I'd propose, but I'll predicate it upon the fact that I didn't 
have a personal hand in part of the transaction described here.  The 
USGT/Aquila deal is probably best reported together, but I'd ask that others 
in the group look at these Weekly Bullets and before Audrey commits them for 
Steve's approval, feel free to modify my verbage here:

USGT/Aquila Firm Deal
Transwestern sold 20,000 MMBtu/d of firm transportation from East of Thoreau 
to PG&E Topock for the period July - October at a rate of $0.17/MMBtu plus 
fuel.  The deal was sold in two packages, 5,000 to USGT (owned by Aquila) and 
15,000 to Aquila Trading directly.  

Sempra Energy Trading
Sempra exercised a contract right under its Gallup agreement to call on an 
incremental 21,500 MMBtu/d of firm capacity from East of Thoreua to SoCal 
Needles.  The term of the incremental firm transportation is from July - 
October at a rate of $0.30/MMBtu plus fuel.

FYI - I just reviewed the preliminary invoices for the global settlement contracts (8255, 20715, 20747, 20748, 20822, 20834, 20835, 21165, 21175, 25923, 25924, 26371, 26372, 26677, 26678) and the capacity release contracts (releasing and acquiring).  Everything looks good, including the necessary adjustments identified below.

If you need further assistance, please let me know.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	Transwestern Capacity Release Report for February 2002 Reservation Invoices

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Texaco K #25923/25924 Comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4.5% between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes, there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding.  Need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes; and if delivery makeup scheduled, then invoice should be adjusted accordingly.

Please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2/26/02.  I will review again on the 1st.  

Schedulers -  Please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [some contracts are based on calculations, especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage].

 << File: TW2002.02.XLS >> 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Southwest Gas - Conversations with SWG indicate that somewhere along the 
construction path for the interconnect, TW approved the installation of the 
meter bypass piping (we are waiting for engineering to confirm this).  If 
this is the case, we will ask SWG to install skillets or padlock the valves 
so it cannot be used without TW approval.  In addition, we are proposing to 
amend the start date of the SWG transport contract so that TW may resell the 
unused space in early November on a daily firm basis.  

USGT - US Gas Transportation is protesting the Market Center deal we 
negotiated during our brief September outage.  We re-negotiated the original 
invoice from $140,000 down to $113,000.  USGT has countered with $65,000 
citing mis-communication on the original deal.

Plains Farmer's Co-op - Higher gas prices have created an additional level of 
credit exposure across our customer base in terms of transportation 
balancing.  For September, this small Co-op had accumulated a balance payable 
to TW of approximately $440,000.  The customer indicated they would be 
sending us a payment of $250,000 but so far has only sent in $75,000.  Our 
credit department has demanded a Letter of Credit be put in place for 
$500,000.

The attached file contains a list of the variables we identified in our 
August 18th meeting.  I tried to break them down into smaller group just for 
organizational purposes.  The items under Prices and Temperatures should be 
easy to gather using the LIM database.  The items in the Other category may 
require more research.  What we have done in the past if we could not find 
the exact variable try and fine a proxy for it.  For example it may be 
difficult to find irrigation usage, but less difficult to find precipitation 
in a region.  Since these two items would intuitively seem to have an inverse 
relationship it may be possible to use precipitation as a proxy for 
irrigation.  After we have begun to research the Other variables we may have 
to come back to you and discuss proxy variables so keep that in mind.  We 
added a column for use to keep track of the statues on each variable this is 
just for us to keep track of where we found the variable or why we did not 
pursue it.  Let me know if we have missed anything or you have subsequently 
thought of anything not on the list.

Notes from Contract Administration/Marketing Discussion
April 25, 2001

Facilitator:	Dennis Lee
Attendees:
Elizabeth Brown
Michelle Cormier
Rick Dietz
Lindy Donoho
Kevin Hyatt
TK Lohman
Michelle Lokay

Contract Request Forms:

Requests for new service will go to Marketing.

Marketing will verify accuracy of request form to ensure that the following minimum requirements are met:
	Shipper Name
	Shipper Address
	Phone Number
	Fax Number
	State of Incorporation
	Type of Service (IT, FT, etc.)
	Quantity
	Contract Term (Beginning and end dates)
	Receipt Point(s) name
	Delivery Point(s) name

Amendments
?	Marketing will re-visit with Legal the issues regarding "stacked" amendments and capacity.
?	In order to facilitate changes in the system, Contract Administration will suspend using the amendment number on all amendment letters. (until the new contract system is in place).
?	Dennis and Michelle C. will look at internal procedures for amendments and modify as needed to facilitate process.

CAS
Dennis will work with Perry Frazier and Linda Trevino to develop a plan for CAS approval when Perry is not available.

Transactional Reporting

Marketing will provide a deal sheet on any new contract or amendment that is not at max rate so that contact administration can accurately produce the required transactional report.
Minimum information required on the deal sheet:
?	Contract Number (if known)
?	Rates (if one-part, need break down of Demand and Commodity.  (Rule of thumb is that commodity will be min rate and remainder will be demand.)
?	Alternate point information (if applicable)
?	Glossary of Terms (i.e. R01, R03, T01)
?	Dennis will provide updated Glossary of Terms

Tracking
?	Marketing will discuss tracking of contract from request through returned signed contract.
?	Contract administration has an internal form for individual contracts but does not track on a spreadsheet.

Contract Copies
?	Marketing will discuss whether copies are required.  
?	Josue will not make copies of entire contracts. 
?	On-line contract viewing capabilities through Envision are expected in the future.

Next Meeting
April 30 	EB 4103 @ 3:00


Let me know if I misstated any information of if there is anything I should add.

While the Transwestern Commercial group does not actively use these systems, I am not sure we want to delete them.  Can we save these on another server versus recreating them from scratch in the future?  Ben Asante has been providing support for us.

The question below was forwarded to me by Aquila.  The question (in red) is from PPL.  What would be TW's strategy and can someone get back with PPL?

Kevin, thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event PPL
opts to 
use it to meet any credit requirements.

I do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational 
sessions.  Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnect
with 
both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined based
on 
interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
pipeline 
about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded

questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm
deliveries 
from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
point 
to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas
on 
TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines. Sorry for the 
rambling question, but in valuating the asset, the question of
transportation 
inevitably comes up. 

Thanks
David

Expansion Firm Base Load Storage ("BLS") Service Open Season

Wild Goose Storage Inc. is planning to expand its facility located in Butte
County in northern California and connected to PG&E for service commencing

Working Gas Volume 			  14 Bcf			  38
Bcf
Maximum Injection Rate			  80 MMcfd		450 MMcfd
Maximum Withdrawal Rate		200 MMcfd		650 MMcfd

This open season provides for an in-service date commencing April 1, 2004
and an opportunity to participate in an "early service option" which could
have service available by April 1, 2003. The in-service date is subject to
CPUC approval by September 1, 2002 and the successful completion of new
facility construction.

Customer offers are required by 2:00 pm MST, Tuesday May 22, 2001

Customer offers must be reasonably open for acceptance by Wild Goose Storage
Inc. until 2:00 pm MST, Wednesday June 20, 2001 subject only to significant
changes in market conditions and final approval of customer's management.
Preference for offer acceptance will be toward longer-term contracts
(greater than 5 years) and offers, which exceed 100% of our rack rate. The
offer sheets are provided in Microsoft Excel and are set up to calculate the
percentage of rack rate for your convenience. It is the intent of Wild Goose
Storage Inc. to negotiate and conclude contracts with the participants
providing acceptable offers in this open season as close as possible to June
20, 2001. Wild Goose will announce to all contracted participants whether it
will proceed with the expansion in early August 2001. Wild Goose Storage
Inc. reserves the right to not necessarily accept the highest priced offer
nor to award all or any of the storage capacity available.

A reasonable summary of the main terms and features of BLS service is
attached for your convenience (Attached File - BLS Summary), but should not
be used as the sole terms by which service is to be provided. All service is
subject to the Tariff Schedules for Natural Gas Storage Service of Wild
Goose Storage Inc., as approved by the Public Utilities Commission of the
State of California.

For more information about Wild Goose Storage Inc. or to download a copy of
the entire tariff please refer to our web site at www.wildgoose-storage.com.

with the expansion, every effort will be made to complete construction as
early as possible. Notice will be given by November 1, 2002 if service will
be available earlier than April 1, 2004. All contracted participants will
have the right, but not the obligation, to amend their contracts to the
earlier term start date and add this additional service to their existing
contracts at the same fees negotiated for the first year of service
commencing April 1, 2004.

The Newark Group has withdrawn its bid for 800 MMBtu/d Needles expansion.  (After looking at the contract I sent to them, it appears their lawyers had red-lined the entire agreement and that for such a small volume it wasn't worth it!)  Not a big deal, but how should we proceed with awarding the 800/d?  I think BP would take it or maybe Oneok.  What do ya'll think?

Transwestern is seeking your assistance in conducting a workshop on its 
proposed Transport Options Program.  We are asking a small group of our 
business partners representing a cross section of Transwestern's customer 
base to help us resolve some of the remaining details of the program.  During 
the 2-hour workshop, Transwestern will attempt to answer questions raised by 
its customers following the original rollout of the program a couple of weeks 
ago.  It is hoped that following the workshop, we can put the finishing 
touches to a service offering that merits the support of those involved in 
the workshop group as well as the FERC and Transwestern's shippers.  We ask 
that you send both a commercial representative as well as a regulatory or 
legal representative in order that we can address the full range of issues 
affecting this proposed filing.  Below are the details of the meeting:

Double Tree Hotel
400 Dallas Street
Houston, TX  77002
(713) 759-0202

Meeting Room: Fannin Room, 2nd Floor
Date:  Thursday, August 31, 2000
Time:  2:00 - 4:00 p.m.
Coffee, soft drinks and snacks will be provided

RSVP your company's attendance by telephone or Email to Jeff Fawcett at 
713-853-1521 or jfawcet@enron.com.  Your company's participation in this 
workshop will be greatly appreciated.

Our Commercial group has definitely used the Deal Analysis system!  The 
reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent 
transporting deals on Transwestern.  For example, we executed a one year deal 
for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million 
gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California 
border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11 
months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully 
this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.

Michelle, I am trying to get some quantification of actual benefits (in terms 
of $'s saved or loss avoided) of your use of the model.  Could you give me 
some feedback before Tuesday, as Phil Lowry is asking about use and actual 
benefits of this model.

Thanks

Kim

FYI!

TW Operations have been running pigs from Station 9 to P1 and from P1 to P2.  176 barrels of water have been received at P2.  Large amounts of water are beginning to show at P3.  The field has planned to run pigs from P2 to P3 today or tomorrow.  Owens Corning is on this leg between P2 and P3 and because of the large amounts of water they may be shut in for one day.  This POI pulls 3,200 mmbtu/day and TW is working with Owens.  Entergas may serve them for one day.

Although I have turned over the capacity tracking spreadsheet duty to 
Michelle (who has eagerly accepted), I still maintain another spreadsheet of 
the long term FT agreements which the options are tracked on.  It might be a 
good idea for the transport options to be tracked on both spreadsheets.

Option to suspend contract for up to 3 months/year.  Request must be provided 
to Transwestern 5 days prior to the end of month preceding the requested

written notice at least 6 months prior to the expiration of the priamry term, 
subject to available capacity and provided TW and Richardson are able to 
agree on trasport rates to be charges.

Current expiration date is 4/30/02.

As we discussed in staff meeting this morning, please provide me with a 
summary of any type of transport options imbedded in your assigned customer 
accounts' contracts (i.e., contract #, Shipper name, explanation of option, 
term of contract, term of option, how much advance notice to trigger the 
option, etc.).  I will incorporate these transport options into a capacity 
spreadsheet which will be forwarded to our group.

Please try to forward this information to me at your earliest convenience.  
Thanks.

The attached brochure is pretty good reference material for the project.  
I've asked these guys to freshen up the status.

According to Jeff Dasovich, the CEO of Sempra has referred to the project 
publicly as a "bypass pipeline."  The pipe will drop down through Imperial 
Irrigation, follow the border on the Mexico side, go through Mexicali and 
serve the new Sempra LDC there, go back across the border to south of San 
Diego to the PG&E's Otay Mesa IPP, then proceed on to Rosarita.

As we discussed, the "genie is out of the bottle" with respect to all future 
bypass projects in California.  The only significant opposition that could be 
mounted here is the CPUC and/or other customer groups like TURN or ORA 
bemoaning the project's "cherrypicking" of gas loads.

This is the final OBA letter that we should be using to terminate the volum=

Subject:=09TW OBAs Calling for Volumetric Settlement

Lee, as I mentioned on Friday, the purpose of the attached letter is to ter=
minate the volumetric OBAs and revert to the tariff OBA to avail ourselves =
of the "hammer" in Section 4(b) of the tariff form (Sheet 147) which permit=
s us to credit the operators' scheduled volumes to the imbalance, ie, confi=
scate their gas.  I'm told that the subject OBAs were individually negotiat=
ed and deviate from the tariff in one way or another.  They also said that =
these OBAs allow cashout, but don't require it, and that's the problem:  Th=
e operators are not voluntarily paying back the gas because in many locatio=
ns (ie, San Juan), the pipeline is full and they don't want to short their =
markets.  Because I haven't seen any of the agreements that we propose to t=
erminate (the TW people have just finished briefing them), I told the group=
 that an attorney needs to look at each one to make sure that we cannot, in=
 fact, force cashout.  In most of them, I'm told, cashout is at the option =
of the party owing the imbalance. =20

As I also mentioned, this letter is a template; a starting point.  It must =
be tailored to each OBA being terminated. For example, the Section numbers =
are not filled in, and must be supplied. You will note in the second paragr=
aph of the letter that we say, essentially, that in capacity-constrained ar=
ea, if volumetric settlement is to occur, it will need to be accomplished t=
hrough crediting their scheduled volumes to the imbalance.  From my convers=
ations with TW, my understanding is that most of the volumetric OBAs do not=
 have a provision expressly permitting us to do that.  Indeed, as I mention=
ed above, that's my understanding of why we're terminating the volumetric O=
BAs.  Even if there is no provision in the subject OBAs for crediting sched=
uled volumes, my opinion is that we can offer that as an option, because th=
at is still a way of balancing "in kind", but omit the reference to the agr=
eement (as I have noted with brackets).  If they don't want to do that, cas=
hout is the only other option; that's our way of forcing cashout. =20


Thanks for your help, and if you need help, you might ask Maria or Dari.  H=
owever, I don't envision that it will take much time to do any one letter..=
...............Tony

Jill, I need to revise one of the guarantees that were forwarded to you on 10/11/01. The date of agreement and termination date for the Mavrix guarantee (legal #2854) has been changed to :
Date of Agreement = 11/1/01
Termination Date = 9/6/01
The parties agreed to terminate the agreement before the effective date of agreement. If you have any questions, please give me a call @ 402.398.7155.

Julie - we can assign a centrex line (713-750-xxxx) number for him.  I will have to order call notes from SWB (monthly charge) on this for his voicemail.  This will work totally different from the Lucent phone with it's only feature being call notes.  Please be sure Eric understands this.  I'll let you know the due date this will all be completed.  It will probably be another 5 working days to get the order completed by Bell.

Let me know if you have any questions.   I apologize for the delay...this request did not make it to my group.

Along the same lines, we could possibly do an EFBH deal with BRT for a portion of their 80,000/d SJ - EOT deal (DP's to WTX).  Again, I'm sure they would argue the obligation to flow warrents a reduction in their rate, but we could look at the economics compared to the cost of facility modifications.  Over the last year, BRT hasn't scheduled less than 70,000/d on average under that agreement.

What if we could contract with Agave under the EFBH Rate Schedule for gas from Red Bluff & Bitter Lakes (located north of WT-1 & south of P-1) to deliveries off the south end of the WTX lateral?  Then we could sell westward capacity through WT-1 under Rate Schedule FTS-3.  Agave nominates a total of 50,000/d to 60,000/d from these supply sources into the Central Pool, but this gas does not need to flow through WT-1.  Maybe Agave's existing 40,000/d East could be done under EFBH (if Agave didn't want to commit to incremental firm), but they would have the obligation to flow - I'm sure they would think that merits a rate adjustment.  Anyway, it could be cheaper than some of the options we discussed yesterday or it could be something we would want to do in addition to modifications to WT-1 (for Red Rock & PNM deals).

Kevin, let's get together Monday so I can fill you in on the status of WT-1 capacity.

Michelle sent me the attached (different version) this morning for approval 
where she changed the first paragraph.  I've reviewed the original version 
Susan Scott just sent as well.  It appears that most of the changes were just 
spelling out "Transwestern."  I am ok with both versions as long as we have 
the July, 2000 date correct.  Please send me the final version that goes out

Michelle, as I mentioned in my voice mail, the other lawyers wanted a few 
changes.  My sincerest apologies for the confusion.  Apparently you and I 
were actually working off an old version of FGT's letter, not the one they 
ultimately approved and used.  Since you are out of the office, I've taken 
the liberty of forwarding it to Carl without you reviewing it first, since I 
know we want to mail this out soon.  

Carl, Michelle advised me that EOL's lawyer had approved the previous version 
so I assume they will want to review this one as well.  Let me know if there 
are any concerns.

Thanks!

Subject: So Cal Edison Claims Withholding of Pipeline Capacity

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

"[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants," Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. "No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time."

FYI--Below is the Press Release regarding Com. Bilas' resignation from the CPUC for health reasons.  With the upcoming elections, appointment of a new Commissioner will most likely become another campaign issue for discussion.  gh

PUC Commissioner Richard A. BIlas RESIGNS
	Commissioner Richard A. Bilas of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has resigned from the PUC, effective at the close of business on March 8, 2002.  
	In a resignation letter to Governor Gray Davis, Commissioner Bilas said that concerns about the health of himself and his wife have made it impossible for him to adequately and effectively serve as a Commissioner.  "I am thankful for having been able to work in a policy making position in California," said Commissioner Bilas.  "I hold only good memories of the experience."  Commissioner Bilas' term was set to expire on January 1, 2003.
	Fellow Commissioners expressed comments on Commissioner Bilas' resignation: 
"I enjoyed working with Commissioner Bilas and I wish both him and his wife well," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC. 
	"I'm sorry to hear of the Commissioner's resignation," said Commissioner Henry Duque.  "He has been a great asset to the Commission, and I will miss him."
	"I am sorry to hear of Commissioner Bilas' resignation," said Commissioner Carl Wood.  "I wish him and his wife good health."
	"I am sorry to see Commissioner Bilas leave," said Commissioner Geoffrey Brown.  "He was a major force on the Commission.  His intellectual critique was always brilliant and he will be greatly missed."
	Commissioner Bilas was appointed to the PUC on January 1, 1997, by Governor Pete Wilson.  On February 1, 1998, he became Commission President and served in that capacity until March 2000.  
A biographical sketch of Commissioner Bilas is available on the PUC's web site at: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/static/aboutcpuc/commissioners/bilas/index.htm.

Thank you,
If we would rather not participate in Transwestern's 50/50 sharing
mechanism; if we were to re-market the capacity, I'm assuming that this
would be ok with you?  I don't think we would need this option.

Corny

The attached is a report from the Zai*Net system showing any physical contracts we have that contain embedded derivatives.  Just to be sure that the system is 100% complete, I am asking that you compare the attached list with your records.  If you have any Index related transport or fuel deals that are not on the list, please provide me with the contract number, start & end date, volume, Index(es), deilvery (and receipt) point, counterparty name, and any adjustment to the index value.  I am only looking for contracts that were effective on or after 1/31/2001.   Please let me know by Friday, June 15.

Thanks!

*****  Attention Remote Access Users - Important Update  *****

There is now an interim solution in place for your remote access needs.

Please use 713-440-4221 or 866-295-3813 for dial-up access.

Windows 2000:

VPN access for Windows 2000 is fully operational.  Either the VPN without iPass option can be used, or a connection may be created manually using the same settings as VPN without iPass.  For users who are dialing in, creating a Dial-Up connection using either number listed above with the default settings will work.  You must be sure to append the domain name to the user id (i.e.. CORP\rbarker) for the connection to be successful.

TK, 
Just spoke with Greg Hathaway with Virginia Power regarding a Ride at the Panhandle point.   He wants to Ride for 12/13 for 5,000 MMBTu to Park on 12/14.   I quoted him $.08, but he insists that you previously did a deal with him for $.05 and would like to do this at $.05 as well.

Let me know.  Thanks.

to possibly take Wednesday off if I can shift my meetings.  Let me know if 
there's a conflict.

If everyone else is ok, I can be however, I believe the tariff does not grant 
these alternate point rights and by just adding we could be sitting a 
precedent.  especially in regard to outside the path.   MK

Subject: Re: revised language  

Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all 
bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.  They are deemed to be on 
notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they 
wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and 
alternates, they could have done so.  None of them did, and most importantly, 
the winning bidders did not.  Our letter agreement simply memorializes that 
we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or 
alternates.  I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get 
it nailed down?  DF

Subject: Re: revised language  

I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in 
the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that 
the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed 
to.   My concern with adding the language below is,  could it be argued that 
not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just 
stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different 
rate??

After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined

negotiated rate agreements we've done.  If there are any objections you need

Subject:	EAMR Interconnect and Measurement Services

John, Kevin, Jeff, and Steve,
After yesterday's Marketing Roundtable meeting, I have given further thought to the idea of interconnect services for customers that would bring lower costs by avoiding the contribution in aid of construction and possibly other markup fees that the pipelines are required to charge.

Attached is a strawman of how this might work.  

 

Please take a look at the document and "tear it apart."    The more vigorous your analysis the quicker we will know if this is a concept worth pursueing further.
Also, do any of you have a sample deal currently on the table that we could test this concept on?  

Best regards,
Sarabeth

to increase firm at Pengilly from 12 mcf/day to 210 mcf/day.   The first=20
estimate for $85,000 consisted mostly of contract labor with field personne=

performing a pressure test to upgrade the MAOP.

Milbank Project
Continued gathering data to model the Milbank system as it is today.

Melbourne #1 - Project Release
The Melbourne #1 TBS Mods project was released to Engineering.   The projec=
t=20
consists of TBS mods to support the increase of firm from 330 mcf/day to 50=
0=20
mcf/day at Melbourne. Presently the Marshalltown B/L is constrained and cou=

Adel #1A TBS Mods - project release
The Adel #1A TBS Mods Project was released to engineering.  This project wa=
s=20
a result of the customer wanting to convert an existing IT load at Adel #1A=
=20
to a Firm load.  The new Firm load will be 1400 mcf/day.   The project has =
a=20
targeted Nov 30, 2000 in-service date.  The station will have a new meter=
=20
installed along with piping size modifications.

Ethanol Injection
Reviewed and researched (for Marketing) the possibility of injecting Ethano=
l=20
into the pipeline for a possible "Green Energy" rating and as a means of BT=
U=20
enhancement.  Since ethanol would remain a liquid at any normal pipeline=20
conditions, even atomizing the ethanol at the point of injection would not=
=20
insure the Ethanol from liquefying, dropping out and collecting into the=20
pipeline low spots.  Also, there were many issues concerning possible liqui=
ds=20
entering the fuel systems of our equipment and other customers=01, equipmen=
t. =20
Planning recommended that this project not be pursued.

Researched (for Marketing) was the possibility of burning a Methane/Ethanol=
=20
mix in our equipment (i.e.: Turbines) in order to receive a "Green Power"=
=20
rating.  Solar was contacted concerning the possibility of "co-burning"=20
ethanol and methane.  As a manufacturer they said they would be willing to=
=20
work with us, however, they only recommended it if it were to be a constant=
=20
fuel source.  Solar said there would be considerable fuel injection system=
=20
retrofits required.  Also, if this were not a constant fuel then there woul=
d=20
have to be two separate fuel systems (co-burn and methane only) and a=20
complete fuel control system change.  With all that the project has been=20
deemed cost prohibitive.

Vapor Injection of Propane (VIP Service)
Research was started for Marketing into the possibility of injecting=20
vaporized propane into the pipeline as a way of increasing capacity during=
=20
peak days.  Upon initial review many questions were generated by the planni=
ng=20
team concerning specific requirements of the new service (i.e.: # of days/y=
r,=20
firm, daily firm etc.)  Planning awaits feedback from Marketing before any=
=20
more action is taken.

Electric Generation=20
Proposal was reviewed for Marketing from APA for an engineering study to=20
review the possibility of utilizing stand-by generators as electric produce=
rs=20
for the Utilities during peak power times in the summer months.  A few=20
discrepancies were found and are being worked out before APA can be release=
d=20
to complete the engineering study.

Beaver Dehy
A request was received from John Sturn of the optimization team to review t=
he=20
Capacity of the Mole sieve Dehy system at Beaver Compressor Station on the =
SE=20
24" line.  Beaver is considering a capital project to re-route the dehy=20
system that is currently piped into the suction of the station to the=20
discharge, thus increasing the capacity. =20

Cogentrix Power Plant
Three detailed cost estimates for the Cogentrix Power Plant proposals were=
=20
prepared and forwarded to Marketing.  The details of the cost estimate=20
included a breakdown of costs for:
Material Costs
Labor
Freight and Taxes
Surveys/Permits
Construction Support
District Labor
Engineering/Drafting/As-builts
Contingency
Overhead
AFUDC
The break down of costs was done for the Sheldon, Lehigh, and Raun projects=
=20
in Nebraska and Iowa.

Cherokee Ethanol Projects
Seven sites were examined for a proposed ethanol plant in Cherokee County,=
=20
Iowa.  The delivery volume was for 8 MMCF/D at a delivery pressure of 70=20
psig.  It was assumed for this study that the initial load would be for 4=
=20
MMCF/D for two years and then increase to the 8 MMCF/D level.  The cost=20
estimate assumed that the initial design would be for the 8 MMCF/D.  This w=
as=20
done to reduce the cost for the project.  Each cost estimate was done for a=
=20
firm transport level and an interruptible transport level (14 cost estimate=
s=20
total).  Two of the sites are on the C line approximately 10 miles southwes=
t=20
of the Paullina Station.  The remaining sites were on the Storm Lake/Lytton=
=20
Branchline.

Joe,
Here's the final version for your approval and execution.  As we
discussed, if possible, we need you to execute and return via facsimile
a signed copy as soon as possible this  morning.  You are the last
contract to get signed here and we are at the deadline to authorize G.E.
to proceed on the turbine production schedule today.  Also, look for a
facsimile from me that has the form Transportation Agreement attached.
You'll need to sign that and return it along with the Privileged and
Confidential Agreement.

I know we were diametrically opposed on a couple of issues here, but I
genuinely appreciate your professionalism and commitment to see this
negotiation through to a successful conclusion.  Thank you.

Regards,

Jeff

We have established a new FT in CBS (CR 27698) to track capacity availability due to the Red Rockl Expansion.  We would like to execute the agreement in CBS so the volumes can be sent to CAS.  

Please note this contract is for administrative purposes only and should not be invoiced and should not be included in any reporting.  If there are no concerns, I will activate this contract tomorrow morning (10/30/01).

Dynegy: Enron a 'Model Competitor'
It doesn't happen very often, so we're noting an apparently spontaneous comment from Dynegy Counsel Ed Ross at a FERC Roundtable last week that one of his chief competitors, Enron, "has done an excellent job of being competitive." He suggested others could look to Enron as a "model competitor. They've done a very good job of setting up a strong financial desk and a strong physical desk and we don't see any problem with it. I think they have set up their books in a way that they truly have separation between the regulated and unregulated aspects of their business." 
Ross had prefaced the remark, midway through a heated debate on affiliate abuses, with the comment that "this is not an industry-wide problem. I believe there are good and bad players in the market today." 
Earlier, Enron's Leslie Lawner had invited "all of you to spend the day on Enron's trading floor, because I assure you, you will not see a more competitive environment anywhere. There is no way these folks, who fight like cats and dogs among themselves, would voluntarily transfer value to the pipeline group for the good of the bottom line." Lawner had to quickly back off the invitation - mentioning confidentiality restrictions - when it appeared about half the room was ready to troop over to the trading floor.

Here is the status of all outstanding long term contracts:

Duke - 5 year, 20 MMcf/d EOT contract.   Currently routing.  Will probably 
receive Presidential approval either Friday or Monday.

Red Cedar - Contract has been with Red Cedar since September 7th.

Sempra - Option to call upon 21,500 Dth/d of EOT to Needles capacity was 
elected August 24th.  I am tired of nagging.  We need the request form to 
begin the deal process.

Sorry about my incomplete memo (I hit send instead of save).

Anyway, we would like to set-up a two hour meeting for Thursday, August 3rd 
to discuss the variables for modeling westward throughput on TW (to forecast 
fuel).  This will be a brainstorming session to discuss the various impacts 
on the level of throughput, such as, hydro levels, weather, prices, 
seasonality, etc.  Please let me know if morning or afternoon on the 3rd is 
good for you.

Thanks,
Lindy

Kim-

Listed below are the issues, pretty much as written, in the meeting on the West Texas Leg.  Some are self-explanatory while others are somewhat cryptic.  I will follow up with a list that better defines each issue, and you might have your guys think about each as well.  We'll get back together soon (I'm not sure I can do it this week), and discuss an action plan.

-	CS 9 fuel
-	Atoka Lateral 	We have both supply and market opportunities within the lateral itself
-	Turbocharge the Atoka #3 units
-	Look at Zia pressure obligation on the contract
-	Agave replacement gas at Atoka #3
-	Complete the loop between WT-1 and WT-2
-	Coolers to WT-2
-	Pecos compressor re-wheel and engine upgrade
-	200 	300 (WT-2 to Pecos) flow study
-	Look at Block Valve 16 bi-directional interconnect w/Sid Richardson, and ability flow incremental above 340 on the total system
-	Look at Keystone into NNG; back to TW south of WT-2
-	Check pressure of Stations 6 & 7, and PNM receipts
-	MAOP restriction on Panhandle leg due to encroachment

Let's talk.

Thanks,

MG

The idea behind this tool is to help us track in writing the multitude of 
work we need cost estimates on.  The form is ours and we can update it as 
needed.  Let me know if you have questions or concerns.

Michelle,

Further to our conversation of last  Friday, could you please verify if we 
are meeting at 1.30 pm or 1 pm tomorrow. 
Tomorrow in the meeting we will explain you the process that needs to be 
followed in order to launch Transwestern products on EnronOnline. It may also 
be a good idea to have your legal person present in the meeting so that they 
can  also understand the process.

Regards
Naveed Ahmed

Good morning ladies,
Just wanted to ensure that this current discussion with Bevin is resolving
the Performance Bond issue which you had mentioned to me - If so I can step
out and leave you in Bevin's good hands.  For my own information - because I
haven't dealt with these details before - is a Performance Bond needed in
addition to this agreement?

Lorraine,

Thanks for your suggestion in looking for it internally here.  It's a hit
and miss when it comes to getting anything from Chad since he's always on
the road.  Attached is what he sent.  I just figured it would be easier to
get a TW Ft agreement from TW.  I assumed wrong.

Hopefully, we can get the credit issues resolved.

Bevin

In preparation to present offers to APS, Duke, and Panda, the following tasks need to be completed-

James, Teb, Blair to calculate rates for $911 MM facilities according to the following guidelines-

- Rate matrix based on contract terms of 15/20/25/30 years 
- Project depreciation consistent with contract term
- Segmented rates (max rate)
- Levelized
- Volume allocations: SJ-780k/d; Cal Border-330k/d; Phoenix;500k/d
- Incremental O&M costs charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; O&M costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.
- Incremental fuel retention charged to new shippers prior to next rate case; fuel costs re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.
- Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $25 MM change in cost of new facilities
- Determine rate sensitivity (for 15/20/25/30 year terms) assuming +/- $2 MM change in O+M re-allocated based on expected outcome following next rate case.

Kevin to provide capital structure and cost of debt, cost of equity (in light of recent circumstances) in support of new rate analyses.

Eric, Kevin, Lorraine and Michelle to outline commercial transaction structures for APS, Duke, and Panda.  Eric to schedule meeting to discuss rate indexation.

Eric to schedule next team meeting asap (target=Nov 1).

Thank you.
