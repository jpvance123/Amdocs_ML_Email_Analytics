Kevin, this presentation has been revised (we explained to her that the
other one was too much about what they are doing and their exclusive
license, and that it needs to be more practical and topical to apply to the
audience that will be in attendance.  They have a client as well that could
participate. Please review the information and let me know what you think.  

Thanks Kevin!

Subject: Starline Presentation Proposal
Importance: High


Good afternoon Mike,

As discussed, below please find a revised idea of the presentation we would
like to give at the Gas Infrastructure show. We would like to do a dual
presentation where Ted Fiala, our director of new technology, presents the
starline process and then is followed by a presentation by Mike Beezak of
Philadelphia Gas Works, who has used the starline process many times. Mike's
presentation would be a high-level case study of how PGW arrived at the idea
of using the technology and how it worked out.

We are currently working out the details with Mike and will be able to
provide you with the presentation prior to the show in march to ensure it is
suitable. 

We are extremely interested in introducing this new technology to the gas
leaders that will be present at the Gas Infrastructure Conference and
sharing our utility experience.

Thank you,

Kevin,

Thank you for your reply. To answer, the service is designed for multiple
users over an intranet connetion. The more users, the lower the cost per
user.  If it's just for you, we can work out a price that's reasonable for
your budget.

Let's discuss this. My phone number is 713 349 8281. Please call or reply by
email to set up a conference call. Thank you.

Steve,

Mixed signals from APS today.  We told them that we were keen to deal but needed commitment.  They are firmly sitting on the fence.  They did encourage us to do a deal with KMI.  I offerred to form up a study effort with them since they would be a crucial shipper.  They have to go away and have a think.  Their key decision maker did not show which is not a good sign.  They do have a 500 MW project in development near Las Vegas, which may present an opportunity.

Actions
-I need to talk to Tom Carlton, their decision-maker.
-Kevin needs to bird dog the folks we met with today.
-You should definitely stay engaged with KMI to see if we can do a deal.
-Kevin needs to set up meetings with DUK, PGE, SEM during first week of December.

Kevin, thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event PPL
opts to 
use it to meet any credit requirements.

I do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational 
sessions.  Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnect
with 
both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined based
on 
interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
pipeline 
about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded

questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm
deliveries 
from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
point 
to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas
on 
TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines. Sorry for the 
rambling question, but in valuating the asset, the question of
transportation 
inevitably comes up. 

Thanks
David

Attached is an Excel spreadsheet comparing fuel used between Red Rock and propose Sun Devil projects.  The Phoenix delivery of 500 MMcf/d is locked and the Cal. border deliveries decrease in 10% increments down to 60%.  If you look at the mainline fuel use only, there is a decrease in fuel used per flowing volume.  If you have any questions, please call.

I think these are the numbers you are looking for.  If not, please let me know.  

The 2002 Plan numbers include only the first three hedges as the last hedge was not done when we completed the Plan.
We are at risk for $8Mil for the hedges done in 2002.

Kevin needs to know how much money TW made in 2001 on excess fuel sales (whatever is the most current number - 3rd CE?).  And then he would also like to know revenue in the 2002 Plan dependent on excess fuel sales - let's use the Plan numbers as submitted in Nov.  (FYI Kevin, we are re-looking at the 2002 Plan right now & there could be changes.)

Kevin,

I talked with Larry Black with Southwest Gas Corp. today.  I had called him to inquire about the possibility to getting more market in the Las Vegas area.  He said that they have for quite sometime tried to come up with a way to expand their system to add new customs but could never justify it.  Larry said he would welcome the opportunity to explore a way to expand their system into Las Vegas.  Do you think that there is a way we could compete with Kern River in Las Vega or find a way to take advantage of the capacity Kern River has available from Las Vegas into Kern Mojave Pipeline?  

Larry said that he met with you and Lorraine Lindberg about 10 days ago to talk about the Sun Devil Project and he thinks that Steve Harris and Lorraine will be meeting in Las Vegas with SWG in the near future.  If we or they come up with any ideas, maybe it could be discussed then.

Steve

Ron,

Thanks for the note.  Several comments/questions-

It is not necessary to plan facilities for 750 MMcf/d and 1000 MMcf/d to meet the 16-hour day load.  At the moment, we can only identify 540 MMcf/d potential demand for 16-hour day load.   
Can we avoid a fully looped line and still serve the 540 MMcf/d demand for 16-hour day load?  
If so, would there be additional capacity that we could sell to other markets based on 24-hour loads in the Phoenix area?

I'll be out of town on Tues + Wed, returning on Thurs.  Let's get together and agree the base case for project scope.  I'll ask Susan Wadle to co-ordinate a meeting with you, Kevin, Ben, and myself.

Eric

No.  Because of the problems that occurred with the swing loads, we had to go back to the fully looped line.  Running steady state wasn't a problem but trying to meet peaks was with the 174.6 miles.  Since Planning has been guessing at what the customer wants in the way of swing capability, TW needs to nail that part down so Planning can run a GOOD analysis.  We can barely meet the 16-hour day load at 750 MMcf/d average day condition but can not at the 16-hour day at 1000 MMcf/d scenario even with fully looped pipe.  We (Planning) can run a multitude of cases that may or may not work and still may not hit the one the customer needs).  Let's get together to discuss again to make sure everyone is on the same page.  Bits and pieces from separate groups can cause problems with the true scope of work.  I would suggest you, Kevin, Ben, and myself to establish a project scope to be carried out from this day forward.  Let me know what you think about having a meeting.

Eric,

There are a multitude of cases run on this project over time and it's hard for everyone to pick the most current.  Please refer any facility questions to Planning and Optimization so we can respond with the most current information.  Arnold is right where the pipe lengths are but has the wrong story why.

The COMPLETE mainline loop from SJ tie-in to takeoff point between stations 1 and 2 was always about 222 miles.  Then add 16.5 miles downstream of station 1 for pressure support and the total is 238.61.   Some of the previous cases you have  seen did not include FULL looping, starting the Phoenix lateral at Station 2 and relied on more compression.

The Red Hawk lateral new length is based on starting at the end of the Panda Lateral to Red Hawk paralleling and existing line.

Why has the mainline estimate gone from 174.61 miles to 238.6 miles?

Not sure why they just sent it to me.  At any rate, here is the estimate consistent with the scope in the Power Point presentation being prepared for Stan.  

I would say let me know what else I can do, but I'm getting ready for a command performance this afternoon with Horton and head off to spring break vacation with my wife and high school freshman tomorrow.  

I'll be back Monday week.  Actually, Arnold or Mike Smith should be able to answer any questions you may have. 

(oops, I just noticed that the Red Hawk line is about 10 miles shorter here.  Not sure what that is about.

Energy Insight News for Wednesday, November 28, 2001
The race is on for new coal-fired generation

The race is on! Power plant developers have responded aggressively to the
power crisis in the West and the potential for power shortages in the
Midwest and Northeast, according to a report, New Coal-Fired Generation: The
Race Is On, by Boulder, Colo.-based RDI Consulting.

Using data compiled by RDI, a data division of Platts, the report estimates
the U.S. will require 296,000 MW of capacity additions by 2015 to meet
growing demand and to replace older units likely to retire. This compares
with roughly 780,000 MW of installed capacity in the U.S. today. 

RDI also projects that almost 60% of the required capacity will be built by
the end of 2006 and, despite extreme volatility in natural gas prices, the
majority of this new capacity will be gas-fired-equaling nearly 170,000 MW.
Because of that fact, for developers looking to build coal-fired plants, the
race has turned into a marathon. 

The advantage of proposed coal-fired generation is the potential for low
dispatch costs. Hypothetical plants modeled by RDI in all areas of the
country show new coal-fired generation can dispatch well ahead of gas-fired
plants and somewhat ahead of most existing coal-fired plants. 

Disadvantages of new coal-fired generation are higher initial capital costs
and greater risk, which means that new coal-fired plants are susceptible to
depressed market prices that could result from overbuilding new capacity.
Developers will have two choices in the near term if coal plants are to
succeed: wait out the surge of capacity development and be prepared to enter
the market later in the decade when the excess capacity is absorbed; or
secure long term power sales agreements and capacity contracts that will
provide enough revenue to cover the high development costs of a new coal
plant. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

Executive News
OPEC's Khelil requests meeting with Russia's Putin
OPEC President Chakib Khelil said Tuesday he had requested a meeting with
Russian President Vladimir Putin. "We have asked as the OPEC presidency for
a meeting with the Russian President, Mr Putin, we have not yet had a
response," Khelil told reporters in Algiers. OPEC is currently lobbying
Russia to make a more significant contribution to a planned OPEC/non-OPEC
round of output cuts than the 50,000 barrels per day pledged by Moscow late
last week. OPEC agreed at its Nov. 14 meeting to reduce crude output by 1.5
million barrels per day, but only if non-OPEC producers contribute a further
500,000 barrels per day reduction. Mexico has said it is willing to cut by
100,000 barrels per day, while Norway said last week it would cut by
100,000-200,000 barrels per day, as long as other producers honor their cut
pledges.

Nordic to build power plant, ethanol facility in Ohio
Nordic Energy plans to develop the first new coal-fired baseload project in
Ohio in more than a decade, an 850-MW merchant plant in the northeast part
of the state, the company said Tuesday. The coal plant, which would utilize
integrated gasification combined cycle technology, would be a cogeneration
facility that also would produce steam to run an ethanol production plant
that affiliated Nordic Biofuels intends to build nearby. Nordic Energy will
initiate an anticipated 18-month permitting process for the coal plant early
next year. Commercial operation is expected in June 2006. The coal plant is
expected to cost about $1 billion, and the ethanol facility about $150
million. "We decided this is the time to build our own plant and move
forward," said Joni Fixel, Nordic Energy director of power supply.

Kevin:  You wound me.  I was the person that called you by error, I was trying to call Michelle and dialed your number by mistake.  

So by the time I was saying who I was you had already hung up, ouch!  Sorry for the boo boo.

Hey how's is everything going?  Sometimes I hate bid week, it's too busy I don't have enough time to check in with people.  Did Michelle tell you we picked up some more transport from her on TW and may no longer be looking for more.  How's the Sun Devil project going anyway?  I haven't heard any word lately.

Hope all is well with you, take care,

FYI - I talked with David Johnson regarding that article from the New
England Power Plant Journal. He said he could not find it and he thinks he
already threw it away.  I will let you know if he locates any other
interesting articles and this time, I won't let him throw it away!

Also, I spoke with David Sweet, Independent Petroleum Association of
America.  He is interested in chairing that session, but is awaiting budget
concerns.  I'll forward the email to you that he sent me.  

We are going to call him at 9:00 a.m tomorrow.  Do you want to be included
on the call?

FERC has announced a technical conference for discusssion of allocation issues on El Paso's system for April 16, 2002.
Click below for the notice:

http://cips.ferc.gov/Q/CIPS/GAS/RP/RP00-336.002.TXT

At the public meeting on March 13, staff made a presentation, recommending that El Paso convert Full Requirements shippers to Contract Demand; provide capacity rights of the greater of billing determinant or coincidental peak; maintain the existing rate structure; maintain the 1996 settlement; and accept El Paso's proposed 20 pooling areas up from the existing 3 areas. Staff concluded that El Paso's firm service is unreliable and recommended the Commission set a technical conference. 


Staff's presentation is attached:

In preparation to present offers to APS, Duke, and Panda, the following tasks need to be completed-

James, Teb, Blair to calculate rates for $911 MM facilities according to the following guidelines-

- Rate matrix based on contract terms of 15/20/25/30 years

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

Importance:	High

Robert,
	as we discussed yesterday, the Sun Devil project is a 400 mile, $911 million pipeline expansion on the Transwestern system.  We plan to loop the existing San Juan lateral and mainline systems, plus build a new lateral from Flagstaff to Phoenix, AZ.  The project also includes several compressor additions.

We are negotiating with several large gas-fired electric generators in the Phoenix area to take capacity on the new project.  One of our current challenges is how to finance the project with the lowest cost of capital; one structure we are considering is a prepay.  Ideally, the customer would prepay for a portion of his transport up front, once the project goes in service.  All the prepaid contracts together would cover a majority of the initial construction cost ($911mm).

The question to you is:
	1) if the customer prepays the transport contract, does TW have to pay the tax on the funds when they're received?
	2) is there a way to structure around paying the tax in year one, maybe using some deferred tax liability basis?


If TW has to pay a tax on the funds, and we collect from the customer a gross-up for tax purposes, then my feeling is the pre-pay structure will be too expensive.  Please let me know your thoughts at your earliest convenience.

thanks
Kevin Hyatt

Hi there,. It has been to long since we were in touch and you have been on my mind with all the bad news from Enron.  How does this affect you and I guess I'm just wondering how you are doing.  Write when you can and let me know what is happening.

Things are fine here just getting settled in and beginning a new life in Nebraska.  It really isn't too bad and in fact it is nice living close to my parents.  They are a big help with the girls and I can do things for them that they are   unable     or too tired to do anymore.
We are living at 97th and Fort who would have thought that I would buy a house in this neighborhood and be sending my daughters to the elementary school I attended!  This is fine for now and hopefully we will get out of debt someday (after the fall of the golf shop)
and feel like we have more choices.  The Lord works in mysterious ways and remember that through all of this, things will be okay.

We will be here for Christmas so if you guys are in town be sure to call (402)571-3687.  Here is our address 9726 Ogden , Omaha, 
68134.

 Susan

Kevin:

Sorry it has taken so long to get back to you on this.  I have been knee deep on the TW/NNG pipeline financings for the past 4 weeks.  I have sent a note to ENE's Bank relationship officer to get the names of the Citi and SocGen folks who would have worked on this. When I get the names, I will do some digging for you and Eric.

Kevin--
	As we discussed yesterday, Panda Energy International, Inc. and TECO Energy, Inc. (Tampa Electric) have formed a partnership to build, own, and operate a 2300 Mw gas-fired electric generation plant located in Maricopa County, Arizona, southwest of Phoenix.  The partnership may be called "Panda Gila River L.P."

Here are some of the details as we know them:
	All building/ air permits received, construction has commenced
	Financing closed 6/04/01 (oversubscribed by 56%)
	$2.2 bn loan ($1.7bn 5 yr. bullet loan and $500mm equity bridge)
	Financing led by Citibank and Societe Generale
	50% of power output sold under long term contracts, 50% on spot market

What we want to know is:
	How did the banks get comfortable on the financing if only 25% of the gas pipeline transport capacity is under contract? (And right now there is only one pipeline capable of serving the plant's needs)
How did the banks get comfortable with only 50% of the power output sold under long term contracts?

What happens after the bullet loan comes due-- are the operators taking interest rate risk and hoping to refinance at a lower rate in year 5?

Any information you can provide on the above would be very helpful.  We are scheduled to meet with Panda in Dallas on Tuesday 11/6.
thanks for the help.

if heat exhaust is counted in the "renewable" category, this would be another opportunity to take waste heat at TW compressor stations and convert it to electricity at above market rates.  We are looking at one of these opportunties at TW station 1.

Kevin,

FYI--The New Mexico PRC has issued a proposed Renewable Energy Rule which would require providers of electricity to increase the percentage of their portfolio of energy supply from renewable sources.  Please review and let me know if this is something you feel we need to comment on.  My opinion would be that even if it impacted our business, it would be hard to argue against renewable sources of energy.  Below is the link to the proposed rule.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Mr. Jess K. Hyatt

Dear Mr. Hyatt:

In the wake of recent events, I want to confirm that CERA is proceeding

* Strategic Tracks - Finance, Environment, Technology and Markets -
Offering an integrated agenda across the week, underscoring the key
linkages and common themes across energy segments and regions.

* Enhanced CERAWeek Online - Expanded multimedia coverage offering
highlights and interviews, conference panels, live simulcasts, and

participants to gain lasting value; and to share the learning and
sessions across your organization. This enhanced coverage will be

information on this new feature can be found on our website at:
http://www.cera.com/ceraweek2002/cw02_premium.pdf .

CERAWeek 2002 is our most tangible expression of commitment to the

The notice announcing the public conference on El Paso's Full Requirements
capacity allocation was issued and is attached.  The conference will be
held on April 16 at 10:00 a.m.

The notice contains a reference to the Staff's proposal and a description
of such.  The only "discussion paper" available is the power point
presentation made at the March 13th open Commission meeting, which I am
also attaching.  To note, during the discussion at that meeting it was
indicated that this may be a Commissioner-level conference.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

I have had confirmation from the firms in New Mexico and in Arizona relating to my original research memo furnished you on Sept 24.

The memo stands basically unchanged.  Both firms agreed the conclusions were valid for both states.

The Arizona 65% deduction is made from the gross receipts as follows:

Proceeds/Cost/Revenue
Less cost of pipe/valves/compressor/etc
subtotal
Less 65%
Equals tax base
Times Tax Rate
Equals Tax

There is additional information on Tribal laws from the New Mexico firm.  I am attaching my original memo plus the memo received this hour from the Albuquerque firm:

 		 

If I have left anyone off of the distribution list, please forward to them.

The Pitch: 

On Saturday and Sunday, April 20 - 21, 2002, I will be joining over 9,000 other cyclists riding 180 miles from Houston to Austin in the annual BP MS 150 Bike Tour. The tour is a charity fundraising event supporting the National MS Society's fight against multiple sclerosis. 
I am calling on you and all of my friends and family to contribute on my behalf to the National MS Society. By making a pledge, you are supporting MS research, programs and education. You are also helping me acheive my fundraising goal of $300.00! 
Instead of going to the trouble of mailing a check, you can use the following link to donate online in my name. You can hyperlink on the link below to go to the BP MS 150 site, where donating is fast, easy and secure. At the website you will be able to choose an amount to donate and make the donation immediately. I will be notified via email as soon as you make your pledge. 
http://www.ms150.org/ms150/donate/ 
Be sure to fill in my name and email address so I will get credit. If you would like more information about the tour and about MS, the site has a wealth of information. 
Thanks! 
Sincerely, 
Rick Krejci

 All,

> I was told a story recently about a person who had his briefcase stolen
> while on a business trip.  He lost everything.  Inside the briefcase was
> his passport, wallet, house keys, car keys and cash.  I guess no one told
> him NOT to keep everything in one place!  He immediately went back to his
> hotel room and dialed the numbers listed below. The only thing the thieves
> got was a free tank of gas.  They literally filled their tank within 2
> blocks of the hotel.  But that is all they got.  After calling the numbers
> below, the next call was to the local police department.  A call was then
> made to  his hometown Department of Motor Vehicles and Social Security
> office.  He  then called his wife requesting she get all the locks changed
> on the house and cars immediately.  This is excellent advice.  Another
> good piece of advise is to place the contents of your wallet on a
> photocopy machine, do both sides of each license, credit card, etc.  You
> will know what you had in your wallet along with the account numbers and
> the phone numbers to call in case you need to cancel.  Keep the copy in a

> We have all heard horror stories about fraud that is committed using

> diligent.  It is also the first step toward an investigation.  But here's
> what is perhaps most important (I never thought of doing this) - Call the
> three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place a FRAUD
> ALERT on your name and social security number.  The alert means any
> company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen. They
> have to contact you by phone, at a number you provide, to authorize any

> 
> The numbers are:  Equifax : 1-800-525-6285, Experian (formerly TRW) :

Title: Hidden Risks: Microbasis in the Short-term Gas Markets 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2826;


***********************************************************************

STRUCTURAL RISK AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY GROW IN INFLUENCE IN REGIONAL GAS 
MARKETS. 

The dramatic increase of participants in the daily market for natural gas over 
the past several years has brought with it the demand for pricing indices that 
are increasingly regional and selective in nature. These published indices 
provide a valuable service to the market, but the high level of confidence that 
the general trading community has bestowed upon them may be misplaced.

*  Current economic conditions are masking hidden volatility potential, 
especially at local index points that have unrealized demand potential.

*  Large, volatile demand in the form of new gas-fired generation utilizes the 
existing pipeline system in ways that were never envisioned in the original 
system design.
 
*  Control of pipeline infrastructure has moved from the relatively benign 
local distribution companies to economically driven traders and asset managers.
 
*  As demand grows, physical flexibility in the system and the number of buyers 
and sellers decrease on the margin.

Kevin,

We need to start actively pinging other shippers (Duke, SW Gas, Salt River Project, Sempra) to lock down Sun Devil transport agreements.  Also, we should organize a communication plan for the San Juan producers + plant operators and organize a roll-out.  Let's form a strategy and then recruit Kim W and company to help promote.

Kevin,

With respect to James' latest economic analysis, ($843 MM capx; 550,000/d firm contracts to Phoenix; 60/40 debt/equity, 4.75% fuel in years 1/2/3, tracker thereafter) for each year of the project, I'd like to see-

Fianancial statements for each year
- Income statement
- Balance sheet
- Funds flow

Financial ratios for each year during the 20 year contract term
- Debt to capitalization
- Debt Equity
- Debt to Asset
- Times Interest Earned
- Debt Service Coverage

Amount of unrecovered debt and equity at the end of the 20 year contracts, 

Distributable cash for each year - - - depending how much there is, we could lock it up to pay off debt
