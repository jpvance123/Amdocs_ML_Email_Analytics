Vince:

Thanks for your time earlier this week; I'm looking forward to your eSpeak 
event.

Sarah and I met with our eTV contact yesterday, and we will be able to put a 
bulleted list on the elevator screens to advertise your eSpeak.  Please let 
me know what you would like us to post for you, and we will do the rest!

We also have plans to market specifically to the trader community here at 
Enron, so you should get a high participation rate, especially from those 
groups.

Thanks, again.

Dear Mr. Gardner,

It is very kind you to spare your very busy time to
help me try to publish a Japanese version of RISK book
"Managing Energy Price Risk, 2nd Edition."

I would like to report you that a Japanese financial
publication company "KINZAI" last week agreed to try to
make direct contact with you about the specification of
Japanese edition of the book. So they will offer more
precise condition than my last email below.  Please
take trouble to let me know if any unclear point exist
on the process.

Thanks again for your kindness.

Best regards,

Hi Vince,
?
Hope you are fine. I hope that Grant's  leaving?hasn't affected your group 
too much?
?
EPRM's Paul Bristow has been in touch about a VaR  training course involving 
Les, yourself and I. Are you interested? We would  be?extremely happy to work 
with you. He was talking about London and  Houston which I don't know if it 
fits with your travel schedule. Maybe we can  sort something out.
?
I hope to have the next article with you by early  next week.
?
Best regards as always, and many thanks for your  book promotional efforts!
?
Chris.

Hi Vince,

In order to provide the marketing department with sufficient lead time for
our financial mathematics course, the brochure will need to be printed by
the end of next week. I would like to confirm the bullets for your two
sessions at the 2001 series of courses. If you feel that there is little
need to update the points I'll include the previous outlines. The one
addition I would like to make is on the 'practical example' point at the end
of each session. If we could provide a line outlining what the example would
be, this would add some important information to this event.

I will be in the office until Wedesday afternoon and would very much like to
talk with you about your views on this years' event. I will be out of the
office on Thursday and Friday and will need to confirm my changes at the
start of next week.

I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Best wishes,

Paul Bristow

Hi Paul,

I've just done a send/receive messages from home  and ours passed during this

Hi  Chris,
?
Following a meeting today to discuss the forward  plan, the decision has been 
made to shelve the VAR course in it's current  format. An?re-run of the 
previous event has been agreed. There have been  a number of events that were 
to be re-researched and radically altered, but  with the number of new events 
on the schedule, producer time and budgets have  been taken up by the larger 
conferences. 
?
I  would like to apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused. I will 
be  responsible for a number of events on credit risk management, real 
options  theory, exotic options and weather risk management in the second 
half of the  year and will send a calendar to give more notice for these 
events. Victoria  Kerridge will be producing our largest annual energy event 
in Europe and I  have forwarded your details for a possible presentation and 
post-conference  seminar opportunity. If you have any questions please drop 
me a  line.
?
Best  wishes,

Just  an extra note regarding the course. If the reimbursements are suitable 
I would  like to finalise the line-up ASAP (Vince and a European Enron 
representative).  If you were unable to participate I would need to offer 
alternative  invitations by the end of this week.

Hi  Chris,
?
I've  been looking at the forward plan and the total budget for speaker 
expenses is  5500 pounds (US keyboard, no pound sign). At current exchange 
rates this comes  to a little over 15,000 Australian dollars. I would be 
happy to cover your  expenses up to this figure.
?
The  course is scheduled to run in Amsterdam (not London as originally 
planned) and  Houston. The dates are slightly flexible?to?work with your 
travel  schedules. For instance, would you prefer to travel to  
Sydney-Houston-Amsterdam-Sydney, or in the opposite  direction?
?
If  you could contact me to?let me know if this would?enable you to  commit 
to the course, I would be delighted to forward the notes from the  research. 
I would plan to then work on the outline until March  1st.I look forward to 
speaking with you  soon.

Hi Chris,

I would like to confirm the dates of some of the  forthcoming EPRM events:
?
Effective VaR and stress testing  techniques for the US energy industry. This 
event will run on the  21 & 22 May in London and the 28 & 29 May in Houston. 
Michele Du  Berry (Director of Conferences) and I are looking at how we have  
structured the training courses and are keen to present a different  outline 
than on previous courses. I would like to run this event with 2-3  trainers 
per venue, rather than with 7-8 as we have done in the past. If  you and Les 
Clewlow would be interested in leading this course (possible  with Vince 
Kaminski) I would be delighted to discuss the event in greater  detail.
?
Energy & Power Risk Management,  Europe. Our largest annual European event is 
scheduled to between  September 19-21. Victoria Kerridge will be producing 
this event from the  London office and will be starting research in two 
weeks. I am going to be  providing her with a brief and will ensure that she 
has your contact  details.
?
I have also been finalizing the details for the  annual Energy & Power Risk 
Management event in Houston. This will take  place on May 14th & 15th and is 
close to completion. I would be happy  to provide you with more details, 
without potentially running the risk of  overloading your schedule with a 
number of events in a short space of time  (VaR and EPRM, Houston). My 
priority is to secure trainers for our VaR  course.
?
If you would be interested in any of the events  listed, I would be happy to 
talk with you this week. My direct line is 212  925 6990, extension 225. 
?
Best wishes,

Hi Paul,
?
Just a note so that you have my address. Do  you have dates for the US and 
European conferences yet? I'm sure that we  can arrange other work at the 
same time to offset the expenses of  speaking at these events if you want us 
to participate.
?
You also mentioned a training course on VaR  and the energy area. We had an 
EPRM article last year with Vince on a  comparison of the different 
techniques on a trial portfolio that might  form the basis of something 
useful. Anyway, let me know.

Hi Vince

It is my great pleasure to invite you to speak at POWER 2000 which will be
in Houston on 9 & 10 May 2000.

Would you be interested in chairing one of the streams on day 2 of the
conference? Or making a full presentation on one of the days? Please let me
know which talks interest you. Obviously, some of the talks are no longer
available but I would like to give you a choice as much as possible. Please
could you get back to me asap on 212 925 1864 Ext 151 or by return email.

I very much hope you can make the dates as I'm very keen to have you
participate at POWER. Not to flatter you unnecessarily, but I know that a
lot of people come to our conferences to hear what you have to say.

Best regards

Emma

 It appears that things are filling up fast.  Among the open topics listed, 
"Techniques for the clarification and quantification of operational risk 
within the energy industry" and "VaR, stress testing, and extreme value 
theory within an enterprise risk management framework" seem to be the best.

 We have liberty to suggest our own topic, maybe along the lines of 
asset/liability management.  Do you have a preference?

Dear Kevin,
?
Following our telephone conversation, please  find attached a summary of 
topics proposed for inclusion in the forthcoming  Enterprise Risk Management 
conference. Last year the event attracted over eighty  delegates and more are 
expected this year. The conference will be held in  Houston on Thursday 16th 
and Friday 17th November, with a pre-conference seminar  on the 15th. As we 
discussed, I would be delighted to invite Enron to lead a  session. I would 
be happy to consider any of the available sessions or if you  have a session 
that you feel is currently missing from the programme, do not  hesitate to 
make a suggestion.
?
I have attached a file that gives an indication  of the topics that have been 
identified so far. Although I have bullet points  for the sessions I would 
first like to identify interested parties and then work  with them to develop 
a session that reflects their particular expertise and  experience. I also 
think that by continuously developing the points we can make  greater 
allowances for continuity between each participant.
?
I look forward to speaking with you  soon.
?
Yours sincerely,
?

Dear Vince,
?
Thanks for your call the other day regarding  EPRM's upcoming enterprise risk 
management conference. We seem to be making  progress and are pulling 
together some interesting subjects for inclusion this  year. I am currently 
at a stage where there are plenty of possible sessions and  over the next 
week I will be able to decide of which will stay and which will  go. 
?
I have attached a file that gives an indication  of the topics that have been

?
Based on our discussion I would be extremely  interested in inviting you to 
lead a session on the main conference. You seemed  to have an interesting 
view on operational risk and the particular challenges  that are presented 
within the energy industry. This session will run on  Thursday, November 
16th. The title is reasonably broad at this stage and any  suggestions are 
welcome.
?
Your overall views on the current conference content is also  welcome and if 
you feel that another session is more suited to your work do not  hesitate to 
contact me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
?
Yours sincerely,
?

Hi Vince


Just wanted to thank you for your participation at POWER 2000  last week and 
for contributing to the success of the conference. The feedback we  received 
was absolutely glowing and we were delighted with the smooth-running of  the 
event. Thank you for being a key part of that. As always, your presentations  
went down extremely well and your presence at our events makes a big 
difference,  as people are alwyas keen to hear both form you personally and 
from ENRON as a  company.

As I mentioned to you, I have recently been given the  responsibility of 
creating and developing a new conference stream in the  financial technology 
sector under the Waters brand, so I would like to take this  opportunity to 
say how much I have enjoyed working with you in the past couple  of years and 
to wish you the best of luck in the future. Please stay in touch  and if you 
come to New York, please let me know so I can take you out for a  drink!

Best regards and thank you again both for your patience in  helping me 
research topics and for being so willing to participate at our  events.
Emma

As a speaker at EPRM's highly successful Power 2000 event in  Houston, I am 
writing to inform you of our 2001 annual congress and to introduce  myself. I 
will be responsible for the production of all North American EPRM  events 
having moved from our banking conference and training course division in  
July. Just to update you on the whereabouts of the EPRM team, Emma Wolfin is  
developing our technology events for Waters conferences and Joel Hanley will 
be  starting his new role as an EPRM journalist from November 1st.

EPRM 2001 will be held in Houston on the 14th, 15th & 16th  of May and I am 
keen to start the initial research as soon as possible. I intend  to call 
each Power 2000 speaker within the next two weeks. Initially, I would  like 
to provide you with advanced notice of the event and wish to clarify some  
issues.

What current industry developments merit streams or pre/post conference  
seminars at EPRM 2001?

What research are you or your company involved in that would justify  
inclusion in EPRM 2001?

Aside from your own work, what subjects are currently at the  cutting-edge of 
energy risk management?

Who else would you recommend as a potential speaker? (Regulatory bodies,  
academics, practitioners)

Any assistance at this initial stage of research is  appreciated. You can 
email me or call on +44 20 7484 9883. I look forward to  working with you on 
this event.

Hi Paul,
?
Thanks for the e-mail. Sorry I missed your calls  this morning but I was at 
the dentist, where its difficult to speak at the best  of times!
?
I'm sorry but it doesn't look like we will be able  to commit to?the EPRM VaR 
conference. We are still a small company and the  trip would tie us up for 
over a week. I'm sure you'll understand that internally  we just can't 
justify?the two senior members of the company?to be away  on EPRM business 
and to have to pay money from our own pocket?to run this  course for you. It 
was a difficult decision originally to?offer our  services at expenses only 
with no fee, but we did so for the potential  opportunity to work some more 
with Vince.
?
Good luck in your search for alternative course  leaders.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.

Hi  Chris,
?
Just  an extra note regarding the course. If the reimbursements are suitable 
I would  like to finalise the line-up ASAP (Vince and a European Enron 
representative).  If you were unable to participate I would need to offer 
alternative  invitations by the end of this week.
?
All  the best,

Hi  Chris,
?
I've  been looking at the forward plan and the total budget for speaker 
expenses is  5500 pounds (US keyboard, no pound sign). At current exchange 
rates this comes  to a little over 15,000 Australian dollars. I would be 
happy to cover your  expenses up to this figure.
?
The  course is scheduled to run in Amsterdam (not London as originally 
planned) and  Houston. The dates are slightly flexible?to?work with your 
travel  schedules. For instance, would you prefer to travel to  
Sydney-Houston-Amsterdam-Sydney, or in the opposite  direction?
?
If  you could contact me to?let me know if this would?enable you to  commit 
to the course, I would be delighted to forward the notes from the  research. 
I would plan to then work on the outline until March  1st.I look forward to 
speaking with you  soon.
?
Best  wishes,
?
Paul  Bristow?

Hi Chris,
?
I would like to confirm the dates of some of the  forthcoming EPRM events:
?
Effective VaR and stress testing  techniques for the US energy industry. This 
event will run on the  21 & 22 May in London and the 28 & 29 May in Houston. 
Michele Du  Berry (Director of Conferences) and I are looking at how we have  
structured the training courses and are keen to present a different  outline 
than on previous courses. I would like to run this event with 2-3  trainers 
per venue, rather than with 7-8 as we have done in the past. If  you and Les 
Clewlow would be interested in leading this course (possible  with Vince 
Kaminski) I would be delighted to discuss the event in greater  detail.
?
Energy & Power Risk Management,  Europe. Our largest annual European event is 
scheduled to between  September 19-21. Victoria Kerridge will be producing 
this event from the  London office and will be starting research in two 
weeks. I am going to be  providing her with a brief and will ensure that she 
has your contact  details.
?
I have also been finalizing the details for the  annual Energy & Power Risk 
Management event in Houston. This will take  place on May 14th & 15th and is 
close to completion. I would be happy  to provide you with more details, 
without potentially running the risk of  overloading your schedule with a 
number of events in a short space of time  (VaR and EPRM, Houston). My 
priority is to secure trainers for our VaR  course.
?
If you would be interested in any of the events  listed, I would be happy to 
talk with you this week. My direct line is 212  925 6990, extension 225. 
?
Best wishes,
?

Hi Paul,
?
Just a note so that you have my address. Do  you have dates for the US and 
European conferences yet? I'm sure that we  can arrange other work at the 
same time to offset the expenses of  speaking at these events if you want us 
to participate.
?
You also mentioned a training course on VaR  and the energy area. We had an 
EPRM article last year with Vince on a  comparison of the different 
techniques on a trial portfolio that might  form the basis of something 
useful. Anyway, let me know.

Best regards.

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my 
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and 
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the 
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the 
credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear all,

Thanks for your responses regarding availability and thoughts for the 2001
financial maths course. Attached is a word version of the previous outline.
I have also included some comments from previous delegates on what they
would like to see this year. Most points address the level we should aim for
and the balance of theory and practical applications. I hope these points
help you to improve on what is already our premier EPRM training course.

I would like to confirm the final points and any new biographical details by
Thursday, March 22nd in order to allow us a strong lead time to market the
event. If you have any questions, please call me on 212 925 6990 extension
225 or send me an email.

As a checklist these are the points I would like to clarify:

1. Confirmed availability for venues outlined in the draft programme.
 London, 28 & 29 June
 New York, 9 & 10 July
 Houston, 16 & 17 July

Unless specified on the draft, each speaker is down for each of the three
venues. Please let me know if this is not possible.

2. Updated talk titles and bullet points. These should be updated to reflect
the developments in the energy markets since September 2000.
3. Full name and job titles as you wish them to appear on the brochure.
4. Updated biographies. I will assume that the biographies from previous
courses are correct unless told otherwise.
5.  Mailing addresses for the speaker packs.

Overall, the response to the 2000 events was extremely positive with a very
high satisfaction rate. Key points from delegate feedback were as follows:

1. The challenge for this course is to maintain the right balance between
theory and practice. Delegates have requested the most advanced research and
mathematical theory for inclusion. The flip-side of the coin is that they
also would like as many practical examples as possible. On the attached
draft, where PRACTICAL EXAMPLE(S) are included as the final bullet point I
would like to include a one line description of the practical example you
will provide for the audience.

2. Delegates have requested more time spent on actual modelling rather than
examinations of quantitative discussions of the energy markets in general.
Again, I think that we provide a good balance between the two.

3. Basically, the audience who attend this are eager to attend the most
advanced financial mathematics course available for energy practitioners. I
think that with the current market developments this approach combined with
the impact of recent events we will have an extremely topical and exciting
event this July.


I look forward to seeing your responses next week. Please contact me to
discuss the existing arrangements for travel and accommodation
reimbursement.

Best wishes,

Paul Bristow

Dear all,

Firstly, I would like to thank you for all your help on the Energy & Power
Risk Management 2001 event. The line-up is exceptional and I am extremely
excited about this event.

As the course leaders of our annual financial mathematics training course, I
would like to notify you of the dates for the event this year. We plan to
hold the courses at the following venues on the following dates:

HOUSTON - June 21 & 22

I would like to confirm availability for these events and to take on board
any update suggestions for the 2001 course. I do hope that these dates
enable you to participate in this event and I look forward to speaking with
each of you soon.

Best wishes,

Paul Bristow

Yes, That's fine.  If you can please give me her full contact details
including e-mail and address I will have her registered as a co-speaker.

If you would like to bring your own copies to the event I would ask you to
send 200 copies directly to the venue.  Although if you can get it to me on
Friday I can still insert it!

Could I please trouble you for a short biography?

Kind Regards

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her
the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Vince

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates
rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards

Great Job Vince.  I know people will be knocking themselves over for the 
book.  I know for a fact that the consultants can make a lot of money just 
'reselling' stuff that are in the book!  I know first hand since D&T did that 
with even the first version.

I think the FAS 133 article by some out-of-work nuclear engineer was the bomb!

Ravi.

Conrad,

Thanks for your message.

There are 3 papers Enron contributed to the last MEPR.

There is also another paper on electricity I contributed to the "red book" on 
US
power markets, as well as a paper or credit risk management, and a paper
on weather derivatives. All these papers included in other RISK books were 
written by Enron 
employees.

We would like them included as well, if technically possible.


I think that offering other energy related books through our site, in 
addition to MEPR2,
is fine, but I would leave the decision to Dan Diamond, who is responsible 
for the project.


Vince

Just a quick note to say that I have now left the EPRM/Risk conference
division after two and a half very happy years. I am however still at Risk
Waters Group, where I am now working as a journalist on EPRM magazine.
Future conference enquiries should go to Paul Bristow (US - 212 925 6990) or
Frances Tully (Europe - +44 (0) 20 7484 9731).

Many thanks for your work my events and I hope we can work together again in
the future. If you have any ideas on the writing side then I would always
appreciate a call or email - my contact details all remain the same.

Best regards,

Dear all,

Thanks for your responses regarding availability and thoughts for the 2001
financial maths course. Attached is a word version of the previous outline.
I have also included some comments from previous delegates on what they
would like to see this year. Most points address the level we should aim for
and the balance of theory and practical applications. I hope these points
help you to improve on what is already our premier EPRM training course.

I would like to confirm the final points and any new biographical details by
Thursday, March 22nd in order to allow us a strong lead time to market the
event. If you have any questions, please call me on 212 925 6990 extension
225 or send me an email.

As a checklist these are the points I would like to clarify:

1. Confirmed availability for venues outlined in the draft programme.
 London, 28 & 29 June
 New York, 9 & 10 July
 Houston, 16 & 17 July

Unless specified on the draft, each speaker is down for each of the three
venues. Please let me know if this is not possible.

2. Updated talk titles and bullet points. These should be updated to reflect
the developments in the energy markets since September 2000.
3. Full name and job titles as you wish them to appear on the brochure.
4. Updated biographies. I will assume that the biographies from previous
courses are correct unless told otherwise.
5.  Mailing addresses for the speaker packs.

Overall, the response to the 2000 events was extremely positive with a very
high satisfaction rate. Key points from delegate feedback were as follows:

1. The challenge for this course is to maintain the right balance between
theory and practice. Delegates have requested the most advanced research and
mathematical theory for inclusion. The flip-side of the coin is that they
also would like as many practical examples as possible. On the attached
draft, where PRACTICAL EXAMPLE(S) are included as the final bullet point I
would like to include a one line description of the practical example you
will provide for the audience.

2. Delegates have requested more time spent on actual modelling rather than
examinations of quantitative discussions of the energy markets in general.
Again, I think that we provide a good balance between the two.

3. Basically, the audience who attend this are eager to attend the most
advanced financial mathematics course available for energy practitioners. I
think that with the current market developments this approach combined with
the impact of recent events we will have an extremely topical and exciting
event this July.


I look forward to seeing your responses next week. Please contact me to
discuss the existing arrangements for travel and accommodation
reimbursement.

Best wishes,

Paul Bristow

Dear Vince

I am delighted that you have agreed to take part in the Energy and Power
Risk Management 4th annual congress ? POWER 2000 ? which will be taking
place on 9 & 10 May 2000 in Houston, TX at the Houstonian.

As you know Energy and Power Risk Management Magazine has an excellent
reputation in the energy community and we want to make this event as
successful as possible.  We are currently in the process of launching the
event and researching the publications and associations mentioned during the
research for the conference to make sure that we are getting the best
coverage.   Before we complete the marketing plan for the conference we want
to be sure that we are reaching all the people who may be interested.

We constantly strive to improve the marketing of our events and therefore we
ask our speakers for further ideas and contacts. Therefore please could you
let me know whether you could help with any of the following.

Are there any particular people that you need to send brochures to? - we can
carry out any mailing on your behalf if you supply us with contact names and
addresses, alternatively I can send you a quantity of brochures

Do you have any in-house publications or a newsletter that we should insert
the course brochure into - or a diary date page that we could be included
on?

Would you like to write to your clients to invite them to attend? We can
offer them a 10% discount and can send them a letter or if you prefer to
write on your own letterhead we will organise the copying and distribution
for you.

Have you any delegate lists from events you have spoken at or attended with
a similar target audience to whom we should be sending information about the
course?

Do you have an internet site on which the course could be mentioned?

Do you have any other ideas? Any suggestions would be welcome.

Our marketing manager, Caroline Hyndman will contact you in the near future
to discuss any ideas you may have. Alternatively please give me a call on
212 925 1864 Ext 151.

Thanks very much for your help in this matter.

Best regards,

Emma

Hi Vince, I have a quick question for you.  The EOL folks want to put a 
couple of articles from the Risk book (Managing Energy Price Risk) on the 
internet.  I told them that  would be a copywrite violation.  Is there 
someone at Risk they could call to get permission for this, or is it even 
worth calling?  Thanks

Ross

Subject: Invitation to present at Risk's advanced stress testing course



I would like to invite you to present a section on  Risk's course entitled, 
"Practical application of advanced stress  testing" which will be held in 
London (5 & 6 February 2001)  and New York (12 & 13 February 2001).
?
You have been recommended to me in the course of my  research as an authority 
in this field so I would be delighted for you to  present any of the sections 
that are still available on the attached  programme:

For London: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 4 and  
For New York: sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4 and 8

My market research indicates that advanced stress  testing is a highly 
interesting theme for a wide range of senior quantitative  analysts and risk 
managers. I anticipate the course to be technical and  practical in nature 
and assume a high level of knowledge from the delegates. It  aims to extend 
the scope of accepted practices into the new areas of liquidity  and credit 
risk stress testing and complement VaR methods by introducing new  risk 
measurement techniques that can be applied in an integrated  context.
?
Please contact me as soon as possible with an indication of which section  is 
most suitable for your current interests. If you feel that you will not be  
able to participate on this occasion, I would welcome any speaker 
suggestions  you may have. Please call me if you have any questions.

Many thanks,

Dear Mr Kaminski,

I do hope that you had a pleasant Christmas and New Year, like ourselves at 
Risk.

I am currently producing the Author Cards which you discussed with my 
Manager, Paula Soutinho, and would like to know where you would like them 
delivered to.   I have ordered a quantity of 200 which I hope is to your 
satisfaction.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate in contacting either myself or 
Paula,

Yes, That's fine.  If you can please give me her full contact details
including e-mail and address I will have her registered as a co-speaker.

If you would like to bring your own copies to the event I would ask you to
send 200 copies directly to the venue.  Although if you can get it to me on
Friday I can still insert it!

Could I please trouble you for a short biography?

Kind Regards

Layla

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her
the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Vince

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates
rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards

Dear Navroz

Thanks for getting back to me.  The reason there has been a dialogue (not, I 
should point out, with Nick, but with Shan Millie), is that my work is of 
quite a large size, and needs to find an appropriate home.  The question is 
should it go into a compilation book, or somehow be published in the 
magazine?  I was awaiting some feedback from Risk on the best course of 
action.

We were hoping to publish a cut down version in the magazine, and a full 
version in Risk's upcoming "Game Choices" book, but I've heard nothing from 
your organisation until now (and I fear we've now missed the boat on the Game 
Choices book deadline).   I'm attaching the full internal Enron document for 
your reference, and I'd appreciate your thoughts on how best to put the 
article in your journal.  Since the subject is highly diagrammatic, I'm 
concerned that 4000 words may be too many when coupled with diagrams!  (It is 
currently only 6000 words, but is around 25 A4 pages long.)  If you can give 
me some guidance on the issue of publishing extensive diagrams as part of the 
text, I'll get to work chopping my work around until it suits your preferred 
format.

Shan Millie gave me some good feedback on general points of style and clarity 
in my writing, but incorporating these would actually make the article longer 
rather than shorter.  I think you'd better look the document over before I do 
further work on it.

I look forward to your response.

Many thanks,
Steve Leppard

Emma,

Mergers and acquisitions are not my cup of tea.

Chairing stream 1 on day 1 seems to be a better match.

Hi Vince

Thanks for getting back to me quickly! As it happens, all of the sessions
you suggested are already taken!

So, would you be interested in chairing EITHER stream 1 on day 1 of the
conference - "Pricing and Trading in the US Power Market"  OR stream 3 on
day 2 of the conference - "Latest Developments in the US Energy Industry".
For your information, the people presenting on day 1 in stream 1 include:

- Spyros Maragos, Dynegy on volatility
- Sanjeev Khanna, PG & E on correlation
- Gary Morsches, Southern on optimising information to accurately price and
trade electricity
- Blake Johnson, Stanford University on modelling power prices
- Craig Pirrong, Olin School of Business, Washington University on building
the optimal forward curve

On day 2, stream 3, there are only 3 talks in that stream, as after lunch we
will be breaking for plenary sessions and the Industry Briefing sessions
too. But the people who will be speaking in that stream are:

- Venu Nagali, Stanford University on real options
- Ram Challa, Sithe Energies (he was formerly at Bankers Trust) on
generation assets

I have the slot on Mergers and Acquisitions in stream 3 on day 2 as still
available but I'm not sure if that session is your area of speciality? Let
me know.

Thanks Vince and very much looking forward to working with you again.

Emma
