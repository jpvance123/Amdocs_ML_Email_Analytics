Chris,

Below, is the confirmed shipment dates for the change order equipment that
you currently have on order with us.

A couple of these (modular control room, 50 ft and retrofit to add Power
System Stabilizer to generator) need new line items in Exhibit N-2 when
writing up the change order.

Thanks,

Lee

Gentlemen,

Attached are GE's comments which I just received.  They are concerned that we 
tried to improve the contract.  Oh well.

I hope to get this resolved today so we can wrap it up early next week.

Talk to you soon,

Re: Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement for Austin turbines
I've added the equipment description in Schedule 1 and changed the date of 
the agreement to November 30, 2000 (see attached redlined version).
Ben/Eric - can you verify that my unit numbers in Schedule 1 match your list 
of unit numbers?
David - can you sign off on this for accounting?
Once we have sign-off from accounting, we can circulate the document once 
more with Winston & Strawn.  Hopefully it should be in pretty good shape by 
tomorrow.  Thanks,

Ben:

See the email below from Rebecca to Catherine Clark.

Rebecca informed me a few minutes ago that Catherine is planning to speak 
with Peter Anderson (ESA Corporate Finance) and make it clear to him that ESA 
is responsible for paying the Execution Amount (already determined in the 
Agreement) plus the interest cost ($21,500 per day) until the day on which 
funding occurs. 

If the transaction closes & funds tomorrow as expected, ESA's interest 
payment will be based upon 28 days.  If for some reason the funding is 
delayed, ESA will be responsible for the additional interest cost until 
funding occurs.  Catherine believes that if ESA delivers their notice to 
close [as expected] by 9:30 am tomorrow morning, then there is a high 
likelihood that closing and funding will occur tomorrow.

Rebecca and Catherine believe, and I concur, that this information is best 
delivered verbally directly to ESA's finance person (Peter Anderson).

Call me tonight at home if you wish to discuss.

Fred

Catherine

Ben is concerned that ESA may not be funded on the same day it is closed 
(tomorrow), and that ENA will end up paying the $21,500 in interest for each 
day between closing and funding.  By what time tomorrow must everything be 
executed/wired to ensure that funding and closing both take place tomorrow?

Please include Fred Mitro on future correspondance about this deal.  He is 
working with Kay Mann on both this deal and the Coral energy deal while  Ben 
is out of the office.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless
there is some reason to handle it otherwise.

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do
you
have more copies of that document that we can attach?

Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for
the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on
Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change
to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2,
this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect
scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit
liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads,
guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire
contract
document.


Regards,

Lee

I will review it tomorrow and touch base with you or Kay.  I will be at a
closing the next two days, which has tied me up for weeks, but 99% of the work
for it should be done today.  That will give me time to focus on this.  I will
call tomorrow.

Subject:  Facility Agreement--"breakout contract"

Security Level:?         Internal



Kay Mann passed along your e-mail address when I asked about how I could be
of help in moving the Facility Agreement "breakout contract" forward.

I am working on a transaction that will require that we have the ability to
move two of the ten transformers Enron North America, as agent, purchased
from ABB.  The transaction is expected to be signed prior to the end of the
year.

The counterparty to our transaction has pressed us for a copy of the
contract under which the transformers will be conveyed.  I understand that
you have been working with Kay on the form of contract.  To the extent that
I can provide any input or can otherwise move the process along, I am
anxious to do so.

Please give me a call to discuss how we can move the process forwards.  I
can be reached at (503) 464-8863.

Thanks.

Hi Ben,

I've started a draft of the ESA document, and I wanted to get your comments 
before I go much further.  Basically, I want to make sure  I'm on the right 
track.



I'll make it look pretty as we go along.  Getting the deal points are most 
important at this point.  

Thanks,

Kay

Sean, 
1.  On the signature lines for each document, please provide the role that 
each party is signing as.  Also, Wilmington Trust is signing as Manager for 
E-Next Generation LLC.

2.  Please obtain from Catherine Clark the extension and transfer documents 
on the Blue Dog turbines.  In mid-November, the transaction with LJM was 
extended and EECC assigned their option and agency role to ENA.

3.  I'll let the lawyers make their comments and direct you as to 
distribution of these documents to both WestLB/counsel and TurboPark parties.

Regards, Lisa

Lee,

Your changes to the letter look fine to me.

I'm attaching the latest version I have on change order #2.  Are we ready
to go with this one?

(See attached file: changeorder#2rev7.doc)

We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.  I believe GE prepared #4.
Could you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently
deleted from my computer. Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing
of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

Thanks,

Lee

Hi Kathy,

Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6

Definitions.  I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and 
replace of business days for Business Days.

1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of 
performance test reports.  I think we need a definition that incorporates the 
tests listed on Exhibit E.

The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of 
the installation option when I did a search.

3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?  Does it matter?

4.3  Delete "Each".

5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option 
agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm 
interpretting it incorrectly.

5.3 (ii)  add "as provided in Section  5.5"

6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller 
would be charged interest if not timely paid.

10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?.

I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back 
option. You should have it today.

Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read 
before?  I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.  

Thanks,

Kay

Ben,

The unit deliveries that go with revised milestone 10 are units # 21&22 that
actually occur by March 30, 2001.  I've already pushed back payments as far
as I can for Units 19,20, 23, & 24, by splitting the 10% into two 5%
payments from the earlier agreed to 2/15 date.  So the deferral of 5% of
contract to 7/30/01 more than accomodates the later ship dates.  The value
for delaying ~ $ 17.5 mm for 75 days is already benefitting by $ 365,000
assuming 10% cost of money.  That's the best we can do.  Sorry if I didn't
make myself clear.

Please call if we need to discuss further before concluding the Change
Order.

Thanks,

Lee

Here is the blackline showing changes made from version 5.  Again, I
apologize for the delay.  As you can see, the blackline has deleted
certain section headings and internal section cites. I will have IT
debug version 6, so this shouldn't affect any future blacklines.

All,

 I would like to organize a sort of "kickoff" meeting of this group to (1) 
briefly outline obligations and other terms & conditions that would need to 
be included in an ENA/ESA commercial agreement  and (2) discuss steps that we 
need to take in the ENA WestLB facility to handle funding of some equipment 
configuration changes/additions that ESA would like for the earmarked 
machines.  I was hoping to find a time either Thursday (tomorrow) afternoon 
or Friday afternoon -- please let me know which time slots on these 
afternoons would not work for you and if you think that there are other 
individuals that would be essential to this meeting.

Thank-you,
Kevin Joyce

Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover 
page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page 
of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer 
if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective 
date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and 
WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until 
May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is 
for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the 
effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM 
acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the 
turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC 
contact for this transaction.

Regards, Lisa

Rebecca,

John Ayres and I met today.  He wishes to add the interconnect piping
between the chiller and cooling tower options in Exhibit N-2 for the ESA
Electrobolt Project.  This adds a total of $ 266,400 to the Jan 15, 2001
payment (equal to $ 33,280 per unit).  There will be no effect on the
12/27/00 payment amount.  I've edited your spread sheet to show this.

John Ayres asked if he could have a stripped down version of the Spread
sheet showing only the ESA amounts.

Kay, You'll notice that the Cooling Tower Option is Exhibit N-2 was changed
to add this interconnect piping to the scope.

I hope this helps.

Regards,

Lee

My prior e-mail was undeliverable.  Here is the message I had sent earlier 
this evening:  I hope to be e-mailing to you shortly a clean copy of the ABB 
Transformer Purchase and Sale Agreement, as well as a blackline showing the 
changes made from the WestdeutscheLB Agreement dated July 14, 2000.  We have 
run into some formatting problems, which we believe are due to problems of 
the system being able to read some of the formatting codes in the original 
WestdeutscheLB Agreement that we received via e-mail.  I hope to have these 
remedied shortly.

Lisa - regarding the movement of the turbines out of the WestLB structure 
into a South American power project:

I just got out of a meeting with the SA team doing the Elektrobolt (sp?) 
project development work. That is the "Rio Gen Merchant" project that the 8 
LM6000s are destined for.  Kay Mann (ENA lawyer who worked on the LM6000 
contract with GE), myself, Humberto Cubillos (ENA finance person who works 
with Lisa Bills on the WestLB structure), Kevin Joyce (ESA finance) and 
Herman Manis (ENA structuring accountant) will  need to coordinate any 
movement of turbines out of the WestLB structure.

I can get you electronic copies of both the MHI and S&S (LM6000) contracts, 
but would appreciate your coordinating with Kay, myself or Humberto before 
advising the developers as to any of the details of the move out of the S&S 
structure.  Kevin Joyce or myself should be contacted before advising the 
developers on the MHI structure.

Thanks,

Rose

Subject: Change order to the ABB transformer contract

Per our phone conversation, here is the latest copy I've seen of Change Order 
#1 to the ABB transformer contract.  Your document should be drafted as 
Change Order #2 and any additional costs should be added to the contract 
total of $7,503,600.00, as amended by Change Order #1.  I'm assuming you'll 
have one of the attorneys on the Fountain Valley project (Al Larsen?) look 
over the language and confirm that the first change order has been executed.

Attached please find the Fountain Valley/GE Facility Agreement and
Exhibits, as well as blacklines (the first two documents) showing
changes from the form documents.

To complete each, we will need:

1. The contact information for Sections 6.7.2, 25.1 and 25.3 of the
Agreement.

2. Please have the business team confirm the Purchase Amount and
the Guaranteed Delivery Dates.  The information that I pulled off of the
spreadsheet that you provided (which is the information incorporated in
the Agreement) is inconsistent with the information that Alan Larsen
provided.

3. Do we want to use the Exhibit B-1 (Specification) from the
original West LB Agreement for this deal?

4. Do we need Exhibit R (Schedule of Witness Test Points)?

5.  Exhibit H will be attached prior to execution.

Kay,

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

Thanks,

Lee

Attached is a revised version of the consent to assignment.  This version is 
specific to the ESA deal, but I'm told that the TurboPark version can be 
expected to be close to the same.

Kent, I'm awaiting final Enron input on the facility agreement as well, and I 
will let you know as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Peter/Kay-

Based on Lee's mark-up, he's caught on to the fact that I was trying to put 
in site conditions and performance guarantees that were specific to Austin as 
opposed to the generic ones we had in the original West LB contract.  At this 
stage of the game, I can live with the original guarantees.  He's changed all 
of the performance guarantees and some of the Basis Conditions in Exhibit A.  
To make everything agree, please make the following changes to Exhibit A:

Ambient Temperature should be 91 not 101 (Lee forgot to change this)

Elevation should be 0 not 435 (Lee's changes are okay here)

Barometric pressure should be 14.7 not 14.47 (Lee mismarked this one)

Ambient relative humidity should be 45 not 35 (Lee forgot to change this)

Exhaust Loss should be 6 not 12 (Lee's changes are okay here)

Hope this helps.  If you need to feel free to call me.  I will be in Austin 
on my cell phone all next week.  I'm in the office today.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

Lisa/Rose,

Attached is the most recent draft of the facility agreement for the 
LM6000's.  This version was prepared for the Austin project and therefore 
lacks any DevCo specific references or requirements. Your input as to any 
lender requirements, as well as the rights and responsibilities of the agent, 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay-

Per my previous email, at your earliest convenience, please issue a change 
order to Stewart & Stevenson for additional TD of I hours at Austin.  Listed 
below is my suggested wording:


Subject to Section 8.0 of Exhibit H-1of the Agreement, the Seller shall 
provide the Purchaser additional Technical Direction of Installation (TD of 
I) manhours and days of Per diem (for all four Units) as follows:

Straight Time (8 hrs/day):    640 manhours (total) @ $135.00/hour (US)
Overtime (excess of 8 hrs/Day Sundays, Holidays): 600 manhours (total) @ 
$165.00/hour (US)
Per diem:      104 days (total) @ $196.00/day (US)


Please feel free to "fine tune" my wording as required.  By the way, the 
number of hours and days listed above are a total for all four units, not per 
unit.  Even though the contract currently lists TD of I hours on a per Unit 
basis, I thought using a grand total would be less confusing for the change 
order because that's how we've been tracking hours. If this change order 
needs to list manhours and days of per diem on a per Unit basis as well, then 
go ahead and divide my totals by four to come up with a per Unit basis.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  I will be in Austin 
through Thursday of this week, but can be reached on my cell phone at (713) 
412-6873.  I will be back in the office on Friday.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

Hi Paul,

I would like to  change my previous response to this email.  I would like to 
get a cleaned up version of the GE contract (without WestLB references) so 
that I can make a wider internal distribution without having to explain the 
references to WestLB.

The intial read from GE was positive, but the devil is in the details, of 
course.

Kay

Subject: Re: ABB facility agrement

Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract; 
namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and 
30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be 
handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing 
matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked 
out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time 
and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising 
from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.  Regards, 
Paul

Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Santa just dropped this off.  It is the missing Exhibit B-1 electronic 
version for the GE Break out contract.  We are in the process of setting up 
arrangements with GE to supply Power System Stabilizers for the GTGs.
Until the Break Out Contract is finalized, it is best to call this a draft.

 <<City of Austin Gas Turbine Agt - Blackline of  83017 v.5 to v.7.DOC>>


 Attached is a blackline of the City of Austin Turbine Agreement
showing changes made to the version that went to GE on February 12. This
draft includes both Lee's and Eric's changes to Exhibit A, as well as
the addition of the contacts for notices in Sections 25.1 and 25.3.  It
also contains a few minor clean-up items identified by Lisa Bills when
she reviewed LV Cogen (e.g., the definitions of Performance Test
Certificate and Performance Test Completion Certificate were out of
order).  To complete the agreement, we will need to include the date of
execution and Exhibit H-2.  I particularly wanted Eric to review this
before it went to the other side.  If it looks acceptable, I would be
happy to send a copy to GE.

Kay Mann passed along your e-mail address when I asked about how I could be
of help in moving the Facility Agreement "breakout contract" forward.

I am working on a transaction that will require that we have the ability to
move two of the ten transformers Enron North America, as agent, purchased
from ABB.  The transaction is expected to be signed prior to the end of the
year.

The counterparty to our transaction has pressed us for a copy of the
contract under which the transformers will be conveyed.  I understand that
you have been working with Kay on the form of contract.  To the extent that
I can provide any input or can otherwise move the process along, I am
anxious to do so.

Please give me a call to discuss how we can move the process forwards.  I
can be reached at (503) 464-8863.

Thanks.

Here is the latest on this issue:

On Monday, Austin Energy asked if they could take early title certain 
equipment (the foxbourgh equipment - sp?) in order to "work around" an 
internal budget issue.  Apparently, if AE takes early title, they will be 
able to pay for the equipment (approx $440,000) from another fund and avoid 
the appearance of being over budget on the 4 LM project.
Based upon my discussions with various internal groups, ENA is comfortable 
with either option #2 or option #3 below.  See the tax response from Warren 
below.  David Marshall is comfortable from an insurance perspective.  Kay 
Mann (lawyer on GE breakout contract) confirmed in a voicemail that she did 
not anticipate the title transfer creating an issue with the warranties 
granted to ENA in the breakout agreement.
Keenan phoned Chris Kirksey yesterday to relay the message that based upon 
preliminary discussions, we are comfortable with either approach.

Next Steps:

Jeffrey anticipates hearing from Chris today to get preliminary feedback on 
if Austin needs title (option #3) or if the "acknowledgement letter" (option 
#2) would suffice.
Monday, December 4, there is an internal meeting to discuss the topic.


Let me know if you have any thoughts or concerns.

Regards,

Eric

Eric:

Regarding the various scenarios you discussed I think the best, from a 
property tax prospective, is proposal #2.  It is not reasonable to think that 
the taxing authorities will overlook the property as discussed in #1.  The 
City of Austin is a taxing unit within Travis County and there is a good 
possibility that they will go after the value and assess it all to ENA.  We 
would be in a much stronger position if we took the proactive approach with 
an agreement as discussed in #2, and if the question was ever raised we would 
have the explanation in our "hip pocket".

Please call me if you have any questions at 30689.

Subject: Update: Austin Project Property Tax Issue


Gentleman,

I have discussed the property tax issue with Billy Lemmons, Stuart Zisman, 
Ben Jacoby and Jeff Keenan.   A couple of thoughts came to mind and we need 
your opinion on these matters so we can take the most appropriate steps 
necessary to reduce the potential tax liability.

First, a couple of facts for clarification:

It is anticipated the turbines (and transformers) will be on the City of 
Austin site on or before 12/31/00 (the City owns the land);
It is anticipated ENA will be the legal owner of the assets on 12/31/00 (the 
NEPCO assignment will not be complete);
Under the current participation agreement, the City of Austin will not take 
title to their 91.4% ownership until the plant is complete and successfully 
tested (sometime 1Q 2001);
However, by 12/31/00 the City of Austin will have paid for 100% of their 
ownership in the plant ($85,641,800);
The tax liability could be $250,000 per turbine, $1,000,000 in total.

The thoughts/ideas are as follows:

Is it reasonable to assume the Travis County taxing authorities will not tax 
the equipment at all because it will be located on land owned by the City of 
Austin at year end?  What is the probability they will actually review items 
of the property and trace legal owner?
If #1 above is a risky position, and one you would not support, would it be 
acceptable to the taxing authorities, in your opinion,  for ENA and the City 
of Austin to sign a letter stating that ENA is simply holding title to the 
equipment for the benefit of the City of Austin.  Therefore, because of this 
and the fact that the City has paid for its 91.4% ownership, only the 8.6% is 
taxable.
If neither #1 or #2 are acceptable in you view, would it be acceptable for 
ENA and Austin sign a side letter agreement to officially convey 91.4% of the 
project to the City of Austin, but totally indemnify the City of Austin from 
all liabilities.  After year-end, ENA would "take back" the conveyance and 
the plant would continue in ENA's name until the plant is officially 
conducted its final performance tests.

Please provide your thoughts on these ideas as soon as possible.  If these do 
not work, we need some creative thinking on your behalf to minimize the 
liability.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards, 

Eric

Subject: ESA equipment purchase

Ben,

Here's a draft of an MOU for the sale of the LMs and ABB equipment to ESA.  
One issue is when this transaction can close.  Since the equipment is owned 
by WestLB and since the feeling is we don't want to involve WestLB in the 
transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the 
WestLB facility.  If another approach is preferred, we will need to circle 
back with Lisa.

A second issue I see is with the concept that GE will need to look to both 
ENA (or WestLB's successor) for some of the payments, but look to ESA for 
payment for changes, storage, etc.  As far as I know, this concept hasn't 
been addressed with GE.

I re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out.

I look forward to your comments.
 
Kay

Subject: LM6000 Title Transfer Question

Ben,

Does ENA wish to accept Title of 14 LM6000's on September 26, 2000, or accept 
Title of these Units after each has been issued an Inspection Acceptance 
Certificate from EECC QA/QC department?


The following is a summary of the LM6000 Title Transfer Question:

Mike Storm, GE/SSEP Project Manager, requested from me, on 9/19/00, to accept 
title of 14 LM6000's no later 9/26/00.  I informed him I was not authorized 
to make this decision and that I would contact the Owner to make the 
decision.  I further informed Mike Storm that our Owner would not accept 
those terms and a compromise must be worked out. 
Contract Reference 15.2.1 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: title transfers 
when equipment is ready to ship to the delivery point and seller notifies 
purchaser of such event.
Delivery Point is defined as the SSEP storage yard.
SSEP has notified us that Units #1-14 are "Ready to Ship".
Contract Reference 10.2.3 of contract 24-LM6K-2-99 states: purchaser has the 
right to inspect the equipment for "completeness prior to loading on 
transport to delivery point".
We have inspected the first eleven Units and have informed SSEP that Units 
#1-14 ARE NOT COMPLETE and therefore are NOT at the Delivery Point.
FACT: Units # 1-11 are at the delivery point. #12-14 are at SSEP.
FACT: If we sent a truck to SSEP tomorrow, NONE of the UNITS would be "Ready 
to Ship" to a project site.
FACT: SSEP QA/QC has 15 Non Conformance Reports on these 14 turbines which 
need to be corrected before they are "Ready to Ship".
It is in the best interests for both companies to correct the Non 
Conformance's prior to shipment to the delivery point or project site.
RECOMMENDATION: I recommend that we DO NOT accept Title until the Units are 
actually ready to be shipped to a project site.  The problem is that NONE OF 
THE UNITS ARE READY TO SHIP!  SSEP has to work off punchlist items which 
their QA/QC department has listed on Non Conformance Reports.  At this 
juncture, no money can be withheld from SSEP. To ensure they will be fixed, 
Title should transfer after our QA/QC inspectors give written notice that 
each Unit is complete and ready to ship.  This will protect ENA on the 
quality of the machines, as well as, ensure that little or no "re-work" is 
performed in the field.

If you require further information or any assistance in this matter, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-646-8258.

Here is the latest version of the Enron South America Break-Out Turbine
Contract that I received from Rob Taylor.  I am working on a new version
that will incorporate the specific guarantees into the body of the
agreement.  When I send a blackline, I will run it against version 2,
which is the last version that I sent to you.  That way, you'll be able
to see my changes as well as Rob Taylor's changes.

Lisa,

Thank you for the timely comments.

Credit support.  On the issue of credit support for a project company 
partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds 
an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past 
with an Enron project company.  Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are 
different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have 
received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are 
ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have 
received 95% of the payment.  In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each 
ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.

Effective date.  The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to 
capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in 
order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.  In the GE contract we 
addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work 
performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make 
the effective date a current one.

 Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest 
option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since 
the data sheets have changed.  

Hope this was helpful.

Kay

Subject: ABB Agreement for Review

Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) "WestLB" should be changed to "Purchaser"
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not 
"Purchaser's"
2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Regards, Lisa

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:



I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay

Kay,
 Attached is the LM 6000 and options scope that ESA has prepared, that will 
be input to our MOU.  It does not reflect the scope of equipment that will be 
procured from ABB yet; this should be forthcoming.  Also below is the current 
cost estimate of the machines with their S&S options and the ABB scope.  
Please let us know what other information regarding scope that you might 
need.  

Thanks,
Kevin

Chris, attached is the total scope to S&S.  From this list you should be able 
to make your change order to S&S base on purchased quantities versus required 
quantities.  I have provided you the required quantities.  
I provided you a column for the delta cost to S&S.  When you are finished, 
please complete the spreadsheet for all of our records.  I do not know how we 
are to add cost for storage either.
Thanks,

Subject: S&S (GE) Scope of Supply Cost

Here are the total cost for the S&S scope of supply for the Electrobolt 
Project.  I have not included any ENA burdens or storage cost.  These cost 
are from purchase order with ENA to S&S.
                                                                              
                                                                              
     EIGHT MACHINES               EACH
The total cost of the LM 6000's, sprint package, water injection 
skid                = $112,855,600  or $14,106,950 each
The total cost of options (chillers stacks, cooling tower, mod. buildings, 
etc. =     13,309,400  or      1,663,675 each
                                                                              
                                               Totals                = $ 
126,165,000 or   $15,770,625 each

The transformers from ABB in Brazil should cost $3,200,000. total in Brazil 
without shipping to the site.     

Hope this helps you with the WLB bucket.
John

Hi again.

Here is the consent to assignment which I believe is ready to go.  The only 
changes I made was adding the requirement to give notice of the financing in 
3 (f), and making the release of WestLB specific to these turbines (1(b)).  

I will bring signature pages tomorrow, and will forward the override letter 
this evening.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks,

Kay

     Attached please find clean copies of the LV Cogen Agreement and
Exhibits. The Agreement incorporates my changes as well as Dale's and
incorporates the site specific performance guarantees.  The blackline of
the agreement shows changes made form the original form agreed to by GE.
The blackline of the exhibits is against the version I received last
night from Dale.

To finalize the Agreement, we will need the following:

1. The location of Purchaser's offices in the opening paragraph.

2. The Agreement Reference in section 6.7.1.

3. The address for invoices in section 6.7.2.

4. The information regarding notices in sections 25.1 and 25.3.

Pursuant to earlier conversations on other agreements, I have removed
the reference to Exhibits N-1 and N-3 and included actual amounts in the
text of the Agreement.


To finalize the exhibits, we need the following:

1. Do we need anything in Section B of Schedule A-1?

2. Exhibits B-1 (Specification), H-2 (Training) and R (Schedule of
Witness Test Points) need to be provided.

3. Please confirm for Exhibit T, that ENA has received all
information that it should have received.

4. To the extent required, we need a Seller Parent Guaranty for
Exhibit C-1.

Kay:

Just to let you know I am supposed to have the copies of the LM6K purchase 
agreement today and was planning to distribute them today.  I thought I'd 
deliver the Bank's original to Roseann along with a copy.

I'll send her an electronic copy also.

Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday.  He put the info 
about the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in para. 2 and used more 
defined terms from the ADA.

I think we can use the same A&A agreement to notify WestLB of our intent to 
assign the P.O. and give notice as to the closing date.  However, the current 
form of A&A agreement has sig. blocks for only ENA and WestLB.  Seems like 
you need a sig. for the assuming party!  Particularly since that party is 
purporting to give notice to WestLB of its intent to pay the purchase price!



Rose


To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures 
the following needs to take place:



1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option.  On at least 5 (five) days notice 
to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and 
ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity.  This assignment (the 
"Assignment")  must release the Lessor (WestLB)  from all its obligations 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment 
and ancillary agreements.  This means that GE Packaged Power (a division of 
GE) and other vendors must release WestLB from its obligations with respect 
to the subject equipment and contracts.  (Kay - Could this be done by an 
amendment to the scheduled equipment under the various agreements between 
WestLB and the various vendors? Rose - I believe so, along with entering into 
the new contracts reference in 3))  

The assignment agreement to effect this is explained below and can be 
prepared by Kay, Rose or Rob.

2) ADA - Closing of the Purchase Option.  WestLB requires at least 5 (five) 
days written notice of the exercise of the purchase option and  this notice 
can be included in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.   The purchase 
price for the subject equipment and agreements will be the "Termination 
Amount" as defined in the ADA, as allocable to the subject equipment and 
contracts.  This amount is equal to the sum of i) the aggregate outstanding 
amount of the Advances, plus ii) any Transaction Expenses then due and owing. 
plus iii) all accrued amounts due on any Lessor Yield or Facility Fee, plus 
iv) any amounts owed for any costs reasonably incurred by the Lessor with 
respect to the subject equipment and contracts.  The particular amounts of 
the foregoing costs and fees allocable to the subject equipment and contracts 
should be determined in coordination with Lisa Bills and Humberto Cubillos.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement  used to consummate the Purchase 
Option is attached as Exhibit G to the ADA and can be prepared by Kay, Rose 
or Rob.  It needs to be executed by ENA, ENA's Designee as assignee and 
WestLB.  A detailed list of the equipment and contracts being assigned must 
be prepared by the assignee and attached to the assignment. 


3) Assignment under the Turbine Purchase Agreement.  The Purchaser (WestLB) 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement (the "Turbine Contract") may assign a 
portion of its rights and obligations under the Turbine Contract to an 
affiliate of ENA without the Seller's consent.  Kay has structured the 
Turbine Contract to allow the assignee to enter into separate purchase 
agreements with GE Packaged Power for the equipment being assigned.   The 
documents to transfer title of the equipment from WestLB (in the case of 
equipment that is already fabricated) , or to replace ENA with another 
business unit on the purchase agreement (in the case of WIP turbines) should 
be prepared by the business unit attorneys involved in the transfer, based on 
a form of contract which is very similiar to the Master Purchase Agreement. 

 The tax specialists from both ENA and the acquiring business units should be 
advised as to the planned date of title transfer.  

 Same generally holds true for the ABB transformers, except that the 
assignment to an Enron SPV may require a form of security.

Kay,

I had a copy of the last redline for Exhibit B-1.  Don't have execution
copy.

On Exhibit h-2, Training -- I'll look for it, but think Kathy had it last to
identify it as H-2.

Thanks,

Lee (and others),

Exhibit B is the EECC spec, right? I do not know if I have an electronic
version.  If locating it is a problem, we can copy what we have unless
there is some reason to handle it otherwise.

Exhibit H-2 is the S & S training program dated 2/3/00.  Lee/Mike, do you
have more copies of that document that we can attach?

Folks,

John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for the
ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on Guarantee
Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change to
the Emissions Test Exhibit.

John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2,
this
is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
circulation.

Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope
of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability
amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed
delivery schedule for purchased options.

This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire
contract
document.


Regards,

Lee

Ben/Mike/Jeff,

Here is a quick update and a request for your assistance:

On Wednesday, November 22, ENA sent West LB a 5-day notice indicating our 
intent to exercise the purchase option by Friday.
On Friday, November 30, ENA will execute the purchase option and at that time 
own the 4 turbines for the Austin project.
Hopefully, by the end of the week, ENA and GE will execute the breakout 
agreement which will ensure, primarily, that the GE warranties attached to 
the 4 Austin turbines are completely conveyed to ENA.

Attached is the latest draft of the GE Breakout agreement between ENA and GE. 
 In order to complete the breakout agreement, the lawyers need you guys to 
review section 10 regarding site specific performance guarantees and provide 
comments.  Also, please let us (Kay Mann and myself) know what Exhibit F and 
U should contain.  The GE lawyers indicated they would provide the first 
draft soon.

Let us know you thoughts as soon as possible.

Regards,

Eric

1. For the recitals, the kW capacity of its plant and  the location
of the plant.

2. All exhibits, including Exhibit N-3 (which is the original price
for each unit) and Exhibit U, which contains the Site specific material.
The Table of Contents should then be run to include all of the exhibits.

Kay,
Below are the prices as well as the ex-work factory dates (ship dates).  As 
Ben
and Frank and I discussed last Friday this is what we need the option 
extension
to the 30th of June to reflect.  Please give me a call when you can.  We need 
to
get this done this PM if at all possible.  Frank and I will both be out of our
offices for the rest of the week and this will get very difficult.

Thanks

Subject:  LM 6000 Transformers


Ben,
     This note is based on the information provided to me earlier today by 
Mike
Sandridge and confirms what the adjusted values would be for each tarnsformer
type, making the following conditions:

1-The quantity of transformers released under the agreement would be decreased
to 10.
2-The option payments for the ten production slots have been deducted, as 
shown
below, along with the remaining net price / each transformer type.
3- Two of the $50,000 non-refundable optional production slot payments  are
cancelled. (LNL 9521-3 and 4)
4- In order to meet the terms of the latest agreement, the contract should be
signed by June 19,2000.  If that is not practical, at a minimum, the 10%
progress payment against the value of the contract would be due for wire
transfer immediately. That value would be 10% of $7,884,600 = $788,460.00.


     Therefore the Equipment Pricing Table is revised as shown below.

I have finally reviewed the below.  Comments:

In the 2nd recital to begin and elsewhere where stated, we need to build in 
flexibility for other ancillary equipment besides the ABB Transformers.

What do we do about selling the equipment for more or less than what's due 
WestLB?  How will the money flow?  What accounting impact will this have?

Regards, Lisa

Unfortunately, this is the best of the blacklines.  It has lost the
section numbering, but does reflect changes made to the text.  I will
have my secretary forward to you a clean copy of Version 6 momentarily.

Hi Guys,

In a conversation with GE today, they indicated that they thought it would be 
appropriate to insert the performance values in the text of the document, and 
do away with the exhibit.  Frankly, I like that approach also.  Could you 
please make that revision and resend the document?

Thanks,

Kay

The only ABB change order I know about is the one that cancelled two 
transformers.  It has been signed by ABB  but not Enron, but it is agreed.  
It resulted in a cancellation charge of around $350,000, and obviously 
lowered the contract value.  I'll get a copy and send it to you.

Subject: Change order to the ABB transformer contract

Per our phone conversation, here is the latest copy I've seen of Change Order 
#1 to the ABB transformer contract.  Your document should be drafted as 
Change Order #2 and any additional costs should be added to the contract 
total of $7,503,600.00, as amended by Change Order #1.  I'm assuming you'll 
have one of the attorneys on the Fountain Valley project (Al Larsen?) look 
over the language and confirm that the first change order has been executed.

Please keep me updated as well on the expected timing for bringing the LM 
6000s into the new So American structure.  It needs to be done soon in order 
to attract the club banks by year end.  Thanks!

Ben and Brett -

I do not know your target timing to move the LMs; however, you need to be 
aware that funding from the bank structure to pay for them requires that we 
go through a full second closing process.  It may take several days to pull 
together all the documents and information needed for this closing - we will 
have to deliver Brazil counsel opinions, Cayman counsel opinions, another A&K 
opinion and deliver a multitude of other corporate and security documents too 
boring to list here. 

So - as soon as:

1)  the break-out contract is ready; 

2) GE is on board; and 

3) ESA, ENA and WLB have signed off on the purchase option transfer 
document(s) (which must include Matt,  Mary Kimball and Mary Cilia 
sign-off),  

we can finalize the "second closing" docs for the bank - we have already 
started on them, but it will take a focused effort to finish them and receive 
all signatures necessary.  

Ben and Brett must let Rob Taylor of A&K - at 713-220-4436 know when the 
above items are complete - he will need to coordinate with the team to push 
for final docs.

Lisa Alfaro - will you please coordinate with Rob Taylor at the above number 
and Frederico Porto at A&K in Dallas at 214-659-4447 on the Brazil-based 
issues? 
 
I also ask that Ben and Brett be available to the deal team to consult and 
answer questions as necessary.

I am going to be out of town for a week on another year-end deal and will 
check my voice mails regularly.   My assistant, Melba Trevino at 835-7664 
will have my contact details.

Please call Rob, me or Tammy (345-3870) with any questions.


Rose

I've made changes to the attached document. I modified the prior draft so 
that the Purchase Amount is reduced by the full amount of the two 
transformers being cancelled ($1.572 million), and so that the Cancellation 
Charge of $323,200 be paid upon execution of the Change Order.

Kay, if you're OK with this, please forward to Sandridge for ABB's review and 
approval.

Regards,

Ben

I agree with Stuart regarding the preference for the Assignment, Bill of Sale 
and Conveyance.  It is a little confusing as to why AE, who was a party to 
the original Participation Agreement, is not a party to a change in that 
agreement.  This being said, the Conveyance, in my opinion, is cleaner and 
has a better chance of being executed in a timely manner, which is the 
essence of the property tax issue.

This is probably very minor, but do we need to address any equipment that has 
not been purchased to date?  Jeff, what have not we purchased yet?

Regards,

Eric

Subject: Austin Energy Amendments


In response to the attached email, I told Hal that I would prefer the 
Assignment, Bill of Sale and Conveyance.  To me, that is easier and cleaner 
(a tax auditor would likely be more comfortable with a simple document that 
unconditionally demonstrates conveyance of title).  It is also consistent 
with our discussion of the other day (except now ENA is conveying the 
remaining interest in Enron Sandhill Limited Partnership (which actually 
makes sense)).

Please provide any comments that you might have ASAP.

Stuart

Attached are two approaches to transferring title from ENA, as
contractor, to Austin Energy and Sandhill, as owner, to the equipment
and other materials to be incorporated into the project. I believe
either approach works.

1. Assignment, Bill of Sale, and Conveyance.  This document transfers
title from ENA to Austin Energy and Sandhill in the percentages that
they own the facility under the Participation Agreement. It would be
executed only by ENA.


2. Second Amendment to EPC Contract.  I have added a new paragraph 4 to
the existing proposed Second Amendment to EPC Contract. This paragraph
amends Section 7.8(a) of the EPC Contract to provide that title passes
when the owner pays ENA for the equipment but no later than December 15,
2000.

Please let me know which approach you believe would be preferable.

Thanks, Hal.

Hi Guys,

This is just intended to be a list of issues to be addressed in each project 
specific contract - a "to do" list to finish each one.

Dale and Kay:

Lee and I looked at the proposed site specific letter and we wondered if
what Dale did for the summary sheet may not be a better format.  Dale, can
you forward it to the Kay and I to look at and consider.

Thanks.

Kent

The only things I can think of needed to close each of the Facility
Agreements are:

1. side letter, which should have a release of ENA and West LB
under the original agreement, an acknowledgement and agreement that
Purchaser constitutes a permitted assignee under Section 22.2 of the
West LB Agreement, and an acknowledgement and agreement that the
GE/Purchaser Agreement constitutes a Facility Agreement under the West
LB Agreement.  The side letter might also set forth any ENA takeover
rights in the event of a Purchaser default.

2. spare parts need to be dealt with

3. the Site specific language needs to be provided for each
Facility Agreement (as identified in our prior memo)

4. the other blanks in the individual Facility Agreements need to
be filled in

5. the technical/business team needs to review the exhibits for
each Facility Agreement

Hi Mike,

Here's a draft of the facility agreement for your review.  

Thanks,

PS I think I have a redline somewhere.  I'll check.

Eric-

I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those changes 
are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 
as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to 
exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they 
typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it 
anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined 
cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, 
then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and 
their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust 
guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.

Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to 
your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I 
therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a 
separate word file. 

Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in my 
hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something from 
GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.  

If you have questions, give me a call.  (67550)  I will be in Ausitn 
Wednesday and Thursday, but will be available by cell phone (713) 412-6873.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

Gentlemen,

I'm attaching what we are calling an override letter to accompany the 
breakout contracts.  This letter is intended to preserve the lender 
requirements/accounting treatment from the WestLB agreement so long as the 
equipment is a part of the financing package.

I believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment, but we are 
still discussing Mike's version internally.

Kent, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow at 300 CST.  If you would 
like to discuss any of this in the am, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Kay

Lee, Chris and Kay:

Attached is a draft of the Change Order #3 for the Las Vegas Cogen project.
Kay, I will be in Houston on Monday through Wednesday afternoon, but will be
busy most of Tuesday.  Lee had hoped that we could get together, or at least
talk, about this and the facility agreement and payment for Change Order #2.

Kay:

Here are our comments for meeting.  Sorry I couldn't get them to you earlier
but Lee and I couldn't talk before now.  We meant to just talk them all
through anyway as you can see.  Maybe you've got more.

Our biggest concern is that the law firm seems to keep wanting to make the
document better, when they should just leave it the way it is.  We certainly
can see who pays them.

ESA change order, contract disaggegation, etc.)?

John:

As I've mentioned to you, Brett, and Lee Johnson on numerous occasions, ENA 
needs to have formal sign-off on the change order via an authorization letter 
(not an e-mail) to be attached to the executed change order. I've asked Kay 
Mann (ENA legal) to contact ESA legal to put this letter together. This 
should not be difficult at all. It is important that we do this because ENA 
is not willing to take any risk through oversight or administrative error on 
anybody's part that a mistake is made on the contents of any ESA change 
orders that ENA must execute because we are the contract counterparty with GE 
/ ABB. 

Please have ESA legal contact Kay Mann at x5-7566 to put this together. As 
far as I'm concerned, this is the only item we are waiting for.

Lastly, I left you a message early last week regarding the transformer 
contract but have not heard form you. As such, I assume that any questions 
you might have had on option premiums etc. with respect to the transformers 
has been answered.

Regards,

Ben

Subject: Issuance Of Change Orders To GE-S&S and to ABB - Electrbolt Project

I just finished a meeting with S&S and was informed that a change order nor 
any formal notice has not been issued to them yet.  This information was sent 
to Chris August 28,2000 and I know he forwarded it on the next day to 
Purchasing.
Can someone tell me what and why this has not been issued?  I would 
appreciate this as we cannot tolerate delays.
Also, the ABB material was hand carried to Chris on Oct. 5, 2000.  This type 
of delay encountered on the S&S order will jeopardize our ability to complete 
this project on schedule.
Thanks,
John

Attached please find a clean copy of the Enron South America Turbine
Facility Agreement, which incorporates the specific performance
guarantees that had been included in Exhibit U.   The attached blackline
shows these changes as well as those made by Rob Taylor.  I have run the
blackline against version 2, which was the last version that I had sent
to you.

We are still missing the Agreement Reference in Section 6.7.1.  I will
send the revised exhibits (i.e., without Exhibit U) momentarily.

if you executed it rather than Janet since it pertains to one of your 
projects. If you have any issues / changes / questions, let me know. Also let 
me know if you need any assistance regarding the DASH for this change order.

I suggest the changes as shown on the attached.  

Chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a 
certain specification.



I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.  I'm referring to 
these as "Equipment" and part of the "Units" so it is clear that the 
warranties apply.

Is there any change to the sound guaranty level (or other guarantees) for the 
units utilizing these stacks?

Subject: Turbines Galore

Rob made some changes in the e-mail I sent last Friday.  He put the info 
about the Assignment and Assumption Agreement in para. 2 and used more 
defined terms from the ADA.

I think we can use the same A&A agreement to notify WestLB of our intent to 
assign the P.O. and give notice as to the closing date.  However, the current 
form of A&A agreement has sig. blocks for only ENA and WestLB.  Seems like 
you need a sig. for the assuming party!  Particularly since that party is 
purporting to give notice to WestLB of its intent to pay the purchase price!



Rose


To effectuate the movement of turbines out of the WestLB LM6000 structures 
the following needs to take place:



1) ADA - Assignment of the Purchase Option.  On at least 5 (five) days notice 
to WestLB, ENA will assign the Purchase Option for the subject equipment and 
ancillary agreement to the purchasing entity.  This assignment (the 
"Assignment")  must release the Lessor (WestLB)  from all its obligations 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement with respect to the subject equipment 
and ancillary agreements.  This means that GE Packaged Power (a division of 
GE) and other vendors must release WestLB from its obligations with respect 
to the subject equipment and contracts.  (Kay - Could this be done by an 
amendment to the scheduled equipment under the various agreements between 
WestLB and the various vendors? Rose - I believe so, along with entering into 
the new contracts reference in 3))  

The assignment agreement to effect this is explained below and can be 
prepared by Kay, Rose or Rob.

2) ADA - Closing of the Purchase Option.  WestLB requires at least 5 (five) 
days written notice of the exercise of the purchase option and  this notice 
can be included in the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.   The purchase 
price for the subject equipment and agreements will be the "Termination 
Amount" as defined in the ADA, as allocable to the subject equipment and 
contracts.  This amount is equal to the sum of i) the aggregate outstanding 
amount of the Advances, plus ii) any Transaction Expenses then due and owing. 
plus iii) all accrued amounts due on any Lessor Yield or Facility Fee, plus 
iv) any amounts owed for any costs reasonably incurred by the Lessor with 
respect to the subject equipment and contracts.  The particular amounts of 
the foregoing costs and fees allocable to the subject equipment and contracts 
should be determined in coordination with Lisa Bills and Humberto Cubillos.

The Assignment and Assumption Agreement  used to consummate the Purchase 
Option is attached as Exhibit G to the ADA and can be prepared by Kay, Rose 
or Rob.  It needs to be executed by ENA, ENA's Designee as assignee and 
WestLB.  A detailed list of the equipment and contracts being assigned must 
be prepared by the assignee and attached to the assignment. 


3) Assignment under the Turbine Purchase Agreement.  The Purchaser (WestLB) 
under the Turbine Purchase Agreement (the "Turbine Contract") may assign a 
portion of its rights and obligations under the Turbine Contract to an 
affiliate of ENA without the Seller's consent.  Kay has structured the 
Turbine Contract to allow the assignee to enter into separate purchase 
agreements with GE Packaged Power for the equipment being assigned.   The 
documents to transfer title of the equipment from WestLB (in the case of 
equipment that is already fabricated) and  to replace ENA with another 
business unit on the purchase agreement should be prepared by the business 
unit attorneys involved in the transfer, based on a form of contract which is 
very similiar to the Master Purchase Agreement. (Rose - the assignee/new 
owner needs to step into the turbine contract even if title has  passed to 
WestLB, as there are lots of rights (warranty, indemnity) the new owner needs 
to have.  It seems to me that you would transfer title in the assignment, 
then step into the remainder of the other rights in the new contract - a/k/a 
facility agreement.  Then you delete the assigned equipment from the Master 
Agreement.)

 The tax specialists from both ENA and the acquiring business units should be 
advised as to the planned date of title transfer.  

 Same generally holds true for the ABB transformers, except that the 
assignment to an Enron SPV may require a form of security.

(second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below)
showing changes made to the March 27 version. I have included Lee's
changes to the performance values in Sections 10.7 and 10.8  In addition
I have made changes to the Maximum Liability, Unit Liability and
Purchase Amounts and payment schedule. For the Guaranteed Delivery
dates, I have used the Ready to Ship Dates contained in the Agreement in
Principle.  To complete the agreement, we will need to insert the date
of execution and Exhibit H-2.

		 Subject: Austin - LM6000 Scope of supply

This past Wednesday during our weekly site visit, I explained to Austin 
Energy that I could not give them the whole LM6000 contract for 
confidentiality reasons, especially with respect to the commercial 
sections.   They were okay with that, but did make one last (and polite) 
request for a list of the scope items that they would be getting.  What I 
would propose to send is Exhibit B and B-1 from the contract (see attached).  
Exhibit B is a simple bulleted scope of supply list.  Exhibit B-1 is a simple 
spec that we wrote for the turbine which is itself a glorified scope document.

Let me know if this is something that I can forward to Austin Energy.  If the 
attached document still gives someone heartburn, I'll end it here and 
politely decline with Austin Energy.

Thanks,
Eric

This is the most current clean version of the GE breakout contract.  You have 
also received a list of site specific references in the contract to assist in 
the preparation of the final document.  

I will contact Kent Shoemaker today to see how close we are on the form.  It 
is my understanding that the lawyers involved in the projects will take the 
laboring oar once the form is ready to go.

I'll let you know as soon as I hear something from GE.  I am also trying to 
set up a meeting with ABB today or tomorrow.  I will send you the current 
version of that contract as well, although we have not had any input from ABB 
on it yet.

No issues from an accounting structuring perspective.  

Since we are exercising the purchase option, I assume Enron is comfortable 
putting four turbines on the balance sheet (actually netted in Costs in 
Excess of Billings/ Billings in Excess of Costs pursuant to accounting for 
construction contracts).

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks.

Re: Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption Agreement for Austin turbines
I've added the equipment description in Schedule 1 and changed the date of 
the agreement to November 30, 2000 (see attached redlined version).
Ben/Eric - can you verify that my unit numbers in Schedule 1 match your list 
of unit numbers?
David - can you sign off on this for accounting?
Once we have sign-off from accounting, we can circulate the document once 
more with Winston & Strawn.  Hopefully it should be in pretty good shape by 
tomorrow.  Thanks,

I'm circulating some language for the ABB transformer purchase agreement. =
=20
Please let me know if you have any problem with the language.

The buy back language is new.  The assignment language is intended to addre=
ss=20
some concerns raised by ABB - the changes are marked in red.

Buy back option.  (5.4.3)

At Purchaser=01,s option, Seller will arrange for storage of the Unit or Un=
its=20
to be stored for up to one year following the successful conclusion of=20
factory testing.  Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Amount in full, and will=
=20
pay the actual storage charges, billed quarterly during the year the Unit o=
r=20
Units are stored.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Purchaser during th=
is=20
storage period.  Purchaser shall have the right (but not the obligation) to=
=20
sell the Unit(s) back to Seller for 30% of Purchase Amount of the Unit(s)=
=20
after the end of the one year storage period.  Payment will be due 30 days=
=20
after receipt of written notification by Purchaser of its intent to exercis=
e=20
this option.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Seller as of the time of=
=20
payment.

If Purchaser desires to sell the Unit(s) prior to the expiration of the one=
=20
year storage period, Purchaser may request, and Seller agrees to act, as=20
broker for the re-sale of the Unit(s). The terms of the remarketing agreeme=
nt=20
will be subject to mutual agreement.


Changes to assignment language.


22.2   Assignment by Purchaser.  This Agreement or any right or obligation=

contained herein may be assigned, from time to time, by Purchaser without=

liabilities under this Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, =

I would recommend that we not insert Eric's comments regarding the
exhaust temperature and energy guarantees for combined cycle facilities.
As Eric indicates, this is a simple cycle plant, which is similar to
Fountain Valley.  When commenting on the Fountain Valley agreement, Lee
recommended that all references to exhaust temperature and energy
guarantees be stricken and we did so.  In addition, Lee has already seen
a version of the City of Austin agreement that had Sections 10.4.1 and
10.4.3 (the sections Eric would like to reinstated) stricken. Let me
know what you think, but I recommend we leave them out, particularly if
such sections are not necessary and would only be useful to have in the
future if the plant ever went combined cycle.

Here's what Eric wrote:


I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those
changes
are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and
10.4.3 as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were
related
to exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant
and
they typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would
guarantee
it anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes
combined
cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that
out, then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and
10.4.4
(and their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust
guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.

Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached
to
your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I
therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a
separate word file.

Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in
my
hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something
from GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.

Hi Dave,

I received a signed change order from Randy Milcer (not sure about that)
yesterday.  The form he signed indicates that ABB will be paying Enron, and
has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled
transformers ($400 off).  With your permission I will substitute the
correct version so ABB gets the money.

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is the most recent draft I have of the change order for the ESA 
stuff.  I think we need to add the info on drawing numbers and delivery dates 
for the options, much like we did on change order #2.



Please let me know what you think.

Peter/Kay,

Attached is revised ESA Facility Agreement.  This includes the Optional
Electric Output Guarantee for the Brazil site conditions.  Since the spread
between the 8 unit average guarantee and the single unit is greater than in
the base contract the LD sample calc needed some work, which I took care of.

Kay/Kent,

I also took a swipe at the 17.4 Termination language rework. See if I what I
came up with works...if so, we can use on all other Facility Agreements.

I've added John Ayres to distribution.  John and I will be reviewing the
contract Monday AM at 8:30 in his office.  Kay, it would be good if you
could join us ...as we're in the home stretch.  Also, can you send Peter the
remaining Exhibits he requested (B-1 and H-2).

    Attached please find a clean and blackline of the latest draft of
the Enron South America Break-Out Agreement.  The only changes made to
this version is the addition of today's date and the 72/25 split of
Change Order 3 in Section 6.2.  We are still missing the Agreement
Reference in section 6.7.1.  We haven't made any changes to the exhibits
since the last time they were circulated.  I will pull them out of our
Houston database and circulate them shortly.

Hi Mike,

Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to 
transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by 
the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.  I would have sent 
this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.

Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to 
get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them 
contractually allocated to various projects.  Please give me a call or have 
Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Re: LM6K Change Order #2 Revised  

Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover 
page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page 
of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer 
if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective 
date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and 
WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until 
May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is 
for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the 
effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM 
acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the 
turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC 
contact for this transaction.

The summary for the Las Vegas LM 6000 turbines is attached.  This reflects 
GE's final comments on the numbers (both performance and dollars), and is 
ready to deliver after attaching the following:

 (1)  I have overnighted to Ron's attention the 1" or so stack of exhibits 
from the master contract.  Pricing and spares have been deleted.
 (2)  The payment schedule for the 4 machines.  Kent Shoemaker said that Ben 
J. should have the payment schedule.


Bill:  The performance numbers have been changed from those in the master 
agreement to adjust for altitude and the decrease in water injection.  Please 
confirm that these are correct.

P.S.  Sheila is right--you just have to stay on these guys until you get what 
you want out of them.  Kind of like bull riding, I guess . . . .

Kay, I will be in Houston on Monday through Wednesday afternoon, but will be
busy most of Tuesday.  Lee had hoped that we could get together, or at least
talk, about this and the facility agreement and payment for Change Order #2.
How is your late Monday afternoon looking?

Comments on above agreement:

Has Herman Manis or an ENA transaction support person read this agreement and 
signed off?

1.B. - Realistically, ESA will not be ready to execute their ESA Option by 
November 12th.  We are negotiating w/ WestLB to extend our facility until 
Dec. 31, 2000.

1.C. - The ESA Option Consideration does not read like an "option payment" 
nor do the amounts look like option premiums.  This section needs to be 
vetted with ENA and ESA transaction support to insure that there are no 
problems.  Our normal option requirements with vendors may not be required 
here since internal and all assets already off balance sheet.

1.C. - As the WestLB facility is currently drafted, ESA would have to provide 
us their "purchase option election" by tomorrow, Oct. 12th.  I am having that 
extended in the current Nov. 12 maturity deal until 5 - 10 days before Nov 
12th.  WestLb has not agreed to this yet.  The purchase date can be 5 days 
after we provide notice of purchase under the WestLB facility, but no later 
than Nov.12 currently.  In any case, ESA must give ENA notice no later than 
our required notice date and doesn't have to, at this point, provide money 
and purchase the equipment 5 days thereafter.  Just explaining the deal so 
you know what leeway there is for negotiating the purchase date.

1.D. - Conflicts with language in 7.  I thought the arrangement was that as 
soon as ESA purchased the equipment from ENA, new purchase contracts drafted 
to take ENA out of the agent loop for those assets.  In ESA's deal, they will 
be the Agent of the equipment on behalf  of the SPV/Owner.

2.A & B. - The GE Change Order and ABB Change Order as defined don't describe 
the actual turbines and transformers, do they?  I thought the Change Orders 
were for ancillary equipment.

3.A.2. - To clarify, add "paid to ABB" after "option premiums".

3.B.3. - Insert a "." at end of section.

4. - Delete.  This is not an option for ESA any longer.

7. - See 1.D. above.

Regards, Lisa

See attached for our changes.  I am typing the Annex IV stuff now  - it has 
to do with Sections 26.4 and 26.5 - resolution of certain Purchaser-Agent 
Disputes.  We also will need to put in the currently-being-negotiated 
assignment language, so the bank knows that they have access to their 
collateral.


Barnas said he was drafting that after the last version Kay drafted.  I have 
not seen it yet.

Attached please find a clean copy of the most recent version of the City
of Austin Agreement (the second document below), as well as a blackline
showing changes from the last version circulated on December 14.  The
Agreement deletes references to specific performance guarantees for
combined cycle plants. The Agreement now has the exhibits rolled in. To
complete the agreement, we need to include the date of execution, the
addresses and contacts for Sections 25.1 and 25.3, and Exhibit H-2. Let
me know if you would like me to e-mail a copy of this directly to Lee
Johnson and Kent Shoemaker.

 Please call when you have the opportunity to discuss the form
agreement you asked me to create.

Subject: Re: LM6K Change Order #2  

I suggest the changes as shown on the attached.  

Chris is researching a drawing number so that we have them committed to a 
certain specification.



I've added the concept of a date certain for the delivery.  I'm referring to 
these as "Equipment" and part of the "Units" so it is clear that the 
warranties apply.

Is there any change to the sound guaranty level (or other guarantees) for the 
units utilizing these stacks?

Attached are files incorporating suggested revisions for the change order to 
Contract 24-LM6K-2-99 for the purchase of a generator step-up transformer for 
the Pleasanton Project.

In lieu of the Exhibit A of the draft you sent out, I have substituted 
Exhibit A, the GE proposal dated October 9, 2000.

I have substituted Exhibit B, GE's standard specifications for generator 
step-up transformers, for the EE&CC specifications in the earlier draft. GE's 
proposal is quoted on the basis of their standard GSU transformer 
specification. I have this only in hard copy and have a call into GE to 
verify this is the applicable standard and whether it is available in 
electronic form. I will give you a copy, Dale.

The two additional documents were transmitted along with GE's proposal and I 
have referenced them in Part I, Paragraph 2.

A redraft of Change Order #5 to the LM 6000 contract to provide for the 
purchase of a GE transformer for the Pleasanton project is attached.  

Please note that I have added some guaranty/LD provisions in Exhibit A, and 
confirm whether these are appropriate in scope and amount.

We will attach the documents included here as separate files as Exhibits B 
and C.  I understand that GE is to provide a more current copy of their 
standard specifications for the transformer to be included in the Exhibits.


Kathleen:  Kay tells me that you are the keeper of change orders.  
Congratulations!!  The discussion of current amount balances, etc. in the 
attached are clearly wrong if we are up to CO#5--it was all based on this 
being the third CO.  Can you please let me know what the right numbers should 
be?

Thanks in advance for your input.  I understand there is some urgency with 
getting this out.

Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) "WestLB" should be changed to "Purchaser"
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not 
"Purchaser's"
2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:



I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay

This is the GE "break-out" contract.  I do not know Brett's timing on signing 
it.   The contract does not contain the "financing specific" indemnification 
provisions, etc.  Those will be found in the "Override Letter" which will 
stay in place as long as the turbine contract is in the financing structure.  
Once the turbines are out of this structure - for instance, if the CAA 
lenders are taken out by project lenders - the "Override Letter" will no 
longer be in effect and the general, more vanilla ts and  cs will apply.

I will send you the latest copy of the "override letter" also.

Eric-

I revised the contract you sent me to make it site specific.  Those changes 
are redlined.  Please note that I have reinserted sections 10.4.1 and 10.4.3 
as well as the defined terms that go with them.  These were related to 
exhaust temperature and energy.  I know this is a simple cycle plant and they 
typically aren't required, but I wanted to see if GE would guarantee it 
anyway.  It maybe helpful in the future if Austin Energy goes combined 
cycle.  If for some reason GE's lawyers specifically want to leave that out, 
then they will probably also want to delete sections 10.4.2 and 10.4.4 (and 
their defined terms) since those also talk about specific exhaust 
guarantees.  Let me know what they decide.

Exhibit A (site basis conditions) which I also revised was not attached to 
your file.  (It's right behind the sign-off pages in my hard copy.)  I 
therefor hand marked up a copy and scanned it.  It is now attached as a 
separate word file. 

Exhibit F is "boiler plate" and shouldn't change.  Exhibit "U" is not in my 
hard copy.  My copy only goes up to Exhibit "T."   If you get something from 
GE on Exhibit "U", send it to me and I will be glad to review it.  

If you have questions, give me a call.  (67550)  I will be in Ausitn 
Wednesday and Thursday, but will be available by cell phone (713) 412-6873.

Thanks,
Eric Booth

Your changes to the letter look fine to me.

go with this one?



We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.  I believe GE prepared #4.   Could 
you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently deleted 
from my computer. Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.

Kay,

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

Thanks,

Lee

Subject:  Enron Contract Verbage

Security Level:?         Internal

Mike,
     When  we  spoke  this morning, Dave advised that one change to the 
language
that  will  be  required is  the addition of the words in red , in bold added 
by
ABB at the end of this paragraph in section 22.2 of the contract.

     In  the  case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or 
(vii)
(other  than   Enron  Engineering  &  Construction  or  NEPCO),  Seller shall 
be
entitled  to  request  and  receive  an  appropriate guaranty, letter of 
credit,
payment  bond  or  other  reasonable  form of payment security, in amount not 
to
exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time of 
the
assignment,  unless  the  assignor  agrees  to  remain  liable  for  all  
future
liabilities  under  this  Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, 
or
payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to be 
an
appropriate  form  of  security  for  the purpose of this provision , so long 
as
payment  in  full  has  been  made  in accordance with the schedule set forth 
in
Article VI.

     Additional commentary may come later today when Dave reaches his first 
stop
on his flight back to Raliegh.

Good morning,

We have made some revisions to the consent agreement.  I did not redline the 
changes since we were looking at  two different documents yesterday.

We added language concerning material adverse event and the need for the 
financing to occur before the consent is effective.  We could not include 
Paul's request concerning compelling the Owner to take action.

Please call me (713 345 7566) or Rose (713 345 7726) with questions, or we 
can address it in our 130 CST phone call.

Thanks,

Kay

Your e-mail is the first I had seen of the override letter.  Attached is
the blackline you requested showing changes from the original West
LB/ABB Agreement to the final form agreement.  Can we set up a time
early tomorrow to discuss this (or late tonight)?  I have a conference
call in 2 minutes  that will probably last a couple of hours.  Please
leave a voice mail letting me know when you want to discuss the ABB
override letter.

the Enron South America Break-Out Agreement.  The only changes made to
this version is the addition of today's date and the 72/25 split of
Change Order 3 in Section 6.2.  We are still missing the Agreement
Reference in section 6.7.1.  We haven't made any changes to the exhibits
since the last time they were circulated.  I will pull them out of our
Houston database and circulate them shortly.

Kay,

Just a couple minor edits.  One, this amendment only covers 4 Standard Base
Exhaust Stacks, so to reference the dwgs for the Heavy Base Exhaust Stacks
and Extensions isn't necessary and could be confusing to somebody "down the
road".

The other adds the October 31, 2000 delivery date for the stacks.

How's the other Amendment related to Brazil?  John Ayres told me yesterday
that he found it hung-up waiting on instruction and permission slip.  Now,
it's supposedly unstuck, with Kathy Clark.  Can you cut it loose?

Also, we have another Amendment in the works to add a Step-up Transformer
for ENA - West, Pleasanton, CA.  I believe Sharon Tweed has this one in the
works per the Portland gang.

Not sure where you and Kent stand on the review of the LV Expansion Facility
Agreement.

Maybe we can visit by phone on Monday?

Lee
