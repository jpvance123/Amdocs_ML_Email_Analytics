This piece from Deutsche Bank is good macro overview of electricity supply /

discussion on NERC (North American Electric Reliability Council Regions), 
beginning on page 15.

Clayton,

It translates into a credit risk for those on the other side of the hedge.
Many producers have a long history of poor timing of hedges.
I could give you quite a long list. They definitely need a bright
adviser who will tell them the price of gas two years from now.

Here's an amazing factoid in today's paper related to the issue of how much 
money you can "make" (sic) by hedging:

...

Other companies analysts say are saddled with hedges include El Paso Energy 
Corp. and Coastal Corp., which are merging. 

A Coastal official declined to comment on the company's forward positions. 

Although El Paso is known for its pipeline business, it produces gas as 
result of its $6.2 billion acquisition last year of Sonat. "More than 90 
percent" of that gas is hedged through the rest of the year, said Bruce 
Connery, vice president of investor relations. The forward contracts are for 
$2.40, he said. 

Hedging in the current market plays to the company's primary aim of meeting 
investors' expectations, Connery said. 

"Our first goal is to deliver the earnings goal that we set out, and that 
dictates that we hedge out commodity volatility," he said. 


...

$2.40??? Are you kidding????

Brad,

Here are my thoughts on your concerns.

* You needs curve inputs.  This is an IT job.  I can help you for the curves 
before the system is properly set up.

* Intrinsic value vs Time value: 
  The intrinsic value depends on how you allocate the volumes.  If you have a 
rough idea about the allocation as
  you did in the spreadsheet, we can calucate the intrinsic value within the 
model.    The difference between the 
  total and the intrinsic will be the (option) time value. However, by 
pre-allocating volumes, you killed some options.
  
  In the storage model, volumes are allocated dynamically, therefore it is 
hard to distinguish the intrinsic vs. time value. 

* Factor of loading:  Factor of loadings are used to give historical 
correlation matrix. The three factors correspond to
  paralle shift, slopping and curveture.  The covariance matrix in the model 
is expressed in the form
     
  COVAR = row( vol_{i} ) *( Correl(i,j) )* Colum( vol_{j} ) where vols are 
the implied volatilities from the vol curve.
  
  (Correl (i,j)) =L*L' +residue (small)
  
where L is the factor of loading matrix.  So in a simple words, the factor of 
loadings (say, 60x3) are a simplier way for us to 
remember the historical correlation matrix (say, 60x60).

Let me know if I can offer further help.

Subject: Storage Model: Simple Issues

Zimin:
 Thanks for your time with the revised storage valuation.  Your right to 
point out the similarity to market bids.  Here are some basic questions tied 
to implementation and calibration:

Model Infrastructure/IT Support: I obviously need to re-build my link to the 
forward curves as the model is not working in my new location.  Short-term 
(aprox 1 month), I'd like to establish a link to the ENA database EGSPROD32 
in order to fetch the long-dated price and volatility curves.  My link to ENA 
forward curves would then be quickly severed in favor of the curves generated 
by the new Bridgeline entity (database name and data structure yet to be 
defined).  However, its not clear to me what is required in this two stage 
process to support your model.  Any definition of model input or minimum 
support requirements you provide is appreciated.  I'll then work with Sandra 
Henderson, an Enron employee providing our IT support, to ensure the model 
continues to work regardless any downstream system changes that may take 
place as we build and establish our separate trading systems or databases.  
Meanwhile, is there anything you think you can do to ensure Im up and running 
quickly?

SANDRA: linking EXCEL spreadsheets to Bridgeline forward curves will be key 
to all our pricing projects, not just the storage model supplied by Research.

Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Value: it would be helpful to decompose the model's 
calculated storage price and to distinguish intrinsic vs extrinsic (time or 
option) value.  I could easily link a new spreadsheet tab to your model 
inputs and to calculate the intrinsic value,  and then through a simple 
difference I could  determine the extrinsic value.  Ive included a simple 
spreadsheet calculation for the intrinsic value for review.  I wanted to 
share this with you to ask the following:
does the nature of the model define intrinsic and extrinsic value differently 
than the simple difference proposed?
do you think it would make sense to do the simple value decomposition in the 
backcode C-code via .dll in order to ensure run-time is faster?



My goal here is straightforward: a) to better understand the model and its 
sensitivities.; and b) to determine if and when the option approach is 
associating significant value above and beyond the simple present value of 
the time spreads.  

Factor Loadings: What are some of the thoughts or insights you can offer with 
regards to factor loadings and how I should interpret the graph of the 3 
factors calculated?  Factor loadings have always been a mystery to me.  For 
example, what problems should I be looking for as a warning against 
mispricing?  What, if anything, is implied about 1 day price change or 
expected curve re-shapings (after all, curve-reshapings are key to storage 
valuation!!!)?

Calibration: we are preparing a simple summary of descriptive statistics 
which should allow me to refine some of the model inputs.  I'll share the 
data when we are and model results once Im up and running.

I would be very willing to make a presentation to you.  This coming Thursday 
unfortunately, I have a sick day scheduled (babies will do this kind of thing 
to you) and will not come into the office.

Would it be more practical to make the presentation to a select group of a 
few (possibly) interested individuals?  This might give us more shceduling 
flexibility and would also seem more appropriate, knowing that what I have is 
a set of suggestions for development and no earth-shuttering, live product.

Please let me know if this accomodates your needs,

Yannis,

 Shirley will know the room in which the lunch is scheduled. Let her know 
what audio-visual materials you'll need. Keep in mind that the research group 
is now about 40 people, some of whom will be watching the presentation on 
video from Portland and from London. The best platform would be to get a 
PC-video or PC-screen link-up, so that everyone, including people watching 
remotely, can see your computer's monitor on a big screen.

 The itinerary for the lunch is that we meet at 11:30 and eat lunch and trade 
news for the first 30-45 minutes, and then at 12:00 or 12:30 at the latest, 
we have a presentation. We try to wrap up by 1:00, so that what we discussed 
yesterday should make for a very good presentation in pretty much every way. 
>From my experience, the audio-visual people need at least an hour advance 
warning to get the screens linked up. Let me know if you need any help in 
getting you and Jenny the things you need.

Dear all,

I followed up on the suggestions at the conference call as follows:-

1) USE LESS DATA

Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less 
robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using 
less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from 
long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed 
by eliminating the first 12 months of data.

2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE

Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6 
months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so 
my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:

PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant

3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE

To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a 
sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result 
was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The 
magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had 
more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those 
peaks and humps adequately.



CONCLUSION

I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15] 
and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is 
plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is 
depicted in blue. 

The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is 
significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is 
considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients, which results in us 
having more confidence in our monthly P&L.


Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate 
study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.

Regards,

Anjam

Subject: Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book

Dear all,

We thought it might be useful to incorporate Brent crude as an explanatory 
variable for PPI; it was found that deviations of Dated Brent Crude from the 
long-term average of $18.80 was the best form of the variable to use (for 
predictions the Brent forward curve produced by the Global Products Group is 
used).  The three new equations developed were:-

PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + c.(DatedBrentCrude - 18.8) + constant, 
where N is 14,15 or 16
[REDDISH CURVES]
r-squared approx 0.49
F-stat approx 32

The chart below shows what our projected PLLU curve would be given this 
equation, and also the three best relations from before which were based upon 
current and future RPI:

PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + constant, where N is 14,15 or 16
[GREENISH CURVES]
r-squared approx 0.47
F-stat approx 45

COMPARISON OF MODELS
As you can see, the two equations differ in the very short-term and very 
long-term; the inclusion of deviations of Brent Crude leads to short-term 
predictions of 3.0% to 3.2% over the next six months.  The greenish curves 
predict PLLU in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% over the next six months.

The curves are then very similar until 2009, when the models including crude 
break-away to the upside, relative to the falling RPI curve.  The model based 
purely on RPI hugs the RPI curve much more closely in the longer term.  This 
is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 
(which we don't).

SUGGESTION
What could be useful now is a differently-specified model designed to 
forecast only the next 3 months, using auto-regressive or auto-regressive 
error terms.  This model would be far more accurate in the near-term, and we 
could include this information onto the front of this long-term model.  This 
may be useful, despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time 
buckets.



BACK-TESTING

All the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data 
sample used (based mainly on 1990s "new paradigm" economy).



Hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele-conference; 
your ideas on this would be appreciated.

Regards,

Anjam

Pavel, Many thanks for your note.

I understand that Digitals are not core Enron business but as you know, I'm 
trying to explore Digitals to give, for example, a company a guaranteed 
income in year one (to mop up expiring tax losses). This  is offset by a 
guaranteed expense in year two. See attached hypothetical example. The 
digital will reflect an underlying commodity to which a company is exposed to 
and would be part of a price risk management strategy, thereby giving it 
'commercial purpose'. 

I would be interested in hearing from you generally on the subject --  the 
rational for using Digitals and  your knowledge of its use in other markets 
(electricity or other commoodity or in the banking sector).

It seems to me that setting the srike is key and a 'value judgement' or am I 
wrong, and are there curves and models which could help you substantiate 
this? In any event, do you have a feel for what an acceptable % of chance or 
likelihood that a commodity price hits the strike on a digital before it 
becomes non arm's length and does not pass the smell test?

Vince, Jarek suggested that you may be able to assist. Your views would also 
be appreciated.

Gillian.

Subject: digitals

Digital options are extremely uncommon in the crude oil market. Nobody ever 
asked me to show quotes in the OTC market. The only time we encountered them 
was when producers, brought by our marketing team, wanted to sell a 
knock-outable swap, whereby they would get a higher swap price in exchange 
for cancelling the swap if the price settled below a certain level. This 
structure had a digital put embedded in it, although the customers didn't 
necessarilly know that. The companies were US oil and gas producers: Venoco, 
Titan, Magnum Hunter, Patiena Oil & Gas, Belco, Central Resources. It was 
about 1 year ago. In the OTC market, at about the same time, I asked for 
quotes to hedge these transactions and sold a digital Cal 00 $16 swaption to 
Elf and strips of digital puts to somebody else that I cannot recall.

I hope this helps.

Pavel

FYI (BM = balancing market in his email).

I'm still on Eklavya's back to produce a white paper analysis of possible 
trading stretagies under NETA and their likely implications for prices and 
volatilities.  I'll forward it on as soon as (if ever) I receive it.

Subject: Gaming of NETA Prices - Constraints on The McCoy Strategy

I believe most people are now familiar with the McCoy strategy for 
manipulating imbalance prices in a favourable direction:

1) Take a massive long or short position in forward trading

2) Choose physical production decisions to drive system 
 i) long if forward market postion is long
 ii) short if forward market postion is short

3) If system is long it needs to accept bids, if system is short it needs to 
accept offers

4) If forward market postion is long submit very large postive bids to the BM 
to drive SSP high - SSP is price received for spilling power to the BM (going 
into BM long)

5) If forward market postion is short submit very small (even negative) 
offers to the BM to drive SBP low - SBP is price paid for purchasing power 
from BM (going into BM short) 

The NETA programme intends to tag transmission cosntraint related trades in 
the BM. According to DISG 24 "Tagging Constraint Trades" (21 Dec 99) Option 
3(a) [the option that is proposed to be adopted], paragraph 2.3 (p.4):

"In the relevant Settlement Period, all accepted Offers and Bids volumes that 
can be arbitraged, i.e. where a volume has been bid higher than the price at 
which a volume has been offered, are eliminated;"

One of the implications of the above procedure is that the highest bids (the 
McCoy bids) and the lowest offers (the McCoy offers) are likely to be 
eliminated from the calculation of imbalance prices. This will make it harder 
to pursue the McCoy strategy successfully.

Thoughts and comments welcome.

Thanks,

Eklavya.

Vince-

1. We can detect "hoarding" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against 
the actual inflow.

2. We can detect "market power" by dissociating the seller from the buyer, 
distinguishing between the physical "cost" in gas to run the generators and 
the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.

3. (As you noted) We can detect "storage" as the difference between inflow 
and consumption.

It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model 
of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market 
prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing 
capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas 
prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for 
the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors: 
hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can "calibrate" the 
price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price 
elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding, 
from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis 
trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage 
and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and 
each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally, 
flows are "explained" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if 
necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of 
the weather.

I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a 
model.

Dear all,

I completeley agree with Ben that Treasuries are the most liquid and reliable 
benchmarks. I also think that FMAs have their own advantages and 
disadvantages.

However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBOR 
as benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (for 
example, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different from 
that on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.

As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, use 
anything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value products 
significantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR for 
everything priced on Capital Markets .

 We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity, 
recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.

To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities) 
we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).

Let us continue our discussion on this.

Slava

Subject: Choosing the Riskfree Rate

Dear all,

Following on from the discussions had with Vince et al a few weeks ago, 
regarding the problems inherent in using Treasuries as our benchmark riskfree 
curve, I've written the attached short document. My preliminary conclusions 
are as follows:

Recent turmoil in the Treasury market mostly hit 10 and 30-year bonds.
Treasuries are still the most liquid curve, and that used by banks for 
benchmarking risky debt.
There is a considerable a liquidity/scarcity premium inherent within the 
corporate-Treasury spread, which we are not taking into account. More 
accurate measurement of this premium should allow us to calculate bankruptcy 
prices based on Treasuries, which are consistent with the market.

All further comments are welcome of course.

Regards

Ben

   CORNEY & BARROW, the mainly City wine bar chain, is going into the
derivatives market. The chain is thought to be the first in the
hospitality industry to take a position against our atrocious
weather.

   Sarah Heward, the managing director, got the idea after meeting a
bunch of customers who had just left Garban to set up their own
business, Speedwell Weather Derivatives. About half her wine bars
have outside terraces which have understandably not proven too
popular of late.
   "They set me up with a hedge - my counterparty is Enron US," says
Heward. This safeguards a modest Pounds 15,000 of turnover.

Andy,

The scale effect in the transport model can be explained. 

I use a European option to do the illustration.

I raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount, use the fuel 
percentage to adjust the strike.
The net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up.

If the fuel percentage is not very high, the option premium actually 
increases with the level, although the
intrinsic value decreases.  

If the fuel percentage is very high (>8%), then we see a decreasing option 
price.

In the transport deal, fuel change is often below 5%, so you will not see a 
decreasing spread option price
when NYMEX moves up.  So I think the transport model still does what it 
should do.


Zimin


In the following exmaple, I used r=6%, vol=20%, T=100days, see spreadsheet 
for details.

Andy,

The following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport 
valuation.

I add an "NYMEX add-on" to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel
adjustment, keep everything else the same.  The transport value (PV of the 
spread options) 
increases when NYMEX add-on increases.  

I can visit you at your desk if you have further question.

The AGA weekly change for the week ending on 7/7 is at 68.
The model predicted 66 for 6/30, it came out at 69.

The following graph depicts the past performance.



Mike, 

Where can I get the temperature data ?  I believe the model can be further 
improved by incorporating some
explanatory variables like temperature.

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis
the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in
power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this
regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the
Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for
Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of
forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be
interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be
interested in receiving this preprint.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

Valery Kholodnyi

PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for
spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:

and
Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00,

2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000.
3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000.
4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at

Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint
TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000.
5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.

As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard
approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a
stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of
spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian
process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is
Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit
valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that
the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the
absence of spikes.

Vince,

As a followup to our meeting with David Port and Rudi Zipter re Enron's 
investment in SK-Enron, Maureen and I wrote the attached position paper on 
the Japanese Yen.  As we have discussed, the volatility of the won closely 
tracks fluctuation in the yen, and this yen position paper is intended to 
complement the won outlook piece for a broader perspective on currencies that 
takes into account the yen's influence on asian currencies. .  

We would like to distribute this outlook to David and Rudi, but wanted to 
send it to you for initial reaction prior to internal distribution.

Thank you, and let me know if you have any questions or comments re the 
attached.

Gwyn

Vince:

I'd like to send you some articles on the fleet card business.

If you have some time, I'd like to discuss the meeting that we had with 
Comdata (which has a 60% market share of the fleet card business).  They have 
some live data that potentially could be very interesting; however, I'd like 
to discuss it with you.

Truckers still waiting for signs of pent-up freight demand; earnings 
shortfalls, layoffs loom 
If you are waiting for trucking to kick-start the nation's economic recovery, 
pull up a chair and wait awhile. Trucking CEOs say they haven't seen this 
slow a first quarter in a decade. 
"Perhaps the weakest first quarter for freight demand since Swift became a 
public company in 1990," Phoenix-based Swift Transportation Chairman and CEO 
Jerry Moyes said. 
The first-quarter trucking mantra historically has been this: everybody loses 
money in January, hopes for a break-even February and earns whatever profit 
there is in the quarter in March. That formula may not hold this year. 
Gregory L. Quesnel, president and CEO of Con-Way Transportation Services and 
Emery Worldwide parent CNF Inc., said the current slowdown was first detected 
late in the third quarter last year and has become "more pronounced in each 
successive quarter." March, he said, has been "as disappointing as the first 
two months this year." 
Layoffs already are occurring at the major LTL carriers. Yellow Freight 
System has idled as many as 1,000 Teamsters and hundreds of white-collar 
back-office workers. Most large carriers are warning of profit shortfalls 
that will cause them to miss analysts' first-quarter estimates. But there are 
deeper fears, too. Marginal players may be forced into bankruptcy. Small, 
family-owned carriers may be unable to exit the industry on their own terms 
because of the shocking decline in the value of used trucks that is causing 
some companies to be valued at less than half their worth of just two years 
ago. 
Swift's volume drop-off began with shipments originating on the West Coast in 
January and February and it is continuing in March, Moyes said. Coupled with 
reduced demand from the Southwest, Moyes said Swift will not meet analysts' 
first-quarter earnings expectations. Swift is not alone. 
"We hauled less freight in February than February a year ago," said Bob 
Hammel, executive vice president of Pittsburgh-based Pitt Ohio Express, a 
leading privately held Eastern regional LTL carrier. "The slowdown in 
manufacturing began in the middle of last year and it was precipitous. Nobody 
anticipated the speed in which manufacturing demand fell off." 
Even Con-Way, the most profitable LTL operation in the past five years, said 
it would have a decline in first-quarter operating income compared with the 
year-ago period. Con-Way's tonnage declines were estimated in the 
"mid-single-digit" percentage range. 
Roadway Express estimated that its current tonnage levels are running 10 to 
11 percent below those a year ago, which will result in an approximately 
one-half of 1 percent (0.5 percent) decline in its operating ratio. (see 
sidebar) 
Pat Hanley, Overnite Transportation's senior vice president and chief 
financial officer, said freight figures were flat in February year over year 
but rose slightly in March. Overnite is the exception to the LTL industry 
with as many as 24 new terminals scheduled to be opened this year. 
"January was pretty good to us, but February was flat. It's coming back in 
March. We're probably up in low single digits, 3 to 4 percent. We're picking 
back up. The economy has hurt us. If you had asked us at the start of the 
year, we'd have said we'd be up double-digits," Hanley said. 
The national economic picture is "a big concern," Hanley said. "We're not 
seeing pressure on prices, at least not so far. We're seeing customers ship 
10 pallets a day instead of 20. The shipment size is coming down. Certainly 
we're concerned. We'll do O.K., but not as great as we'd like." 
Forget consumer confidence surveys or the producer pricing index or whatever 
stars align in Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's world. The 
genuine leading indicator of any national economic trend is trucking, which 
is always a first-in, first-out industry in any economic slowdown. 
To hear trucking industry leaders tell it, get comfortable with beans and 
franks for dinner. It's going to be awhile before it's filet mignon time 
again. 
Shippers see what's happening as well but say it's still too early in the 
year for carriers to start cutting rates to fill empty trucks. 
"All the carriers we talk with report flat or slightly declining business 
levels -- definitely slower than early last year," said Bill Huie, assistant 
vice president of corporate transportation for NCH Corp., Irving, Texas. 
"With a couple of exceptions, carriers we talk with have no plans for 
expansion in the next few months. We are getting feelers about some possible 
lane adjustments to boost revenue. But generally it appears a little early in 
the economic downturn for much price movement." 
The national LTL carriers are seeing the same things. "Our business is down 
pretty substantially for the first quarter," said Roger Dick, spokesman for 
Yellow Corp., parent of Yellow Freight System and two large regional LTL 
carriers, Jevic Transportation, Delanco, N.J., and Saia Motor Freight, 
Duluth, Ga. 
USFreightways Corp., citing what it called the nation's "serious economic 
slowdown," said it expects first-quarter earnings to fall "very substantially 
below" current Wall Street consensus. 
Extreme weather conditions also contributed to the already weakened operating 
environment, USF Chairman, President and CEO Samuel K. Skinner added. 
"Traditionally, the first quarter builds momentum slowly, with March being 
the strongest month of the period," Skinner said in a statement. "This year, 
the economic slowdown of the fourth quarter of 2000 accelerated in January 
and February, softening even the normal modest expectations for those two 
months." 
It's not just the LTL industry that's hurting. The Morgan Stanley Dean Witter 
truckload freight index continues to show the worst demand-supply 
relationship since analyst James J. Valentine began tracking the data in 
April 1994. Two events can cause weakness in the index, according to 
Valentine. They are either an abundance of excess trucks on the road or weak 
freight demand. 
"So far in 2001, we have seen the confluence of both factors, but the 
fall-off in demand has far outpaced the increase in supply," Valentine wrote 
in his most recent "Trucking Snapshot" for early March. 
Year-to-date measurement for truckload demand is down 25 percent year over 
year, according to Valentine's index, while supply is up only 7 percent. That 
would indicate the over capacity was a significant issue last year but was 
"masked by the strong economy," Valentine says. 
In a more ominous note, Valentine believes overcapacity will continue to 
plague the truckload industry for the next one to two years. Only a 
reaccelerating national economy can bring the demand-supply back in balance 
for the truckload sector in the near term, Valentine predicts. 
The overproduction of new Class 8 trucks from early 1998 through early last 
year has put too many trucks on the roads and caused supply to back up at 
manufacturers, wholesalers and other retailers. Used trucks have lost on 
average more than 30 percent of their value over the past 18 months. 
Anecdotally, one used truck dealer, Music City Truck & Equipment, in 
LaVergne, Tenn., is holding a "two-for-one" sale on three- to five-year-old 
Class 8 Freightliners. You can buy two for around $30,000, less than a brand 
new Chevy Suburban SUV. 
What that means is a trucker who bought a 1998 Class 8 truck for $70,000 and 
depreciated half the value over three years has a piece of equipment on the 
books this year at $35,000. But assuming it has lost 30 percent of that 
value, it may only be worth $24,500 in actuality. For a carrier with a 
100-truck fleet, that equates to a loss of more than $1 million on assets. 
The glut may last for a while, according to Valentine's analysis. Assuming a 
three-year trade-in cycle, most of the Class 8 tractors in the truckload 
sector are just now rolling over to the used-truck market. That means that 
overcapacity will plague the truckload industry for at least the next year. 
That will result in some of the marginal carriers exiting the business, as 
did nearly 1,900 carriers last year that either closed or declared 
bankruptcy. 
"We can see from indexes, surveys and other information available to us that 
it is unlikely there will be any significant improvement in March and freight 
demands will continue to be soft throughout the month. Based on all of these 
factors, we expect USFreightways' profits for the first quarter to be very 
substantially less than published analysts' forecasts," Skinner said. 
In addition, severe weather conditions including an earthquake in Seattle, 
rainstorms in California and blizzards in the Northeast have added cost and 
decreased efficiencies, Skinner added. 
Expectations at each of USF's operating companies have been affected, some 
more than others. The LTL, logistics, reverse logistics and 
freight-forwarding units are all showing decreased revenue and volume over a 
similar period last year, Skinner said. 
Further job cuts at USF Worldwide, its freight forwarder, would be in the 
offing as cost controls at the unit would be "accelerated" in the wake of the 
softening economy, Skinner said. Late last year, Skinner said the rebuilding 
process at USF Worldwide would be a two-year process. But the worsening 
economy has made that rebuilding job harder, he said. 
"We are seeing evidence that the slowing economy is, in fact, further 
impeding progress in this area," Skinner said. "During the fourth quarter of 
2000 and continuing into the first quarter of 2001, the company has taken 
steps to increase cost efficiencies. Among these actions are a substantial 
cutback in capital spending and significant reductions in the labor force. 
These cost-control efforts will be accelerated to partially counterbalance 
the damaging impact of the current economic and weather conditions." 
In the 2000 first quarter, USF posted $22.3 million net income, a 27 percent 
rise from the $17.5 million earnings in the 1999 first quarter. At the time, 
that was USF's 15th straight quarter-over-quarter earnings increase. It came 
on $608.2 million revenue, an 18.5 percent rise in from the $513.2 million 
revenue in the 1999 first quarter. Analysts had been estimating USF to earn 
about $3.50 a share earnings for 2001, compared with actual $3.61 earnings 
per share for all of last year. In the fourth quarter last year, USF earned 
$23.7 million, or 91 cents a share.

                   greater exposure to fuel than LTL carriers.
WTI oil            Negative for all carriers, as $25 per

Vince-

Here is the basic idea I was alluding to:

Suppose a car dealer promised to "match any advertised price." Then his 
competitor would feel the need to respond in kind. And so on, until all 
dealers advertised they would "match any advertised price." Now, consider one 
of these dealer's decision to perhaps lower his prices. If he does so, 
everyone will immediately match his price, so his market share will remain 
unchanged, at whatever it was before, but his revenues (and all other dealers 
as well) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction. So, the 
dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars.

Now, suppose a limited partnership, where the partners contract to "control" 
who they are in business with, by putting a "right of first refusal" clause 
into the partnership's papers, whereby any partner wishing to sell his 
interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the 
partner received from outside for his shares. Now, suppose you are an 
outsider, considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want 
to buy into the partnership. You know if your offer is a "good" one from your 
perspective, offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return, the 
existing partners will match it, and you will get nothing in the deal but you 
will have paid, from your own pocket, for your due diligence. Conversely, if 
you offer too much for the shares, then the other partners will not match 
your offer and you will then realize you overpaid. In neither case can you 
credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current 
partners. So, you (basically) don't make an offer.  So, a partner's shares 
are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers 
he receives for them. The "right of first refusal" clause precludes 
economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares 
(essentially) illiquid.

Vince, Zimin,
I participated in a telephone conference on this company this morning.  There 
was a possibility Enron would invest in it.

Their product appears to be a GUI interface over the top of ILOG Solver (and 
possibly ILOG CPLEX) which allows problems to be expressed in high level 
terms.  I do not see any immediate application at Enron, but I am interested 
in the concepts used so expressed an interest in a demo.  Maybe it would be 
useful for general modelling projects here.

They do not even have a user manual for their software, so it will be 
difficult to figure out what it does unless a demo is arranged.  The 
possibility for growth in the company seems small as the ILOG software is a 
modest size market and their product is aimed at only a small part of that 
market.  I think the scheduling tools in SAP, i2, etc are more likely to 
succeed than this one as they are already integrated into an information 
system.

Because of the small market for this software, the many competitors, the 
absence of any clear use for it at Enron and the early stage of development, 
there is very little prospect of us funding this company.

Tom

Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey

Vince,

John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and 
potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with 
in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which 
is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which 
discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to 
value these options

First, some additional information.

Option characteristics:
-- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company)
-- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated
-- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or 
Turkish Lire)

We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75 
per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on 
December 15, 2000.  The company's investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds) 
are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 
$118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due 
to such a large "valuation gap", they originally encouraged us to exercise 
all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early 
Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to "swap" instrinsic value for time value by 
repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.

We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to 
use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most 
appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company's 
historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use 
(although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)

A few key points:
-- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this "to 
be negotiated" discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future 
options intrinsic value in 3 years
 (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but 
the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation)
-- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we 
have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return
-- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount
-- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we 
obviously do not exercise.

We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able 
to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and 
the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach 
our difficulty:  since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market 
and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing 
that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the 
non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option 
volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel 
RAC's approach is double counting.

If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  I'll give you a 
call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information.

Regards,
John Bottomley

Review of energy policies kicks off




Asahi Shimbun 

April 25, 2000 

A government advisory panel on Monday embarked on a
comprehensive review of energy-related policies. 

``We want to come up with feasible policies and at the
same time clearly present reasons for those policies,''
Yoichi Kaya, a professor emeritus at the University of
Tokyo, told a meeting of the Coordination Subcommittee
under the Advisory Committee for Energy, an advisory
panel to Minister of International Trade and Industry
Takashi Fukaya. Kaya chairs the subcommittee. 

The nuclear development policy, including the
government's goal for building new nuclear power plants,
is expected to be a focus of the discussions. 

A spate of nuclear accidents have made construction of
plants increasingly difficult, and the nation's power
suppliers have reduced the number of new nuclear power
plants expected to be in operation by fiscal 2010 from 20
to 13. 

The subcommittee, set up for the first time in about 10
years, is made up of about 30 members, and members of
anti-nuclear nongovernmental organizations have been
included for the first time. 

Some members told Monday's meeting that the
government must stop taking the nuclear development
policy for granted and seriously look into the possibility
of introducing renewable energy, such as wind and solar
power. 

Also on the agenda will be energy saving measures. 

Energy consumption in the residential and commercial
sector, made up of homes and offices, and in the
transportation sector, which includes cars and trucks, has
almost doubled over the past 25 years. 

At Monday's meeting, many members stressed the need
to change public consciousness toward the use of
energy. 

MITI plans to present studies on how life would be
affected by compulsory energy saving measures such as
automatically turning off air conditioners at certain
temperatures or vehicle engines when they are idle.

Dear All:


Let us meet early this afternoon. 

Here is the overview of the model:

1)The Ethylene margin collars are priced using Asian Spread option. 
  The forward curve and volatility curve are provided by the desk.
  The correlation between the Ethylene and Ethylene cost starts from the
  historical spot correlation 50% and grows with the maturity.

2) The overall 40MM payout cap is modeled sepereately.

    I fitted the historical spread ( 10 years data ) to a mean reverting model
   with stronger mean reverting strength on the floor side.  The model 
produces
   trajectories that are statistically simular to the historical data. 

  Then the expected payoff is computed through simulation. 

At the meeting we will discuss the assumptions and present the results.


Zimin

Huge Growth in Natural Gas Storage Tracked

     As the natural gas market approaches 30 Tcf per year, demand for natural
gas storage capacity will rise exponentially.  Although the snowball has just
started rolling, current plans by natural storage operators will boost
working capacity by 430 Bcf, or 10%, and will raise peak-day deliverability
11.8 Bcf per day, or 13.8%, according to a new survey by Intelligence Press.
Intelligence Press' new multimedia research package provides a comprehensive
look at all current activity on 458 storage fields with additional key
information on 101 LNG facilities. Among them are 38 proposed natural gas
storage fields and 15 storage expansion projects. Depleted fields capture the
largest share of the proposed fields with 24, followed by aquifers with six,
and salt domes and salt beds with four each. Altogether the proposed new
fields account for about 329 Bcf in working capacity and 9.7 Bcf per day in
deliverability.  Proposed and potential expansions represent an increase of
about 100.5 Bcf of working capacity and 2.1 Bcf per day in deliverability.
But these projects are just the tip of the iceberg. Regulatory changes,
shifting natural gas flows and increases in demand due to growth in the
economy and particularly in natural gas fired power generation are expected
to cause significant additional storage growth in the next decade. For more

		 Subject: Combinatorial Auction

Stinson and Greg,

I have read the paper "Combinatorial Auction with Multiple Winners for 
Universal Service" from Richard Steinberg and Frank Kelly. They propose a 
combinatorial auction which is an auction for multiple items that allows 
bidders to realize their synergies on combinations of items. The 
combinatorial auction is appropriated for bandwidth commodity because most 
bidders in the market have synergies on the combination of items. For 
example, if we want to get bandwidth between Boston and DC, we would bid for 
Boston-NY and NY-DC. It will be valuable to us only if we won both links. If 
we won only one link, it will be useless.

In the paper, they propose the auctioning method but their method has not 
been tested or validated yet. I have not checked their proposition 
mathematically but their paper was published in Management Science so I think 
it should be all right. I will look at it in more details and let you know. 
Anyhow, there are also other combinatorial auctions that are actually used, 
for example, the Alberta government's PPA auction that Enron Canada was 
participated 3-4 months ago.

Based on our long position on bandwidth, Auction and Exchange might be a good 
channel to dispose our unused (or unsold) bandwidth. I know there is not much 
demand in the market. But if we open a combinatorial auction or exchange, we 
might be able to increase our market share. (by taking demand from our 
competitors). I believe, at the moment, there are no bandwidth exchanges that 
allow "combinatorial" bids. If we are the first one to do it, we might 
improve our sale channel and gain some market share. (Note: Auction -> one 
seller and many buyers: Exchange -> many sellers and many buyers.)

Moreover, I think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we 
cannot sell them anyway. In addition, we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in 
the system and bid in the auction. If the current wining bid is too low, we 
can just over-bid it and keep the product. This way, we can indirectly put a 
reserve price on the products.

Let's meet sometime in the first week of January.

An interesting piece of information from the oil markets. 
Iraq is trying to extract concessions from the US and threatens to shut down
production as of Oct 1 (just in time for the US elections).

The source of this info is Phil Verlaeger (an oil analyst).
He is very good but excessively concerned with Iraqi machinations.
He is the source of news (reported by Friedman of the New York Times in
his op-ed columns) about massive Iraqi trading in the
oil futures markets. I personally discount this info: the volume and 
transparency of
the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by 
Saddam's
government. There may be some trading by Iraqi officials on the side.

As you are painfully aware, we had a power outage Wednesday morning in the 
Enron Building.  This outage was caused by localized structural failure of 
the raised floor in our 34th floor Data Center.  This resulted in disruption 
to the power distribution system servicing the phone switch and a number of 
ENA servers.

As a cautionary move, Enron OnLine was interrupted while the extent of the 
failure was assessed, resulting in the system being unavailable from 11:23 to 
11:39.  All Enron Building telephones and voicemail were unavailable for 
approximately one hour and 20 minutes and certain ENA trading systems were 
unavailable for over two hours.  During this time the power was stabilized 
and systems were restored.  Immediate steps are being taken to correct this 
problem. 

We apologize for this inconvenience.

If you have any questions in regard to this outage, please call Philippe Bibi 
at x37698 or Bill Donovan at x35459

Ken and Greg,

The gamma and cross gamma from our spread option appear to be correct. 

One anomaly I found is the price change as function of maturity, see attached 
figure.
It is odd, isn't it ?  And the seeming gamma anomaly is largely because of 
this.

Zimin,

I have been looking at the new transport model and there are some returns in 
the greek calculations that I am not comfortable with.  I have looked through 
the formulas and do not see inconsistencies, but we are getting significantly 
higher Gamma values in 'out years' than in the 'near months/years'.  Rho also 
seems to be very high throughout the curve.  We are prepared to release this 
model to be used on the floor, but would like you to sign off on the 
calculations.  I know that you have a meeting on this on Wednesday, and 
wanted to get you the model to review early.

A good example that I am talking about is on the tab "LongTerm9".  This is 
the Kingsgate to Malin deal that we worked on previously.

Please give me (or Greg Couch) a call with any questions.

Thanks.

Ken

Vince,

I have written a paper, which supposedly is going to be published in the
February 2000 issue of EPRM, probably after some editorial cuts (at least
this is what I am being told by them).  I would appreciate your thoughts if
you would have time to read it.

Shelley,

My colleague, Clayton Vernon, who has a background in  economics, wrote a 
short summary of arguments
against the ROFR. 

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with 
a numerical estimate of the
value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has 
distributional consequences:
he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of 
the value of this option
could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific; 
so we shall rather 
produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.

Subject: auctions with an incumbent's right of first refusal

Vince-

Here is an essay on the issue you are discussing:


The Adverse Economic Impact of "Rights of First Refusal"

An option to "first refuse" to match a competitor's offer is a restraint of 
free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace. This economic 
conclusion is unambiguous.

If an "incumbent" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for 
an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and 
expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower 
than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded 
to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.

In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for 
auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will 
be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the 
full value of the item up for auction.  This is the efficient result in a 
market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources 
freely allocated to the high bidder.  If the auction has open bids, we can 
again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at 
a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the 
highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the 
second-highest valuation.

Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match 
the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must 
justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the 
following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due 
diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the 
top bid from a competitor.

Simply put, the incumbent with a "right of first refusal" can be safely 
predicted to simply match their competitor's bid by "rule of thumb." But the 
incumbent's valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the 
valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and 
administrative expenses.  And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise 
of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial 
financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted 
along with the bid.

Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the "Winner's Curse," a bidder 
realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match 
it, he almost certainly overbid.

Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when 
an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do 
not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may 
just "fire off" a "low-ball" bid.  After all, in almost every conceivable 
"state of the world" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose 
money.  So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a 
below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest

Vince-

I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind.

The "no arbitrage" condition equates trading margins across the country. 
Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is 
almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost 
completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call 
option.

The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing 
gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas 
from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are 
the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for 
transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and 
the valuations of the storage option.

There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork. 
They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short 
time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability 
mentioned above, or point-estimates ("calibrations") using only today's data 
based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with 
the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price 
versus capacity similarly, "competing" for outflows.

I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at your 
earliest convenience.

Clayton

Hi Karolina,

Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time
difference, why don't we plan on tomorrow (Friday) 8:00AM PDT, 4:00PM BDT?  My
number in the states is 503-464-8430.  Give me your number, too, so that I can
call back if I get hung up in a meeting or something.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but
in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout
the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for
the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each
plant's aggregate values are reported.

I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a
Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL
query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making
appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood
documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I
can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine
at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation,
so it may be available now.

Let's talk and maybe we can help you out,
Michael

>>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>> 
Michael, 

I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I am
currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and
consequently the person to contact in case of problems. 

I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide
the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the
numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and
system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each
station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though,
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea
Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations
according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station
Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows: 

For each hour, for each generating station: 

"marginal cost" [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] -
VOM_cost [o/MWh] 

This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a marginal
station which I get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a
station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea Marginal Units query. I
have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and TransArea_Data table but non
of the costs there match my results. 

Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which
outputs I should be using to obtain the right results? 

It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case
could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much. 

Regards 

Karolina

It looks to me like the market for distributed computing will displace heavy 
iron within the next several years.  The structure is still very early in its 
development, but I think there will be commercial opportunities for Enron in 
bandwidth and electricity.  I would be interested to know what issues you two

Vince, 
I ran across this during my recruiting at Vanderbilt.  It is headed by Hans 
Stoll, one of the leading derivative academicians in the country.  I looked 
at their website briefly and thought you might be interested.  I have also 
forwarded some email correspondence between Dr. Stoll and Joe Gordon, one of 
our Associates and a former student of his at Owen School.  We have been very 
successful lately in recruiting at Vanderbilt, both at the undergrad and MBA 
levels, and have gotten some high quality people.  Please let me know if you 
have any interest in this and I would be glad to follow up with Dr. Stoll or 
help out in any way I can.

Thank you,

Joe,

Thanks for your note.

The purpose of the FMRC is to stimulate research on financial markets and to
provide a link between academic research, real world issues and regulation.
Members of the center sit on the advisory board and help direct the research
of the center. They send an unlimited number of participants to center
conferences. Our center is unique in its mix of academics, practitioners and
regulators. For members, such as Enron, it provides a window on the academic
world, and would give Enron an opportunity to stimulate research in the use
of markets in heretofore unusual commodities.

More information on the center can be found at
http://mba.vanderbilt.edu/fmrc/

Center members include, NYSE, Nasdaq, CME, some high tech trading firms,
Merrill Lynch....

Joining the center usually requires a top management decision, but I would
approach it through the research and the trading areas. One way to start is
to see if anyone in a position to recommend joining the center would like to
attend this year's conference on April 13 -14. The program is on the web
site. (Membership is $10,000 per year)

Appreciate your interest and help.

Let me know if we should provide more detail to someone.

Regards,

Hans

Sorry for the delay, but we haven't forgotten about your interest in having
Enron participate in the FMRC.  Our holdup is determining who is the
appropriate contact person at Enron (that, and neglect).  We're not sure if
we should approach someone from trading, research, senior management, etc.
Also, any additional information on the role the participating firms play
would be helpful.

Patrick,

We have those two models in the exotica library.   You need to add Exotica.xll
located in O:\research\exotica\xll to your Excel before you can use the 
functions.
You can find the documentation in  O:\research\exotica\doc.
Example spreadsheets can be found in  O:\Research\Exotica\ExampleSpreadsheets.

The precedure of addin is as follows.
1) Clik Tools/Addin on your Excel
2) Choose Browse and got  to O:\research\exotica\xll
3) Select Exotica.xll or its identical copy Exotica1.xll
4) Answer the question "Copy ..."  No.
5) Click OK, then you should see EXOTICA menu bar pop up.

If you have any more questions please let me know.

 Thanks for responding to Christian. I had replied earlier and said that EVT 
is based on iid events, and is therefore not useful in weather, where there 
is so much correlation going on. Jitendra from AA raised the same issue

Subject: extreme value theory applied to weather

Dear Vince,

Back in July, when you visited our Sydney office you mentioned extreme value 
theory. I am wondering whether research is looking into the application 
of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news 
article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min, 
etc. 

I am in particular referring to the news article below:

http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm

In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for 
t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the
past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in 
particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could 
provide a meaningful tool for the analysis. 

Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has 
a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts 
of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich) 
is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....


Thank you! 


Regards,
Christian

Subject: Intelligence: El Paso Capacity--Someone has Upped the Ante But Match 
Still Possible

Negotiated El Paso Deal Topped

    
     El Paso confirmed that someone had upped the ante on the negotiated deal 
for slightly
     more than 1.2 Bcf/d in firm capacity to the California border that was 
announced Friday
     (see Daily GPI, Dec. 13). A higher bid was submitted prior to 
Wednesday's 1 p.m. MST
     deadline in a four-day open season, a pipeline spokesman said. However, 
the original
     negotiating party has until this afternoon to match the new price and 
retain the capacity. 

     The new bid was for $38 million over one year starting Jan. 1, about $8 
million more than
     the amount in Friday's announcement ($30 million). One source called it 
"ridiculous" that
     someone was willing to pay so much for the space, given that on a 
mark-to-market basis
     the capacity is worth only about $20-25 million. 

     Late last week some sources speculated that Duke Energy was the 
recipient of next
     year's package given its large power generation holdings in California. 
A marketer
     yesterday said he believed Dynegy upped the ante. "Rather than go 
through all the
     hassles they [Dynegy] had at FERC with the 1998-99 package, they let 
someone else do
     all the work this time and then came in late with a higher bid. That way 
no one can
     complain that the procedure was tainted. After all, Dynegy has quite a 
few power plants
     in California to keep fueled, and all of their current FT on El Paso 
expires at the end of
     this year. Of course, they still could be thwarted if the original 
negotiated customer
     matches their bid. It may all sound kind of Machiavellian but sort of 
makes sense." Other
     sources heavily discounted the chances of Dynegy being the new high 
bidder, pointing out
     that the company made significantly less than expected this year because 
San
     Juan/border basis differentials narrowed significantly. A Dynegy source 
indicated that the
     company was involved in the bidding and lost to Duke in the first round. 

     Regardless of what happens next year, a marketer noted that the Southern 
California
     border/San Juan basis spread continues to compress as SoCal Gas 
withdraws from
     storage and east-of-California utilities exercise their peaking 
contracts because of cold
     weather in the Rockies and elsewhere in the West. From a December index 
spread of 29
     cents, the border/basin gap was down to about 18 cents Wednesday, she 
said.

Zhiyang,

Got your message.  

As we discussed, the best way to breakdown the big correlation matrix between 
different location indices is through "cluster analysis".  The idea is to 
select major
hubs and the "satellite" markets.  By establish the correlation between the 
hubs
and correlation between the satellites and the hubs, the big matrix can be 
significantly
reduced.    Then the traders only need to input the correlations between the 
hubs.

This technique has been applied in our Value at Risk system.  You may talk to 
Tanya to find out the details.

Michael,

The science of measuring operational risk is in its early stages of 
development.
There are really no cook-book  solutions. One has to use creativity and a lot
of common sense.

Mr. Kaminsky,

Recently, I read articles published by GARP and monographs in a book 
published by GARP.  Although they are excellent sources of introduction to 
operational risk, none of them have any details on the "how to."

If you know of a good book or book(s) could you recommend one?  

Thank you.

Mark,

After recently reviewing the booking of the P+ options, it is my=20
understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread=
=20
option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are=20
assumed to be correlated Geometric Brownian Motion processes  (i.e. the pri=
ce=20
process assumptions are consistent with standard Black-76 model assumptions=
=20
extended to two commodities). =20

The payoff for a call option is:

Payoff =3D Max( 0,  A =01) B =01) K).

Where:
 A =3D NXWTI (delivery price for Nymex)
 B =3D Posting Price =3D (WTI Swap) =01) (Posting Basis)
 K=3D Posting Bonus (fixed).

The only complication of this option as compared to most other spread optio=
ns=20
is that leg "B" of the spread is a combination of three prices,  the two=20
futures prices which make up the WTI swap for the given month, and the=20
average posting basis during the delivery month.   Combination of these=20
prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "B" and=
=20
the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of=
=20
prices and its correlation with the NXWTI price.  I believe that this=20
approach is more straightforward than the alternative, which would be to us=
e=20
a three or four-commodity model with its associated volatility and=20
correlation matrices.

In summary, I believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of=20
these types of options, assuming that the inputs are set correctly.

SURVEY FINDS PRODUCERS PLAN TO SPEND MORE THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED IN 2000 
   
 06/19/2000 
 Petroleum Finance Week 
 (c) 2000 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 

 Oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and 
production expenditures by more than they anticipated
 at the beginning of the year, Lehman Brothers Inc. found in a mid-year 
update of its annual E&P survey. "The 326 companies
 we surveyed are planning on an 18.2 percent increase, versus a 10.2 percent 
rise budgeted in December," said James D.
 Crandell, who follows oil services and drilling for the New York investment 
banker.

 He emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in Lehman's survey reflects 
increases in budgets for 2000 and not
 underspending of budgets during 1999. "Among the companies that were 
included in our December 1999 and May 2000
 surveys, global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated 
to have been spent during 1999 in December. It
 also indicates that nearly $6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide 
exploration budgets since December," Crandell said.

 The survey's respondents said that they planned to increase U.S. E&P 
expenditures by 17.6 percent, up from 15.9 percent
 earlier in the year. Crandell said that the greater increase was driven 
almost entirely by independent producers. "In our survey,
 227 independents indicated E&P spending growth in 2000 of 26.1 percent 
versus a 22.9 percent increase budgeted for the
 year in December," he indicated. "Some 40 percent of the independents we 
surveyed have increased their U.S. E&P budgets,
 while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last 
December. Higher natural gas prices and increased
 cash flow are the main drivers behind this."

 Crandell said that Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: APC), Apache Corp. (NYSE: 
APA), BHP Petroleum, H.S. Resources Inc.
 (NYSE: HSE), McMoRan Exploration Co. (NYSE: RAN), MDU Resources Group Inc. 
(NYSE: MDU), Mitchell Energy and
 Development Corp. (NYSE: MND.A and MND.B), Santa Fe Snyder Corp. (NYSE: 
SFS), Stone Energy Corp. (NYSE: SGY) and
 Titan Exploration Inc. - now Pure Resources Inc. (NYSE: PRS) - were among 
the larger independents to make the most
 significant upward revisions. The ones that significantly reduced planned 
U.S. E&P outlays for the year included Barrett
 Resources Corp. (NYSE: BRR), Belco Oil and Gas Corp. (NYSE: BOG), Burlington 
Resources Inc. (NYSE: BR), Coastal Corp.
 (NYSE: CGP), Forcenergy Inc. (NYSE: FEN), Houston Exploration Co. (NYSE: 
HEX), Kerr-McGee Corp. (NYSE: KMG), Mariner
 Energy Corp. and Williams Production Co.

 The survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage 
gain in their 2000 U.S. E&P expenditures (8.8
 percent) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year (8.4 percent). 
Among the 14 companies in this category, 31
 percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 E&P spending estimates 
during the first six months, including Amerada Hess
 Corp. (NYSE: AHC), Conoco Inc. (NYSE: COC.A and COC.B), Occidental Petroleum 
Corp. (NYSE: OXY)and Total Fina Elf S.A.
 (NYSE: TOT). Another 19 percent - including ENI SpA (NYSE: E), Royal 
Dutch/Shell (NYSE: RDP and STT) and Texaco Inc.
 (NYSE: TX) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates, while the 
remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey
 remained the same.

 'The increase in Canada... is nothing short of staggering...'

 "The increase in Canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is 
nothing short of staggering," Crandell continued. Of
 the 85 companies that he contacted, 44.7 percent budgeted higher 
expenditures for 2000 than for 1999. "Compared with
 December, 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000 
by more than 10 percent, while 20 percent
 have reduced it by more than 10 percent. The remaining 39 percent have kept 
it within 10 percent of what was originally
 estimated," Crandell said. Talisman Energy Inc. (NYSE: TLM) led the group 
with a huge increase, followed by Anderson
 Exploration Ltd. (TSE: AXL), Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. (NYSE: GOU), Murphy 
Oil Corp. (NYSE: MUR), Pan Canadian
 Petroleum Ltd. (TSE: PCP) and Shell Canada Ltd. (TSE: SHC). Like their U.S. 
counterparts, producers above the border raised
 their 2000 E&P budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash 
flow, according to the Lehman analyst.

 He said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise: "The 14.9 
percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas
 companies that have operations outside the United States and Canada was well 
above the 5.7 percent increase for 2000
 estimated last December. As in other geographies, there were more companies 
that increased budgets than decreased them."
 Overall, Crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised 
their 2000 E&P budgets by more than 10 percent, 43
 estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated 
that they would spend less than originally planned.
 He said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which 
materially increased their budgets, including
 Texaco, Petroleos Brasileiros S.A., Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. and Repsol YPF 
S.A. (NYSE: REP) among the multinationals and
 Amerada Hess, Apache, Premier Oil Plc. and Woodside Energy among mid-sized 
companies.

 Crandell noted that while respondents' average price assumptions rose during 
2000's first six months (to $22.04 from $19.25
 per barrel of crude oil and to $2.58 from $2.38 per thousand cubic feet of 
natural gas), they still trail current prices and what
 Lehman Brothers estimates for the year ($28 per barrel of crude and $3.30 
per Mcf of gas). "This suggests a stronger second
 half than expected, should companies raise budgets further to reflect the 
higher prices," he said.

Hi, everybody,

following up on our discussions on stressing correlations I made a 
spreadsheet and a DLL. 
Here is what it does:

in the input ("Main" sheet) the user has to specify:
-the size of the correlation matrix;
-the row and column for the element he wants to stress (row=1 and col=3 in 
the example)
-the integer number N_iter;
-the original correlation matrix.

In the output (see sheet "Results") we see 2 columns:
-the first column contains possible correlation values (from -1 to 1, 
N_iter+1 numbers) for the element (1,3),
 -the second column contains the smallest eigenvalue for the "stressed" 
correlation matrix 
(which is the same as the original matrix except the elements (1,3) and (3,1) 
which take values from -1 to 1).

Thus, the user can see which values for the chosen element (1,3) are 
permitted 
(those for which the smallest  eigenvalue is positive (marked green in the 
example).

The user might decide that he wants to assign the correlation which is "not 
permitted" to this particular element   
(the smallest eigenvalue is negative). Then the user might have a few options:
1. all the elements of the correlation matrix will be modified so that the 
chosen element has the
desired correlation in it, but the change in the correlation matrix is the 
"smallest" possible
(in the sense of matrix norm) (this is my next step to do for this 
spreadsheet).
2. Just one column (and the corresponding row, of course) will change, while 
the rest of the matrix
will stay unchanged (Kevin's suggestion). In this case the user have to 
choose which column (and row)
he prefers to modify (in my example - column-row 1 or column-row 3).

We can discuss this approach with Risk Control and see how they like it. I 
send you only the spreadsheet with an example now.

Tanya.

Just wanted to pass a quick note to say thanks for all of your help that the 
three of you each gave me concerning cluster analysis.  Your help was 
invaluable .  As you may have been aware, we were performing the cluster 
analysis to define the commercial zones in ERCOT.  I only had a few days in 
which to learn the FASTCLUS procedure in SAS and prepare graphical views of 
the results.  

Your assistance ensured that Enron was seen as one of three market leaders 
who had the capability to perform the analysis and cross check other market 
participants analysis.  We were the only participant who had the ability to 
graphically  display the results.  

I was able to take the lead in a commercial meeting because of the data and 
results.  I just wanted you guys to know that I really appreciated your help.

I have attached a couple of files that show some of the results.  The 
presentation has the best overview.

  

Best Regards,
Lance

Vince,
                I quite agree, we have to separate out price and position, 
and that is what we have done with the historical simulations/EVT ideas.  We 
have taken today's delta-gamma, hold that frozen, and gone back historically 
and looked at price changes and see what happens to portfolio changes.    
Garman and company have looked at gross historical portfolio changes, which I 
agree is not the best approach, due to the artificiality imposed by largest 
Net Open Positions (NOP), such as we have seen recently.
         
Regards
Naveen

Tanya, Naveen,

Just a thought. Changes in the portfolio values may combine both the changes 
of prices and positions.
This happens if one tracks changes in the value of our historical gas 
portfolio. A big jump in
the volumetric position from day to day, combined with a moderate price 
movement may produce an
observation that looks artificially big.

If the volumetric position was frozen, it's just a scaling factor and there 
should be 
no discrepancy between your numbers. Of course, the correct approach
is to separate the price process from the position changes. 

Vince

Naveen,
I am trying to answer the question: what is the appropriate stochastic 
process to model the behavior
of commodities' prices in our VAR model. So what  I do care about is the 
behavior of log-returns. 
Any help is appreciated.

Tanya,
               We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an 
extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree 
for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.  

Regards
Naveen

Subject: Re: looking for "Fat Tails" in time-series for NGI-SOCAL  

Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

See the spreadsheet is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya

I have attached a background piece to brief oil traders on this subject prior 
to a possible meeting with them.

Please give me any comments on 1) accuracy  2) completeness and 3) coverage 
of the areas we want to explore.

As a side note, I found some info on the web stating current proven oil 
reserves are 1,000 billion bbls.  Discovery of a 1 billion bbl field would 
add only 0.1 %.  While we will pursue the trading advantage option, it is not 
looking promising that it has great short term value, given the long time 
frame and high cost of bringing deep water reserves to market.

PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL

A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides.  Here are the main points from their conversation

1.	Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt

Corroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that "he was surprised they hadn't already."  He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that "they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent" and that "their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it."

He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the "Plan B's" are "speculative" at best.  He also thought that SoCal was being "naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court."

2.	Bond Issuance- $12B Not Enough

Angelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B.   The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that "$12B was all the market could handle."  The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.

3.	New Generator Construction

Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will "build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.  Angelides expects the state to be "5-10% short on power all summer."

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack 
of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the 
bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a 
deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans 
and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is 
reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and 
Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the 
bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double dip" into 
the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and 
the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of 
the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  
Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term 
power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the 
bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of 
contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge 
loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very 
difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state 
would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General 
Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 
billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this 
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full 
disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the 
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they 
will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB 
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill 
passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of 
Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for 
community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be 
amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, 
currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should 
get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be 
likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). 
 
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, 
Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money 
available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated 
that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  
Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The 
Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, 
Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and 
there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.
 
Key Points of the Bridge Financing
Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B
Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B
   Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B
   Bear Stearns  $625 M
Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt
Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%
   Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%
Current Projected 
Blended IR:  5.38%
Maturity Date:  August 29, 2001

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the 
California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion 
authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be 
authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the 
additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing 
power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these 
authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the 
governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond 
amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to 
support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 
6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  
for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  
the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  
be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this 
idea  earlier in the crisis.
 
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The 
first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the 
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is 
August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According 
to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has 
signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis 
and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates 
that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary 
bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  

The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond 
issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) 
stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, 
then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the 
state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and 
passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for 
bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and 
the DWR proportionately from rate payments.

Japan's Electricity Newspaper ("Denki Shimbun", the equivalent of Megawatt 
Daily) has been running a series of articles about the new century.  Several 
of these have focused on the power industry in the U.S.  A friend of mine ran 
across one on Enron that was published on April 13 and sent it to me.  I 
thought you would find it interesting.

The article focuses on EES in particular and about how we try to succeed by 
being first to meet our clients' changing needs.  It also describes how we 
use derivatives and risk management to reduce costs and stay competitive.  
The article also briefly mentions the new office in Japan.

The most interesting thing about the article is how incredibly positive it is 
about Enron.  Given what I have read and heard about how nervous the Japanese 
are about deregulation of the industry, I really did not expect such praise.

Denki Shimbun also has a web site at "www.shimbun.denki.or.jp".  They have 
small summaries of the important articles of the day (the site, however, is 
completely in Japanese).  Another interesting site is 
"www.criepi.denken.or.jp", the English home site of Japan's Central Research 
Institute of Electric Power Industry (Denryoku Chuo Kenkyuujou).  The site 
has many links to other English-language sites related to the power industry 
in Japan.

Regards,



Eugenio

Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at 
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example 
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay 
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed 
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for 
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a 
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn 
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is 
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would 
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.  
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have 
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. 
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum 
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of 
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and 
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take 
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the 
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, 
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Anjam,

We can use moment matching to find the "effective" volatility and dividend 
yield for the average.
Then we can apply the European digital option formula.   Attached please find 
the c-code I did
for  Asian spread option, when I find the effective vol and drift for both 
averages then find the option
value by calling the European spread option.  You can do just the same for 
the Asian digital option.

It would be nice to do a Monte-Carlo, just checking the accuracy of the 
approximation.

It was nice to have you here, we are impressed by the work you have done.
Keep up the good work.

Zimin

Subject: Aluminium Asian Digital Options

Hi Zimin,


Russell Placket of MG Metals just talked to me about the issue of pricing a 
strip of twelve monthly Asian digital options on LME aluminium.  As I 
understand, the payoff to the customer is a fixed cash amount that wil be 
paid if the average of the closing prices of aluminium for a month are 
greater than the strike agreed in advance, where holiday days do not 
contribute to the average.

Russell mentioned that this would be a set of 12 monthly options starting in 
Jan-01, and that the LME price for Jan-01 of $1572.5 (which is the future 
converging to the spot price on the 3rd Wednesday in Jan 01) can be used as a 
proxy/estimate for the average for the month.

Do you have a model for asian digitals or should I proceed with Monte Carlo 
to price this, maybe using European digital option model as control variate?

Thanks,

Anjam

Subject: extreme value theory applied to weather

Dear Vince,

Back in July, when you visited our Sydney office you mentioned extreme value 
theory. I am wondering whether research is looking into the application 
of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news 
article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min, 
etc. 

I am in particular referring to the news article below:

http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm

In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for 
t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the
past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in 
particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could 
provide a meaningful tool for the analysis. 

Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has 
a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts 
of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich) 
is indicating the application of EVT to V@R....


Thank you! 


Regards,
Christian

Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack=
 of Support
Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the=
 bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline.   Any possibility for a=
 deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=
ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=
us is reportedly "unwilling to fight" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=
ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=
nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would "double=
 dip" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=
islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=
e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=
e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=
g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=
hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =
breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=
e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=
ll be very difficult.

The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=
e would "eat" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=
 Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =
$8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =
concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=
l disclosure of the governor's plan for handling the crisis, including the =
details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=
 will support the bond issuance to go forward.

Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =
31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=
ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=
k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=
r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=
ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=
ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen's language states that the state should get =
paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=
kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20
=20
According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=
ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =
the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =
of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=
icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=
 to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=
rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=
ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.

Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time
The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=
he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=
 authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=
horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=
tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =
going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=
ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =
has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =
that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=
urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =
is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=
ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=
ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=
dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=
ier in the crisis.
=20
SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy
At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=
he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =
governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=
gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=
o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=
igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=
s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=
es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=

The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please 
treat with discretion.

Executive Summary:
? FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives. 
Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from 
an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new 
power generation
? Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of 
out-of-state generators
? June 1st "kill clause" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional 
plan
? California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected 
$20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper 
Administration involvement
? QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court
? New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling
? Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout 
deal

1. FERC Fallout
The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks 
like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to 
continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to 
allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape 
shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the 
Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the 
Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the 
forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps 
on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the 
construction of new generation.

It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were 
generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who 
favors price caps actually voted against this plan. 

2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps
 From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws:
? The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west. 
Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to 
California.
? As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power 
than a ceiling.
? State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game 
the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2 
emergency and does not require any collusion.
? Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the 
highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require 
wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the 
cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.

3. Proposal "Kill Clause" Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis
The FERC proposal includes a "kill clause" that says the caps will be 
withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the 
regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the 
regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines 
blaming him for letting the "Bush price caps plan" collapse.

4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California
Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion 
on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of 
PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the 
situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take 
further action to control prices for  power.

The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about 
90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to 
finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.  
The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge 
loans they are providing to California.

The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness 
of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will 
have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating 
deficits in a matter of months.

5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E
Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the 
bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts, 
since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for 
gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the  
QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw  
of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.
 
6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation
The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being 
continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those 
contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.

7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan
Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an 
analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  
utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number 
of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a 
"non-bypassable" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even 
if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is 
no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be 
used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would 
be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According 
to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private 
company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for 
the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  
stand a likely constitutional challenge.  

8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts
The issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term 
power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.  
Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been 
negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will 
challenged, creating an even further delay.

Subject: Price Caps

The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that 
I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me 
know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of 
Enron.

Regards,
Tim

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

Y'all,

Stinson forwarded a copy to me last week.  Part 1.1 was published in this 
past Monday's edition as is.  I would suggest that unless you see some major 
error, don't suggest changes to Samer that would delay the publication of 
Part 2, scheduled for this coming Monday.

Attached is a draft of the Vega VaR implement documentation.  We will discuss 
this issue tomorrow.

Index VaR and the Vega VaR status:
Because any modification of the VaR model has to be coded into the new 
version by IT,  the Index VaR model and the Vega VaR model are on the waiting 
list to get into  IT group's door.  Currently, they are struggling with the 
Credit Model.  Accord to Jonathan Le, they will implement the "Prudency" 
model after the "Credit" and before anything else.  So, it's uncertain when 
they can begin these two projects.

Credit Reserve Model status:
New version developed by IT is still in the debugging stage.  Two major 
difference exist between the new and old versions:
1)  Old version uses delta-gammar methodology, new version uses full 
evaluation.  IT group is not comfortable with their implementation of the 
"Spread option" and "Swaption" evaluation.  I am working with them on it.
2) Insurance projects are new to the new version.  IT also wants our help too.

Only after the IT finishes the debugging process, could we start testing the 
new version with the current one.

Thanks.

Vincent

Zimin,

 to generalize your initial comment, for any process dS = Mu(S,t)*S*dt + 
Sigma(S,t)*S*dz,
the delta-hedging argument leads to the Black-Scholes PDE.  
This is true for any arbitrary functions Mu and Sigma, and so includes GBM, 
Mean Reversion, and others.
There is no problem with this, because in the risk-neutral world, which is 
what you enter if you can hedge,
the drift of the "actual" process is irrelevant.

I believe your concern is that you would like to see a different option price 
for Mean Reversion process.  This can only happen if the asset is not 
hedgeable, and so the actual dynamics then need to be factored into the 
option pricing.   If you assume that the underlying is a non-traded factor, 
then the PDE will have to reflect the market price of risk, and the drift of 
the actual process is then reflected in the PDE.

Dear All,

I have a fundamental question back in my mind since 95.    Hope you can give 
me a convincing answer .

Zimin

---------------------------------

In deriving BS differential equation, we assume the underlying follows GBM

ds= mu*s*dt + sigma*s*dz

where mu is the drift, sigma is the volatility, both can be a function of s.

Then we use delta hedging argument, we obtain the BS differential equation 
for the option price, regardless
of mu.  

With the BS PDE and boundary condition, we can derive BS formula.  Fine. No 
problem.

Question comes here.   Suppose the underlying is traded security and follows, 
say, mean-reverting process

ds=beta(alpha-s)dt + sigma*s*dz

Apparantly, this SDE leads to a different probability distribution. However, 
using the delta hedging argument,
we still get the same BS differential equation, with the same boumdary 
condition, we get the same BS formula.  
Not fair !

>From another angle, I can derive the distribution from the BS PDE for the 
underlying, which is the lognormal distribution.
My thinking is: can I drive the distribution for any SDE from the option PDE 
?  The answer should be yes, but got to be
from a different PDE rather than BS PDE.  Then what we do about the 
delta-hedging argument ?

Thanks.

Vince,
I have put together a parameter estimation model, which is continuation of 
Tanya's model.
The estimation process is more consistent now. Attached are the model and a 
brief
write-up of the methods. If you see any problem/ways to improve it, please 
let me know.

Best,

Stinson ,Vince ,Zimin,

Here's a brief document on constraints on the shape of a smile for a fixed 
expiry date.
the constraints are neccessary and sufficient for no arbitrage in this case.
I've used a template created by Dr. Leppard which is why it looks so scary. 

If you need constraints in the time direction then I will have to think a 
little bit more about it.
I think constraints in this direction are very model depenendent e.g. 
stochastic volatility and local volatility models
will throw up different constraints.





Steve,
I am not sure if our traders (or quants for that matter) are aware of these 
constraints
and some desks are beginning to build smiles...

Regards
Sharad

Jason,

I think what you may be asking for are CalISO power prices.  The CalPX is a
scheduling coordinator and they submit balanced schedules and bid curves to
the CalISO.  The ISO combines the curves from participating SCs (of which I
believe Enron is one) and calculates the uncongested and congested prices. 
The CalISO prices are available from RDI PowerDat, the Enron LIM database, and
a number of other sources.  Recent historical prices are available from the
CalISO web site.

I am copying your mail to Tim Hiezenrader, who runs the Westdesk Fundamentals
group.  I believe he would know how you might be able to access the more
real-time CalISO data that Enron collects.

Tim, can you help Jason out?  He is a manager in the ENA Research Group.

Thanks,
Michael

Mike,

My number for next week is 66 (from Seasonal Holt-Winter model, SHW).

I am also fitting AGA to an ARIMAX model.  As discussed, I need weighted 
temperature
data for east, west and production areas.   I would appreciate if you could 
provide that data.
 After that, I could add forward price curve as explainatory variables. 

Since AGA is a market mover, it is important to have an accurate model.

Spotlight Report 
  Exchange products seeing slow trading
  GAVIN SOUTER

  03/20/2000 
  Business Insurance 
  Page 3 
  Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights
  reserved. 

  Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have
  been somewhat slow to get off the ground.

  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since
  the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a
  significant volume of trades.

  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away
  from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains
  abundant and relatively cheap.

  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major
  natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will
  remain limited, observers say.

  Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the
  limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he
  said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one
  contract against another.

  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to
  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has
  not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,
  capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in
  New York.

  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not
  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way
  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified
  portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently
  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that
  hedge, he said.

  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then
  hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.
  stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane
  explained.

  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to
  natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he
  said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop
  indexes, Mr. Lane said. "For the insurance buyer, such exchange
  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but
  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a
  good surrogate," he said.

  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of
  catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.

  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of
  exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior
  vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance
  brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.

  "The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not
  looking for other ways of doing business," he said.

  At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar
  to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success
  since they were introduced in the 1970s. "There is a belief that
  alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to
  predict when," Mr. Mooney said.

  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves
  established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not
  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.

  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities
  Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,
  however, and was suspended last year after two years of little
  activity.

  The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative
  products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board
  of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.

  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft
  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge
  catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker
  at the CBOT who trades in options.

  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT
  so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in
  the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were
  traded, Mr. Purty said.

  "I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they
  really take off," he said.

  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to
  trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance
  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative
  coverage options, Mr. Purty said.

  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has
  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in
  mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,
  chief operating officer.

  CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for
  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks
  and to build balanced portfolios.

  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it
  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX
  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney
  said.

  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of
  risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.
  Sweeney said.

  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a "cash for cover"
  exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange
  include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability
  coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where
  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry
  loss over an agreed threshold.

  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible
  through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX
  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them
  form groups whose members do business only with one another.

  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,
  totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,
  he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,
  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their
  captives, Mr. Sweeney said.

  "We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied
  with what we have achieved so far," Mr. Sweeney said.

  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents
  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their
  existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was
  a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last
  year.

  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field
  of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather
  derivatives .

  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry
  Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.

  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against
  weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in
  a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a
  resultant fall in revenues.

  The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,
  Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,
  Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering
  contracts based on cold weather.

  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers
  themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more
  extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.

  In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.

I have completed an evaluation of a "backwardation" hedge strategy requested 
by Wendy King.  The stratregy is intended to hedge oil inventories and is 
based of trading Nymex futures and options.

Wendy has suggested she wants to review this with Jeff Shankman.  I would 
like to review my conclusions with you before I send it to Wendy and will ask 
Shirley to set up a meeting.

A writeup is attached.

Here are excerpts from some work I recently did for EPRI. Perhaps you will
find it of some interest.

I don't have the right to send you the whole article but I was allowed to
send you some excerpts.

Naturally, this is intended for you alone.

I have included provision for providing rank correlation between "jump 
occurrence in daily average power price" and "outage occurrence".  The model 
will provide the same claim distribution as before when PriceVsOutage 
Correlation = 0 is used.  Claim goes up as the correlation is increased.  I 
have performed some sensitivity analysis and the results seem to make sense.  

The new model workbook is "OutagePricingModel040901.xls" and corresponding 
dll is "OutagePricing040901.dll", both located in 
O:\GRM\RESEARCH\OUTAGERISK\  subdirectory.  The price vs. outage rank 
correlation input will need to be provided in "MAIN" spreadsheet.  Please 
call me if you have any questions.

Weather derivatives is increasingly a hot topic on the web at the
moment. Four sites have been launched in the last three months,
including tradeweather.com, weather-risk.com and WeatherRiskAdvisory.com.
Along with the weather trading site from Liffe (I-WeX.com),
launched in January, and the introduction last September of
weather futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), there is
something of a rush on.

To provide you with an online resource to weather risk, we have
an introductory guide, two site reviews, 22 articles and an
exclusive book offer.

Bhavna:

The basis report has been updated to cover 2000 prices. It is called 
Basisnw7.xls and is in the ERG database.
It looks to be working correctly, but of course without data it is a little 
hard to confirm.  As always, it is ultimately your job to verify that the 
numbers reported are correct.  Lemme know if there are problems.  

It is easy to change the spreadsheet to start a new year.  You should keep 
this mail message as a reference.
1)  Add 12 to the expression in "PrintMacro"!B35 i.e. change 
COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+63,i,12,1)) to 
COPY(OFFSET(HenryCash,12*AgainstYear+75,i,12,1))

2) Define a new cell reference on the basis page for the first date to be 
printed out on the report page.  For example, last year, the basis report 
went from Jan 93 to Dec 1999. In Basisnw6.xls there is a name "Jan93" defined 
as "Basis"!A64 (i.e. refers to the row where the Jan 1993 basis numbers are 
recorded).  This year, in Basisnw7.xls, I defined  "Jan94" to refer to 
"Basis"!A76.  That's because the basis report will now run from Jan 1994 to 
Dec 2000.

3)  Change the expression in "PrintMacro"!B45 to use this new cell reference 
i.e.  change COPY(OFFSET(Jan93,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1)) to 
COPY(OFFSET(Jan94,12*IndexYear,Report,12,1))

4) Having executed steps 1) - 3) the spreadsheet will now print numbers 
shifted up by one year.  All that remains to do is to change the dates on the 
"PrintFormat" page to be one year more.  By that I mean change 1998 to 1999, 
1999 to 2000, change 98/99 to 99/00, etc.  Don't move any numbers or formulas!


That's it.  As we discussed Bhavna, while I am happy to do this for you, it 
is not in your or my best interest for this to continue.  Please do work to 
find some one in your shop to maintain this spreadsheet.


Regards, and Happy New Year!
Grant.

? A source within the generator community confirms press reporting that Coram 
Energy plans to file an involuntary bankruptcy early next week.  Through an 
intermediary, we were able to corroborate this information with a senior 
member of the CA ISO board.  Coram  Energy is a relatively small wind 
generator QF based in West Vancouver, British  Columbia, though it also owns 
wind stations in California.  Coram has 238  40 kw units.  
? The source believes that this filing may have been precipitated by the  
fact that many people believe it would take a blackout for Governor Davis  to 
be able to get his bailout plan passed by the legislature.  It is  unlikely 
that blackouts would happen in April or May, meaning a  long wait for the 
cash strapped QFs to wait to get paid.
? The filing will be against Socal.
? In order to file an involuntary bankruptcy, Coram  would have to file along 
with at least two other creditors owed $10,000 or more.  Sources report Coram 
has two other creditors who will file with them (working on finding out who 
they are).
? Sources also report that other QFs are "taking  legal advice" on how to 
proceed in light of these developments.

Subject: California Power 1/15/01

As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on 
for the California electricity crisis, state officials around Governor Gray 
Davis have
  toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed 
they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be 
paid by the
  State of California. One problem on that front is still how much producers 
want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and 
his aides
  want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want 
about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best 
way to
  determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market 
approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term 
contracts.

Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the 
view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term 
power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the 
utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This week's legislative 
activities
in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing 
purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to 
finance power 
purchases after utility bankruptcy.

1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships

California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment 
front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that 
half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to 
themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations

This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both 
the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a 
holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E 
and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices 
was bought from themselves. 

  But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that 
Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part 
of any 
potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to 
use state credit to eliminate the "risky debt" premium that PG&E 
and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and 
that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase
 utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In 
return he is demanding that the companies prepare to "share the 
burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension."

2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money

 Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back 
debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up
during a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by 
all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis' idea, as
he laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize 
the debts and sell them against the utilities' forward rate base or by 
establishing a
medium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees. 

 In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without 
direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to
paydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the 
$50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can 
pay
down this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state 
guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remains
opposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton 
administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much 
flexibility.

3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation

  Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury 
and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political
  advisers have with "non-market" solutions to the energy crisis. Although 
the Governor's aides actually believe the weapon is more a "way to force 
eventual
  agreement, than an actual solution," the talk returns frequently to these 
non-market mechanisms. "We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by 
the
  Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will 
turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and 
we will re-take
  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves," a close political aide to 
Davis said. "We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the 
reserved parking
  places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second."

At its special meeting today, FERC released the results of its eagerly 
awaited probe into California's summer power crisis, concluding that under 
certain circumstances, California ratepayers were subjected to unjust and 
unreasonable power rates due to California's "seriously flawed" market 
structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions 
throughout the West.

The FERC staff report on western markets and the causes of the Summer 2000 
Price Abormalities, entitled, Part I of Staff Report on U.S. Bulk Power 
Markets, is available at the following website: 
http://www.ferc.fed.us/electric/bulkpower.htm

In response, FERC issued an order proposing a series of sweeping structural 
changes to the California ISO and PX to help remedy the pricing problems, and 
solicited public comment by November 22.  A technical conference has also 
been scheduled for November 9, to discuss the proposed solutions and other 
remedies that might be suggested (details TBA).  While all four commissioners 
supported the order, the order stretched the Commission.  Chairman Hoecker 
and Comm. Breathitt expressed strong endorsements, while Comms. Hebert and 
Massey concurred, citing areas where they felt the Commission had either 
"over-reached" or not gone far enough, as discussed below.  A final order is 
expected to be issued by year's end.

At the same time, the Commission warned California consumers of their 
continued risk of paying higher prices unless policy makers there resolve 
state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day 
ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3) 
siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient 
reserve requirements.

Highlights of Proposed California Structural Remedy

In its order, FERC proposed a series of market overhauls, including:

(1) Eliminating the state's mandatory requirement that the state's 
investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the PX, and allowing
these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other 
alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks.

(2) Requiring market participants to schedule 95 percent of their 
transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for 
under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in 
order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market.

(3) Establishing independent, non-stakeholder governing boards for the ISO 
and PX.

(4) Modifying the current single price auction system by (a) imposing a 
temporary $150/MWh "soft cap" that prohibits supply bids in excess of $150 
from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders; (b) requiring sellers 
bidding above $150/MWh to report their bids to FERC on a confidential, weekly 
basis and provide certain cost support; and (c) requiring the ISO and PX to 
report monthly information on such bids.  The Commission's price mitigation 
measures would remain in effect through December 31, 2002.

(5) Declining to order retroactive refunds for the state's ratepayers and 
utilities, citing insufficient authority to do so, but subjecting sellers to 
potential refund liability for transactions from October 2, 2000 until 
December 21, 2002, but no lower than their marginal or opportunity costs, if 
FERC finds non-competitive behavior.

(6) Encouraging accelerated state siting approval and introduction of demand 
response management programs.

Separately, the draft order rejected the ISO's request for an extension of 
its current purchase price cap authority, and the PX's request for price 
capping authority.

Commissioner Responses

Comm. Herbert reluctantly concurred, noting that his decision may change when 
a final order is considered based on comments filed or testimony offered at 
the November 9 meeting.  He stressed that he would have preferred that the 
order address four areas: (1) eliminate all price controls in California 
markets; (2) abolish the single price auction entirely; (3) terminate the 
"buy and sell" mandate in the PX; and (4) direct the ISO to address a long 
list of cited problems in its January 2001 RTO filing, rather than having the 
Commission prescribe specific remedies.

Hebert stated that while he was opposed in principle to the "soft cap" 
concept, if one had to be adopted, then the soft cap should increase 
incrementally increase over time at specific pre-announced dates.  He 
believes that this would serve to both encourage greater investment in 
facilities and additional forward contracting as well as provide an incentive 
for California regulators to address market design and other flaws.  Also, he 
would not have disbanded the stakeholder governing boards at this time, but 
allow the ISO and PX to address this issue in their January 2001 RTO 
filings.  In addition, he would not dictate risk management methods, 
preferring instead that market participants determine appropriate actions on 
their own.  Finally, he advised Californians not to be so environmentally 
focused that they do not realize their tremendous need for generation 
capacity.

Comm. Breathitt stated her approval of the Order while warning that FERC 
cannot allow the events of this past summer to reverse or slow the progress 
towards open and competitive markets.  She noted that it was the Commission's 
job to guide the market to self-correct and not to conduct "command and 
control."  She also commended the managers of the ISO and PX, saying that 
they have performed admirably.  However, she noted she is awaiting comments 
on the single price auction remedy and its accompanying confidential 
reporting requirements.

Comm. Massey concurred, but emphasized that he advocates a more aggressive 
approach.  He feels that the Congress has "put its thumb on the scale" in the 
Federal Power Act to protect consumers.  Stating that prices will continue to 
be unreasonable in the future, he believes that this Order moves in the right 
direction, by proposing solutions to identified problems such as an over 
reliance on the spot market, lack of demand response, the need to 
reconstitute governance of the ISO and PX and the elimination of the buy/sell 
mandate.  Comm. Massey specifically called for comments regarding whether the 
$150/MWh soft cap went far enough, whether FERC has the legal authority to 
issue refunds and to determine whether there should be a requirement for a 
certain percentage of forward contracting to hedge against the spot market 
price volatility.

Finally, Chairman Hoecker stated his strong support of the Order, but noted 
that this is "no time to pull punches."  He emphasized that the Commission 
needed frank comments from the industry.  He echoed Comm. Breathitt's warning 
that competition is at risk and that they needed to get the markets back on 
track.  Noting that the Commission lacked authority to order refunds, he 
stated that the responsibility rests with Congress.  Addressing 
jurisdictional issues, he stated that siting problems encountered at the 
state level are slowing the "meandering transition" to competition.  He feels 
that the state of California and FERC need to work together to resolve these 
problems and that FERC is not attempting to usurp power.  Rather, California 
is part of a broader interstate market and is dependent on the western region 
for reliable energy, thus placing the burden on federal action to make things 
work, Hoecker maintained.  The Chairman also said that the Commission will 
fully investigate and act upon complaints of market power abuse or further 
evidence provided by staff's ongoing investigation.

Vince,

I can send you a Scientific Word DVI file (at the weekend) if you can read
SCientific Word files ?  The dissertation hasn't been reviewed by Les or the
External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the
Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to
both our company's businesses - although I ultimately didn't have the time
to 'explicitly' price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly
implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options -
rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a
rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be
made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.

In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and
essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :

1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is "incomplete" (synthesising
the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) -
note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with
'term structure' securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and
Das and;

2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for 'implementing' the price
of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth
process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of
CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).


Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done
much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation
framework ?  I'm about to start a project evaluation of embedded
optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward
gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion
and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of
out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a pure-diffusion
framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available
market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve
for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition
means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility
function, and jumps are less easy to calibrate.  Any suggestions ?

Regards


Bernard

Hello Vince,

My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les
Clewlow,
who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at
Warwick
Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump
Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
come to my attention :

"The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US
POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.

and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present
and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.

Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at
University
of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK,
where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach
(spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.

Thanks in advancve

Bernard Murphy

John,

We can approach this problem this way.  Basically you are asking how
the total variance (66%)2*143 are distributed among 113 days and the last?30 days.   Assuming volatility for the first period is simga1 and that in the ?last 30 ?days is sigma2, then??(66%)2*143=sigma12*113+sigma22*30

Futhermore, we can use Nov-00 implied volatility as a proxy to sigma1, then 
we can
calculate sigma2 which is the volatility for Dec-00 contract in the last 30 
days.

sigam2=sqrt((66%)2*143-sigma12*113)/30.

Make sense ?

Zimin, I am trying to understand what the near winter NG implied vols will 
look like as they approach expiration.  For example, is it possible to infer 
what the implied volatility of the Dec00 NG contract will look like with 30 
days to expiry given we know current vol (66%) and term to maturity ( 143 
days)?

This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM.
During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees.
This means we've also doubled the number of wonderful people we've trained
and are supporting.
And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working
with you all.
One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a
strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled
and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And,
I'm happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work
with.
Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system
from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run
in the Windows 2000 environment.
We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price
curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of
pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization.
We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting.
We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to
select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own
databases.
We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage
infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and
GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases.
We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and
possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this
purpose.
In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing
licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to
conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find
out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as
some new ideas for GPCM.

I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM
during 1999.

o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support
o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle
Visual Basic programming issues
o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows
programming
o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET
optimization program
o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint
pipeline maps now available in GPCM
o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and
GASdat database
o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we
could get them corrected
o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better
product
o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year
o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans
and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed

We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an
even better year 2000.

Bob Brooks

Dear All,


I change the storage model output to its total value versus the unit value 
before.
The total value refers to the total present value of the storage capacity at 
given
status (initial conditions).

The way I calculate the unit value is 

(Total PV - S*capacity taken)/total capacity

which could suffer some negative numbers since S, the spot price could be
very high.  The correct way is to define the S as the average injection gas 
price, but
 this would be troublesome to compute.

By switching to total PV, the delta can be interpreted as total commodity 
delta for the
hedge.  Actually, Duffie also suggested using the total PV as the output in 
his audit
review.

I have attached the XLL model below.

Sources report that the bond authorization will be put to a vote today

The bridge loan financing bill will put to a vote today in the California 
Assembly.  The Republicans are currently in caucus until 3:30 PST and then 
will go to the floor for a vote.  The current situation is very fluid, but 
sources now indicate that the bill would pass with a simple majority vote, 
lacking the two-thirds needed for an immediate bond issuance.  If this is the 
case, the bill would not take effect for 90 days and the state would be 
forced to abandon its proposed bridge loan plans.  Absent of last minute 
financial rescues by Davis or a new longer bridge loan package (unlikely) 
Socal could seek voluntary bankruptcy.  The main problem would then be the 
waiting period for financial relief from the state through the transmission 
line purchase or other assistance.

There is an outside chance that Republican defectors could precipitate from 
the current caucus.  There is extreme pressure on the Republicans from Davis 
and Angelides.  If the bill failed due to lack of Republican support, it 
would provide Davis the opportunity to blame Republicans for on-going 
expenditures of $70M/day (power purchases), and a possible bankruptcy by 
Socal.  The last Republican who gave support to a democratic bill (AB 1X), 
Representative Bill Campbell, lost his job.  Sources also confirm that 
Democrats have not met with Republicans on the bond issuance since last week.

Shelley and Chris,

I have set up a template for pricing ROFRs.  The ROFR is priced as a series 
forward start options.

A forward start option gives the holder the right to exercise the option but 
the strike price
is set at the money in future before the option expiration.  The feature 
mimics the "matching the best bid"
in the ROFR.  The underlying for the option is the "best bid", which should 
be closely related to the
price differential between the two hubs that the pipeline connects. Therefore 
the ROFR is case dependent,
as Vince pointed out.  The volatility can be estimated from the "best bid" 
price history. 

With these inputs we can estimate the value of ROFR.  If you have any 
questions concerning the model
please feel free to call me or Vince.

Vince-

Something very interesting about natural gas storage (from the class).

The industry is rapidly adopting what are called "Operational Balancing 
Agreements," where the pipeline contracts with the producers and LDC's 
(public utilities) to handle all "imbalances" in shipping, namely all 
production shortfalls or overages or consumption likewise.  Shippers then 
always "book" what is scheduled to happen, and not what actually happens.  
The end result is that storage facillities associated with production regions 
are used to smooth out not only weekday-weekend seasonal patterns (the 
well-known "parking") but to insure issues of wellhead output as well. 
Cutting to the chase, storage facilities in producing regions are operated to 
insure the integrity of the pipeline system, and estimated marketed 
production is likely to be a better estimate of actual flow at the pipeline's 
receipt meter than is production less local storage.

Folks,

As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
such capability currently exists.
According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
as we know, has
constructed such a vessel.  

I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
have not
built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
operational and 
environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,
http://www.tecnomare.it/marine/project/ling.htm

Please let me know if any further research is needed.

Ken and Greg,

What we have been doing is absoutely fine under the assumption that the market
conditions move relatively small ( where Taylor series has fast convergence).
However, we could run into troubles when the market has a big move.

In order to have a error proof bucketing, we can use the following 
method(finite-difference), let me
know what you guys think how to implement it to the transport book.


Sensitivity to risk parameters, or P/L attribution by risk bucket:

Today's premium = Premium based on today's curves

Last day's premium = Premium based on last day's curves

Change due to
DeliveryCurveShift = [Premium based on today's delivery price and last day's 
receipt  price, volatilities, interest rate, last's time to expiration etc] - 
Last day's premium - today's change due to Gamma1

ReceiptCurveShift = [Premium based on today's receipt price and last day's 
everything else] - Last day's premium -today's change due to Gamma2

Vega1 = [Premium based on today's delivery volatility and last day's 
everything else] - Last day's premium

Vega2 = as above for gas volatility 

Rho =  as above for interest rate

Eta = as above for correlation

Theta = {[Premium based on today's days to expiration and last day's 
everything else] - Drift - Last day's premium } / 365.25

[This is a daily Theta.The sprdopt function returns an annualised theta.]

Gamma1 = 0.5 Last day's Gamma1' * PriceShift1 2??Gamma2 = 0.5 Last day's Gamma2' * PriceShift2 2

Last day's premium

Priceshift1 = Today's delivery price - Last day's delivery price

Priceshift2 = Today's receipt price - Last day's receipt price

In case you haven't already seen this:

El Paso Addresses the California Energy Situation  ( February 26, 2001 )
 HOUSTON, Feb. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- El Paso Corporation (NYSE: EPG)
reaffirmed today its continuing commitment to work with all parties
involved to help improve California's energy situation. "We are surprised
to see continuing misinformation in the media concerning El Paso's
involvement in California," said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of
Corporate Communications and External Affairs at El Paso Corporation. "We
would like to take this opportunity to clarify the record."  The
significant increase in electricity demand at a time when available power
supplies are short has caused a sharp climb in the price of power, which
has in turn increased the price of natural gas used to generate
electricity. High natural gas prices are, therefore, an effect rather than
a cause of the power shortage.  Allegations that natural gas prices were
deliberately manipulated by withholding capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas
pipeline overlook critical facts and are demonstrably untrue. It is not
possible for any holder of capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline to
cause a significant increase in California gas prices by refusing to use
that capacity. The El Paso Natural Gas pipeline is required by law to post
the availability of any unused capacity on its public bulletin board and is
obligated to sell that capacity for no more than the published tariff rate
found to be just and reasonable by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. All capacity held by El Paso Merchant Energy on the El Paso
Natural Gas Pipeline has been used or made available for use by others to
serve California and other Western markets.  Allegations that there was a
"conspiracy" in 1996 to limit new interstate pipeline capacity into
California are absolutely refuted by facts that no one can challenge. The
facts show that all new pipelines considered during the 1990s were either
built or were not viable projects because they lacked sufficient customer
support to justify their construction. For example, despite years of
marketing efforts by Tenneco, not a single potential customer could be
induced to make the sort of binding commitment required for the proposed
Altamont project to proceed. For that reason alone, it was ultimately
dropped. In 1996, according to estimates, there were between one and two
billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) of excess natural gas transportation
capacity on existing interstate pipelines serving California. Indeed, it
was misplaced reliance on the continuing availability of such excess
capacity that prompted the California Public Utilities Commission to
encourage PG&E, SoCal Edison, and SoCal Gas, beginning in 1996 and
continuing into 1998, to relinquish over 1.5 Bcf/d of firm transportation
capacity on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline. Processes are now under way
to assess present demand and support for new interstate pipeline capacity
into California, and El Paso intends to do its part to help satisfy
whatever needs may be established today.  As recently as last year, there
were periods when significant quantities of unused capacity were available
on the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline that were not necessary to meet demands
at that time. Notwithstanding its availability, this capacity was not used
by shippers to California to fill in- state natural gas storage facilities
for future use. If California had taken advantage of the opportunity in
2000 to store the same volumes of natural gas that had been stored in 1999,
reliance on the spot market would have been reduced and the steep rise in
prices at the California border could have been substantially mitigated or
avoided.  It is now widely recognized that the California "energy crisis"
was caused by the inability of the supply of power available in California
to keep pace with the state's economy and increased demand. A combination
of factors caused a sharp increase in power prices. First, the construction
of new power plants in California is a slow, difficult, and heavily
regulated process. As a result, the growing demand has far outstripped
in-state generating capabilities. Second, unfavorable precipitation and
increased out-of-state demand caused some of the hydroelectric power
normally relied on by California to become unavailable. Third, increased
demand for power in the western United States drove up prices that
California had to pay to out-of-state generators. Fourth, state policies
deregulated wholesale power prices but capped the rates paid by consumers,
leaving demand unrestrained and preventing utilities from recovering their
costs. Fifth, because rate caps prevented utilities from passing increased
costs to consumers, the utilities' creditworthiness was impaired, causing
supplemental power needed during peak periods to become more difficult and
expensive to purchase. Sixth, the early and greater-than-normal use of
peaking units-plants that are designed to only operate under peak demand
conditions-necessitated unscheduled maintenance, rendering them unavailable
at critical times. Seventh, during the final months of 2000, some power
plants were forced to shut down because increased usage exhausted their air
emissions credits. Eighth, a warm summer followed by an early onset of cold
weather further drove up demand for power. Finally, the increased power
costs in California could have been substantially mitigated through
long-term power contracts and less reliance on the volatile short-term
power market.  "California is currently in a difficult position, but now
has the opportunity to refine its regulatory model and craft a long-term
energy policy," said Dunn. "El Paso has been one of the largest suppliers
of energy to California for more than 50 years, and we are actively
participating with all parties in California to be a part of a long-term,
stable solution to California's energy needs."  El Paso Corporation, the
largest and most broadly based natural gas company in the world, spans the
energy value chain from wellhead to electron. With an enterprise value in
excess of $50 billion, El Paso is a leader in every phase of the natural
gas industry. The company owns and operates a significant portion of the
North American natural gas delivery grid, operates the fastest growing,
most sophisticated energy merchant group, and is the nation's third largest
natural gas producer. El Paso, a leader in risk management techniques, is
focused on maximizing shareholder value, transforming existing markets, and
speeding the development of new markets. Visit El Paso at www.epenergy.com.

Winston, 
I am sending you the documentation on the new methodology for creating ffvols
from implied vols. This methodology requires some minimization procedure
to fit the given vol curve with a smoothing function. I am sending you the
code I wrote that performs minimization with simulated annealing method from 
Numerical Recipes.

We might need to discuss some details. Please, let me know if you have 
questions.

Vince-

I spoke with Roy Kass of the Energy Information Agency this morning. Apart 
from clarifying the timeliness, or lack thereof, of the published 
state-specific wellhead production estimates, he indicates their scientists 
find severe weather in the fields (freezes, hurricanes) to be a far more 
significant issue in production, and in wellhead prices, than is severe 
weather in the Northeast, for instance. Also, he agrees with you as to there 
being strictly increasing marginal costs in production, there being a rich 
texture of wells in terms of their efficiency, technologies, maintenance and 
investment issues.

The Real Wolf

RECKONINGS
By PAUL KRUGMAN



ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect, chiding me
for my "Naderite" columns on the California energy crisis. He just
didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could
possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the
sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy
capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high
apartment rents. The left has cried "Wolf!" so many times that
sensible people have learned to discount such claims.

 But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is
doing terrible damage to our most populous state - and nobody will
believe it.

 True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages
even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable
competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that
market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring
billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the
generators.

 But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable
competition in California's power market, and that the actions of
generators "gaming the system" have greatly magnified the crisis.
The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of
more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale
prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has
kept the electricity market conveniently - and very profitably -
short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought
to be lots of excess capacity.

 As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the
state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is
a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly
whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for
other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And
such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that "generators use forced
outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market" - a
view shared by a growing number of other researchers.

 Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently
decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in
place on the California electricity market. I say "apparently"
because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to
be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1
vote, with William Massey - the one commissioner who has been
sympathetic to calls for price controls - voting against it on the
grounds that it would be ineffectual.

 What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in
emergency conditions - ignoring the fact that electricity prices
have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no
emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity
market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that
it is not.

 Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes,
offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls "megawatt
laundering" - selling power to affiliated companies that for one
reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for
example, the controls do not apply to "imports" from neighboring
states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds
that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at
the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive
to produce inefficiently: "I predict we will find some plants we
never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they
will be pretty inefficient."

 The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan.
There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there -
indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well
received by other experts - but FERC has ignored all of them.

 The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it,
that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf
is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action
was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls
the FERC plan "a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .
. a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to
deflect any political fallout" from the looming disaster.

 Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the
administration have yet to offer California any significant
relief.

Kim,  

After yestersday's meeting, I've come up with an idea which is applicable to 
the zone EF and
seems also to be applicable to the broader area. The model assumes that if 
there are positive spreads of energy
products between pairs of locations, we can always find the possibilities of 
swaptions. This assumption, as 
discussed with Jim and Sean, is a reasonable approximation. I suggest that 
the prototype be built up at this
model if you think that it is rational.  If you interested in the model, I 
will explain it to all of you. 

Best regards,

Youyi

Keith,

Both power and EMRS use a C library provided (also implemented) by research 
group. The methodology of greek calculations in power portcalc has not 
changed for more than 6 years since I joined Enron 6 years ago. Vince 
Kaminski, Stinson Gibner or Grant Masson should be able to help you with both 
questions.

I've been asked by Risk Management:

b) for a copy of the documentation of the methodology (greek calculations, 
etc.)

Hope you can help on both counts.

Dear all,

Attached is a paper describing the proposed methodology for pricing the 
"Bankruptcy Swaps" the Credit Markets group is launching next week. The 
methodology is intentionally simplistic - the emphasis has been on providing 
transparent models to give prices in a quick, easy-to-understand manner, 
rather than create any new "rocket science". Could one or all of you please 
review the paper, and give feedback on the approach and advice on the areas 
still under development. This will give us peace-of-mind before the big 
launch.

Bryan - could you reread this and outline the sections that need omitting or 
expanding for publication on the website.



Many thanks,

Ben

Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly 
Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting, 
followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings.

In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203 
merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be 
determined to be "workably competitive."  At the same time, FERC ordered a 
technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and 
urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next 
steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are 
provided below.

FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process

FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting 
requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as 
discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and 
more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over 
the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain 
entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products.

According to FERC, the draft Order:

-  revises the Commission's filing requirements to reflect existing merger 
policy based on FERC's 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines;
-  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market 
analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with 
potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes 
informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses.
-  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise 
competitive concerns; and
-  reduces the industry's regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing 
requirements.

The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal 
Register.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the 
Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC 
should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also 
analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC 
should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before, 
and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did 
mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission 
assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a 
separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative 
market analysis.

Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the 
approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the 
fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated 
that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting 
the public interest by stating that the process will be "efficient yet 
sufficient".  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule 
addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail 
competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality.

Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would 
improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the 
industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt, 
Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that 
will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants 
to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also 
stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERC's 
concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail 
competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and 
analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will 
provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into 
consideration the rapid changes in the industry.

Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was 
a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said 
that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERC's report before issuing their 
own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERC's expertise when 
reviewing mergers in the electric and gas industries.  There is a major 
positive connection between industry consolidation and RTOs and that both are 
reconfiguring the markets and effect how they work, he noted.  Because the 
RTOs enlarge the size of the subject market, he indicated, RTOs will help to 
preserve competition.  Therefore, more and larger RTOs should allow for more 
mergers, he said.  The Chairman cautioned that this is not to imply that 
joining an RTO is a requirement for a merger, but that it would certainly be 
viewed favorably.

NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably 
Competitive

In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be 
"workably competitive."  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical 
conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market 
participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and 
deadlines for resolution/implementation.

In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISO's September 1 and 8, 2000 
compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a 
temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISO's efforts to correct market 
flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had 
not yet satisfied the Commission's directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found 
that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the 
ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then 
gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISO's non-spinning reserve 
market by April 2001, as the ISO requested.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an "imperfect 
solution," yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the 
ISO's market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an 
opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls. 
Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack 
of the ISO's progress, but contended that significant outstanding issues must 
be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted.

In other action, FERC accepted NYISO's and NEPOOL's proposed Emergency Energy 
Transaction Agreement, allowing NYISO and ISO-NE to provide emergency service 
to each other (ER00-3638-000);

Stricken items included CAE-16 (NEPOOL's 64th Agreement Amendment proposing 
the elimination of In Service and instituting new rules governing certain 
import transactions (ER00-3577-000)).

Dear Vince and Grant,

I am currently reviewing some of the more erecent references on EVT and its 
application. I get back to you shortly with some points regarding the 
usefulness of EVT and how traders (electricity and weather) can benefit from 
EVT. 

Cheers,
Christian

Subject: Re: extreme value theory applied to weathet  

Christian:

To my knowledge, the research group is examining EVT primarily in the context 
of Value at Risk calculations.  We have not looked at EVT for power, because, 
to date, we have been focussing on shorter term fundamental forecasting of 
price excursions: i.e. given tomorrow's load forecasts and expected plant 
dispatch, we attempt to predict which lines will become constrained and how 
the system will react to alleviate these constraints. I would be interested 
in your thoughts on how EVT would benefit the traders however.  As far as the 
weather goes, I would expect the weather desk to use EVT at some level.  
Clearly you should talk to Joe Hrgovcic, the researhc chap attached to the 
weather desk, for a more accurate assessment.

Cheers,
Grant.

 Good morning.  I apologize for the response delay.  I've gone back through 
the analysis that I did back in April, and have thrown around some ideas with 
Vince and Stinson.  The issue may be summarized as follows.

 The hedge relationship was derived using JCC and prompt Brent, and is valid 
for JCC and prompt Brent.  No problems here.  However, it will not be valid 
for points far out on the forward curve.  Intuitively, this hedge 
relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve, but since 
there is no data, I can not statistically determine this.  One can imagine a 
term structure of heding ratios that start at 0.67 and move to 1.0, so that 
the back end of the curves would move together, but how fast it converges to 
one is anyone's guess.

 If there is a way of determining the historical JCC forward curve, then the 
hedge relationships may be estimated.  However, I have been unable to 
determine a rigorous approach to building the JCC curve.  

 I can explain this far better in person, and would like to talk as soon as 
possible at your convenience.

Subject: Transport Fuel P/L



Colleen,

After looking into the transport deals for NBPL (long term deal 1,2, 25,26), 
I think I figured it out why
we see positive fuel P/L for deal 1,25,and 26 and negative fuel P/L for deal 
2. 

The following plot shows NYMEX curve as of 8/23/00:




For short term, NYMEX moved up compared to that of 8/22/00, while the long 
term NYMEX moved down.

Here are the tenor for each deal:

Deal 1:   start 01-Sep-00, end 22-May-09,    the above graph suggested a 
positve fuel P/L
Deal 2:   start 01-sep-00, end 28-feb-02,       the above graph suggested a 
small negative P/L
Deal 25: start 01-may-02, end 28-feb-09,      the above graph suggested a 
positve fuel P/L
Deal 26: start 01-mar-09, end 31-may-09,    the above graph suggested a 
positve fuel P/L

The transport book seems to be correct on these fuel P/Ls. 

Another point worth to mention is that the fuel cost is related to index 
price (NYMEX+basis+index premium), to correctly interpret fuel P/L,
we need to look at the index curve change. 

Let me know your thoughts on this.

The Real Wolf

RECKONINGS
By PAUL KRUGMAN



ecently I received a letter from an economist I respect, chiding me
for my "Naderite" columns on the California energy crisis. He just
didn't believe that market manipulation by power companies could
possibly be an important issue; it sounded too much to him like the
sort of thing one hears from knee-jerk leftists, who blame greedy
capitalists for every problem, be it third-world poverty or high
apartment rents. The left has cried "Wolf!" so many times that
sensible people have learned to discount such claims.

 But now a bona fide wolf has arrived, whose predatory behavior is
doing terrible damage to our most populous state =01* and nobody will
believe it.

 True, California would be heading for a summer of power shortages
even if it had never deregulated. And even if there was workable
competition in the wholesale electricity market, prices in that
market would spike during periods of peak demand, transferring
billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the
generators.

 But the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn't workable
competition in California's power market, and that the actions of
generators "gaming the system" have greatly magnified the crisis.
The key fact is that California has somehow remained in a state of
more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale
prices regardless of the level of demand. A rash of outages has
kept the electricity market conveniently =01* and very profitably =01*
short of supply even during periods of low demand, when there ought
to be lots of excess capacity.

 As Frank Wolak, the Stanford economist who also advises the
state's power grid, has pointed out, an outage at a power plant is
a lot like an employee calling in sick. You can't tell directly
whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for
other reasons, but you can look for circumstantial evidence. And
such evidence has convinced Mr. Wolak that "generators use forced
outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market" =01* a
view shared by a growing number of other researchers.

 Which brings us to the latest move by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. On Wednesday, the commission apparently
decided to offer California some relief, and put new price caps in
place on the California electricity market. I say "apparently"
because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to
be any help at all. Indeed, the measure was passed on a 2-to-1
vote, with William Massey =01* the one commissioner who has been
sympathetic to calls for price controls =01* voting against it on the
grounds that it would be ineffectual.

 What's wrong with FERC's plan? First, it caps prices only in
emergency conditions =01* ignoring the fact that electricity prices
have stayed at hard- to-explain levels even when there is no
emergency. In effect, the plan is laid out as if the electricity
market were really competitive, in spite of all the evidence that
it is not.

 Second, even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes,
offering extensive opportunities for what Mr. Wolak calls "megawatt
laundering" =01* selling power to affiliated companies that for one
reason or another are exempted from the price controls (for
example, the controls do not apply to "imports" from neighboring
states), then selling it back into the California market. Severin
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute adds
that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at
the least efficient plant, generators will have a clear incentive
to produce inefficiently: "I predict we will find some plants we
never heard of before that are suddenly operating again, and they
will be pretty inefficient."

 The general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan.
There are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there =01*
indeed, last fall Mr. Wolak submitted a proposal that was well
received by other experts =01* but FERC has ignored all of them.

 The charitable interpretation is that FERC still doesn't get it,
that it just can't bring itself to believe that this time the wolf
is real. The uncharitable interpretation is that last week's action
was meant to fail. The Medley Report, an online newsletter, calls
the FERC plan "a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .
. a very clever temporary move by the Bush administration to
deflect any political fallout" from the looming disaster.

 Whatever the explanation, the plain fact is that FERC and the
administration have yet to offer California any significant
relief.

AURORA Version 5.2
-The fastest model just got faster-


 EPIS Announces the release of AURORA, version 5.2

 AURORA the electric market price forecasting tool is already
legendary for power and speed.  We've combined a powerful chronological
dispatch  model with the capability to simulate the market from 1
day to 25+ years.  Add to that a Risk Analysis section, powered by user
selectable Monte  Carlo &/or Latin Hypercube modeling, enough
Portfolio Analysis power to please the toughest critic, & inputs and
outputs from standard EXCEL &  ACCESS tables and you've got one of most
powerful tools in the market.

 Just a few months ago we expanded our emissions modeling
capabilities, added our quarterly database update, increased the speed
of the entire  model, and made

 But that wasn't enough.

 We've done it again.  Some of the operations that we've
included...
    Two new reporting enhancements.
     The first is marginal reporting
for fuels, resources and groups of resources.
     The second is the ability to
display resource stack information in graphical and dispatch order form.


 Other enhancements include dual fuel modeling, improved
transmission modeling, greater access to hourly results, and the ability
to model  monthly emission rates.  Moreover, the databases for
Central and Eastern, Texas, and Western markets have been updated to use
the new  modeling capabilities.

 We continue to make AURORA easier to use.  This version enhances
user control over modeling, editing inputs, and viewing of AURORA
output.   Clients desiring to exploit the power of AURORA now have
greater control over the inputs and outputs through VB Scripting in
AURORA.  The new  "update data" capability provides a means to
universally change any data element.

 Attached is more information on the fastest and most flexible
tool of its kind.

Please do not hesitate to contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh 
(x39510) with additional questions.

Executive Summary
An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of 
long-term contracts (price and term).
The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan 
to 1) pass on "court ordered rate increases" and 2) issue revenue bonds.
Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred 
to parent companies.  Davis is expected to use the threat of "endless 
appeals" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the 
pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt, as well 
as to limit the scope of the rate hikes.
Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him 
with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California 
consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy.
Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups.  If there is a 
ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected court-ordered rate 
hikes, it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state.

Legislation and Bail Out
Bill AB1X was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations 
yesterday.  Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure, 
specifically for communities that have harsh climates.  However, the bill has 
received support from almost everyone including consumer groups.   The bill 
is expected to pass sometime today.  Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance said 
Davis supports all the provisions in AB1X and expected to sign.  

Bill AB18X was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear 
today.  In committee hearings Monday, the DWR testified it is spent all of 
the $400M and were spending $45M/day in the spot market to buy power.

According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis, the on-going court 
battle, as discussed below, is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a 
settlement.  Davis recognizes that 1) the expected court ruling in the CPUC 
case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to 
California rate payers; 2) despite that ruling, the state government has the 
ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the 
two utilities unless they come to terms.  Thus, Davis believes that 
California consumers cannot avoid getting  hit with higher electricity 
charges, but he plans to use the threat of an appeal (and a possible ballot 
initiative) to limit the amount of the rate hikes.  

A plan to exempt the lowest income, smallest consumers from any rate increase 
and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130% of a baseline 
usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento.  That would 
still hit about one half of all consumers (since the "baseline" is set at 60% 
of average consumption), but it is "progressive" in a politically important 
sense. 

Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night 
when PG&E admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many 
customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates.   
The company's defense (they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash) was 
met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation 
policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious 
efforts by Californians to use less electricity.   "Every time you think 
there's a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves, 
something like this happens," one legislator moaned.

Long-Term Contracts

A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the 
negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long-term power buying 
contracts Davis initiated earlier this month.  The first wave of those 
contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be 
surprisingly positive, according to officials in the talks.  "We got a series 
of good offers in those initial proposals.   And some not so good ones," one 
official told our source.   "The idea is to announce the results of the first 
contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say, 
'you want in on this with these terms?'   We think we'll eventually shake 
loose a lot of supply with this strategy."

Bankruptcy

Because of these new dynamics, there is improved market confidence that 
California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for 
SoCal Edison and PG&E, even as they are set to miss another round of payments 
to creditors and suppliers today (remember, there is a standstill agreement 
among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb. 13).

We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost 
by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los 
Angeles, which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for 
elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week, at 
the latest.  In fact, without that political cover it would be impossible to 
square all the various circles of this crisis. 

Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives
Markets, Bush administration officials, and perhaps utility companies 
themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will 
launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200l to bring all 
electricity generation back under state control.  The threat of a proposition 
initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the 
California Public Utilities Commission released in the last 48 hours 
confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since 
mid-January.  First, the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that $2 billion of 
the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to 
itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells 
power.  Second, it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly $5 billion in 
profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its 
stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even 
while it was going on a debt-issuing binge. 

The audit of PG&E released late last night was even more damaging: PG&E 
management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to 
"clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis" by not making deep 
spending cuts, "including scaling back management salaries."  The auditors 
also questioned the utility's decision to funnel some $4.7 billion of its 
profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company, 
which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks.  
"Basically, they took the money and ran," as State Senate Speaker Burton put 
it yesterday.

What appears to be Governor Gray Davis' grudging acceptance of reality is 
actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough 
rate hikes/taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without 
triggering a new -- and far more damaging -- burst of populist outrage among 
a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making 
this all up.  There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and 
the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the 
spirit of the 1996 deregulation law, but that is irrelevant in popular 
political terms.  Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by 
the court case discussed below, these audits would make settlement extremely 
difficult.

Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key 
to understanding the very complex game that Davis, his advisers and senior 
legislators are now playing.   A ballot initiative would be a potential 
disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re-establishing full 
public control over the electric utilities.  Even if the state and utilities 
successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before 
that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during 
that prolonged period.   That's something California cannot afford as 
businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate. 

Court Battle
Thus, legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of 
the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PG&E are likely to win in 
mid-February.  The court will most likely grant the two utilities $12.7 
billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders 
of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30%, California politicians 
could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start 
of this extended drama: political cover. Davis will then have to rely on his 
political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the 
utilities to pass on something less than the full $12.7 billion debt.

PG&E and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed 
to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they 
have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them 
raise prices even as electricity prices soared.  The court said the 1996 
deregulation law was crystal clear -- when the two utilities had repaid 
so-called "stranded costs," they were free to begin charging whatever they 
needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power. 

Although the utilities won this case, the Judge stayed his order until 
February 14th at the state government's request.  As that deadline 
approaches, an intense new negotiating round is under way.  On the one hand, 
political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher 
electric prices ("the courts made me do it"), but on the other hand, they 
also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would 
force electricity rates up by about 40% on top of natural gas bills that have 
soared by about 300% since last year.  Utility companies are playing this 
card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final 
bailout.  "We'll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in 
mid-February then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and 
easily."

One tactic the state political officials are using, in order to force a 
settlement, is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the 
next couple of years.  One political official pointed out that they could 
keep the utilities from receiving their money this year, next year or perhaps 
even the year after. "Sure, we tell them, they will probably win in court and 
get that money.  Eventually.  We are making them well aware that unless we 
have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme 
Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least.  We don't think 
the creditors will be quite that patient."

I have a number of case studies on Enron but not the one on Sutton Bridge.
I know that Peter Tufano was working on it  but when  I checked the HBS
site and tried to purchase it, I could not locate it. 

When I talked to Peter a few months ago, he told me that the case study was 
ready
 and he  was going through Enron's internal approvals.

I cc Mark Palmer on it. Maybe he knows about this specific case study.

I wander if it was completed, given Sutton Bridge developments.

Executive Summary
? Davis might concede to rate hikes for future power consumption but not for 
past utility debt
? Davis and PG&E negotiations at a standstill, sticking point is net short 
for PG&E this summer 
? As the days go on with no word of a secured deal, involuntary bankruptcy 
chances increase significantly among small generators and QFs
? FERC would probably approve transmission deal but with several conditions 
for California

California Public Utility Commission Rate Increases 
Today may be the turning point as the CA PUC reviews the size of the 
Department of Water Resources  (DWR) rate increase to be passed along to 
consumers on their electricity bills.  Until now, Davis has considered rate 
hikes to be political suicide, but there may be some relief for him from 
consumer groups.   Sources indicate that one of California's main consumer 
advocate leaders may tolerate rate increases for future power consumption, 
but remains adamant about not raising rates to cover past utility debt.  DWR, 
which is currently buying power on behalf of the state, needs more income to 
securitize the planned $10B bond issue that is key part of Davis' plan to 
sign long term power contracts.  As DWR continues to spend $40 to $60 M every 
day on power purchases, a well placed source informed us the DWR is 
essentially bankrupt.  It currently has no money for normal activities such 
as ordering supplies, purchasing new equipment, etc.  The Department of 
Finance is forwarding DWR money from where ever it can (parks, other 
programs) to purchase power, but DWR's hands are tied until revenue bonds are 
issued.  The California State Treasurer Phil Angelides will be submitting a 
recommendation on rate increases in order to secure revenue and cover $10 
billion worth of state bonds. 

Davis & PG&E at Odds 
Sources report that Davis and PG&E negotiations are facing two difficult 
challenges: 1) PG&E wants 2.9 times book, which is far more than consumer 
groups recommend for the sale of its transmission lines (SCE accepted 2.3), 
and 2) PG&E needs relief from Davis for PG&Es legal responsibility to be the 
ultimate power purchaser for the state, and at this point Davis wants to 
limit further state energy power purchases (especially for summer).  The 
utilities refuse to sign a deal which will leave them billions of dollars 
further in the red ($3 to $4 B) and PG&E may declare bankruptcy for their 
utility subsidiary if Davis tries to force the issue.  Additionally, Davis is 
being hounded by the press and Harvey Rosenfield to publish details of the 
states' 40 long-term power contracts; a measure that if accomplished would 
provide Davis with even less negotiating power.

With all this activity, Davis is starting to lose support in the state 
legislature.  Sources report increasing tension between the Governor and 
State Senate President Pro-tem John Burton.  Burton has just announced a 
special Senate Committee will investigate the generators for evidence of 
price manipulation, and the State Auditor is also planning an investigation.  
Davis increasingly realizes he has to protect any deal he signs against being 
picked apart by the legislature and consumer groups later.

QF's Most Likely Source of Involuntary Bankruptcy
Sacramento insiders fear that a group of small generators will lose patience 
and force bankruptcy on the utilities.  SB 47X may have been California's 
Qualified Facilities last hope at avoiding an involuntary bankruptcy filing 
against PG&E, SoCal Ed, and SDG&E.  The bill designed to cut the QF's costs 
and provide them with a better rate structure is being held up in the State's 
senate.  Sources indicate that a filing could come at anytime and further 
investigations are underway to ferret out the most likely candidates.

Out with Hebert, In with Wood
The Bush administration favors replacing Hebert, Jr. with Texas PUC head Pat 
Wood.  There is an intense battle behind the scenes between Senate Republican 
Leader Trent Lott , who favors Hebert, and President Bush, who wants Wood.  
The administration would prefer Wood because they do not want FERC to pick a 
fight with Davis which means Bush might ultimately lose some western states 
in 2004.  In effort to tone down the recent press reports, Hebert has made 
several token concessions to California, including $69 million worth of power 
refunds and streamlining the federal permitting process for pipeline and 
power plant installation.  

It's is expected that FERC would most likely approve any transmission deal 
that Davis could complete but with a list of conditions.  Some conditions 
might include bring the lines formally into the regional grid system as well 
as other elements to pave the way for more dramatic Administrative actions in 
the West next year.  The Bush Administration is opposed to price caps and 
believes in free market solutions.  The Administration is also considering 
whether it might be a good idea to privatize Federally-owned assets such as 
BPA.

Just some of George Gail's observations:

He expects WTI crude prices to return to a range of $19-$22/barrel by 2Q 2000 
(Brent $18-$20) although emotions rather than fundamentals will continue to 
drive the market.
Saudi's sold Cal 00 naphtha at $8 M/T over the Platt's AG mean and the 
Kuwaiti's are offer their naphtha at $11 M/T over the mean. 
ENOC offered 700,000 tons of term naphtha and only sold 200,000 tons.
ADNOC's splitters should add even more naphtha supplies to the market.
Koch has closed their Rotterdam splitter due to poor economics. Not 
necessarily a permanent shutdown.
He expects the Brent/Dubai spread to return to more normal $1-$1.25/barrel.
Regarding condensate he predicts that actual demand will drive the market and 
there will be less bottomfeeding by the Japanese and other refiners. He does 
feel         the new splitters will reduce the worldwide volumes available, 
but that there will still be adequate supplies. 
He thinks crack spreads for refiners will still be weak during Cal 00.
Although some resid demand will be displaced by natural gas or LNG, he 
expects fairly stable differentials to crude.
He expects strong US gasoline demand, but limits his demand growth projection 
to 1% for the year.

Zhiyang and Zhiyun,

Vince told me that London has some trouble to calculate spread option
for correl=1, vol1=vol2.  In such a case, the effective volatility becomes
zero, and the option has zero time value.   

I have modified the UnitCorrPremium() routine to force the code to treat 
this situation as a special case. (It returns the discounted intrinsic value).

Please incorporate this chang to your code so that it will no longer cause 
any 
problems that should not happen in the first place. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Vince,

 I spoke with Susan Wood, who heads up our emissions marketing effort who 
says we don't really have any materials we send out. She did recommend the 
Emissions trading handbook which can be purchased for $50 from 
http://www.etei.org/handbook_changed.htm. 

 In general, the site http://www.etei.org/ is a great source of info, and the 
the parent site, http://www.emissions.org should be checked out as well. If 
you'd like me to purchase the handbook (it will take three weeks) let me know.

FYI  -   US inflation-linked bond

I can not replicate the nominal yield and inflation adjected cash flow
calculation from Bloomberg. So I called the bond analytics group.
I got to the point that they admit that they have made mistakes in their
calculation, and promised to fix it. 

Once I got the issues settled, there will be a better US inflation model.

Brad,

I was extreamly busy yesterday.  Sorry for answing your question till now.

Although I am not exactly sure how  the system handle gamma, this is what I=
=20
think the system is doing:


Curve shift =3D today's price - yesterady's price

P/L due to curve shift =3D today's market value using today's price curve (=
with=20
everything esle the same as yesterday's) - yesterday's market value using=
=20
yesterday's price curve.

So P/L due to curve shift contains both delta and gamma and higher order=20
terms.
We then use theoretical gamma (meaning option model gamma: 0.5*gamma * (pri=
ce=20
change)2 ) for gamma contribution and?define delta =3D curve shift - theore=
tical gamma.??Therefore, the gamma may not be very accurate to explain the =
delta change, ?especially when you have big price change due to higher orde=
r contribution. ??Let me know your thoughts on this.???Best wishes,??Zimin?=

I will keep runing my AGA model (the molecule model) for awhile.  For the last
two weeks the numbers that came out from the model are in the lucky side.
See the following table. 



The following figures shows the overall fit.

Anjam,

Here is the model for fitting the term structure of UK gilts.
The basic idea is as follows:

dirty price_{ith gilt} = Sum_{j} C_{i}/2*discount factor(t_{j,i} )+ 
100*discount factor(t_{Ni, i}

Using a five parameters analytical form for the discount factors, and 
minimizing the sum of
absolute errors, I can derive a smooth zero curve.   The model needs an 
initial guess
for the parameters, this may require some experience. The log file can help 
you to see
how well the optimization works.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

RiskBrief issue 4
>From FinanceWise: the only dedicated financial search engine
============================================================
22 March 2000

Dear RiskBrief subscribers

The fourth edition is here, and this month's theme is weather.
Weather derivatives is increasingly a hot topic on the web at the
moment. Four sites have been launched in the last three months,
including tradeweather.com, weather-risk.com and WeatherRiskAdvisory.com.
Along with the weather trading site from Liffe (I-WeX.com),
launched in January, and the introduction last September of
weather futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), there is
something of a rush on.

To provide you with an online resource to weather risk, we have
an introductory guide, two site reviews, 22 articles and an
exclusive book offer.

http://www.tradeweather.com (see site reviews)
http://www.weather-risk.com (see site reviews)
http://www.WeatherRiskAdvisory.com
http://www.i-wex.com
http://www.cme.com/news/weather921.html

How fast will the weather derivatives market grow? Will there be
enough liquidity? Let us know what you think.

In the meantime, please enjoy the rest of this month's issue,
with 14 articles on currency trading, e-trading, and news of conferences,
jobs and more.

Hi Karolina,

Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time 
difference, why don't we plan on tomorrow (Friday) 8:00AM PDT, 4:00PM BDT?  
My number in the states is 503-464-8430.  Give me your number, too, so that I 
can call back if I get hung up in a meeting or something.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the 
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but 
in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout 
the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why 
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for 
the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each 
plant's aggregate values are reported.

I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a 
Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL 
query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making 
appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood 
documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I 
can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine 
at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation, 
so it may be available now.

Let's talk and maybe we can help you out,
Michael

>>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>>
Michael,

I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I 
am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and 
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard 
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and 
consequently the person to contact in case of problems.

I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide 
the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the 
numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack 
and system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each 
station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though, 
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea 
Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations 
according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station 
Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:

For each hour, for each generating station:

"marginal cost" [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] - 
VOM_cost [o/MWh]

This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a 
marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above 
calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea 
Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and 
TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.

Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which 
outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?

It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case 
could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling 
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

Regards

Karolina

Executive Summary
Discussions continue today over bill AB1X, focus will be on price and term.
New legislation introduced today whereby the state will try to save the 
utilities from bankruptcy by taking ownership of utilities' hydro assets in 
exchange for rate increases.
Wednesday, state receives bids from auction, rate ranges are expected to be 
between 5.5 and 8.0 cents per kilowatt hour.
Mid week, audit  findings will be released; audit expected to show PG&E's 
utility subsidiary handed over $5B to the holding company. The holding 
company used $4.4B to pay shareholder dividends and buyback stock.
State commissioned study to see who would benefit more in a possible 
bankruptcy scenario.  Bankruptcy still very possible for both 
      companies.
Davis concerned about possible ballot issues and how those may effect futue 
solutions or "bail out".

Legislation
There will be continued discussion regarding bill AB1X in the Senate today.  
The discussion will focus on the rate cap of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour as 
well as the term.  Assemblyman Keeley, the author, indicated that he believed 
5.5 cents was "a fantasy" and impossible to obtain. 

Today, Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks and Assemblyman Fred 
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek will introduce legislation whereby the state
would temporary or permanently take both PG&E and Edision's hydroelectric 
facilities or transmission lines (or both) in exchange for keeping the 
utilities out of 
bankruptcy.  The state would allow PG&E and Edison to impose rate increases, 
however, the rates would not rise beyond the hikes approved earlier this 
month by the CPUC as an emergency surcharge.  The money collected from 
consumers would go toward paying off their current debt and the state 
would then enter into long-term contracts with power generators.  Under the 
bill, the state of California would control 10% of all California's 
electricity.  As you 
can imagine, this legislation has not received unanimous praise.  According 
to recent corporate filings, PG&E's hydroelectric plants alone would be 
valued 
between $3 and $5 billion.  This amount just happens to be what Davis 
estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee 
once 
the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is 
escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $12 billion in debt.  
Davis 
is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help 
with about $4 billion in debt, while the utilities, of course, say the full 
$12 billion should 
be covered. 

On Wednesday, state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy 
suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their 
effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come.  Davis 
insists there are already several bids for his 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour 
ceiling, though few 
agree with his opinion.  A handful of smaller, independent electricity 
providers with about a 30% share of California power market, indicated Sunday 
night they would come down to "less than eight cents" or less than half of 
what they currently charge, in return for the stability of long term 
contracts.  Because 
consumers pay about 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current 
PUC rules, any hope California has to "work off" the back debts for these 
utilities lies 
in hitting something very close to Davis' price cap, without falling back on 
higher prices for consumers.  The level of bids will be particularly 
important since bond
rating agencies moved to put the state of California on a Credit watch on 
Friday, worried that there was no obvious long-term repayment plan for the 
billions of 
dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state.

Utility's Audit
By the middle of this week, California auditors will release their findings 
about how much money PG&E and SoCal Edison actually owe to institutions 
outside their own holding company structure. This will define the limits of 
what the state will guarantee, if they guarantee any of the debt. The truly 
explosive 
part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of 
dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years.  A  
source with
knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last 
three years, PG&E's utility subsidiary handed over about $5 billion to the 
holding 
company. Of that total, the holding company used $4.4 billion to pay 
shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock. 

Another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current 
power crisis when regulators, at the time of deregulation (under the 
direction of 
Former R-Gov. Pete Wilson), forced the two utilities to sell at least half of 
their power-generating plants.  Auditors are expected to say that if the 
utilities 
still owned all these plants, electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt 
hour, compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in December and January.

Bankruptcy
The threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities.  Senior 
advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility 
companies that 
ended in bankruptcy.  As all the parties involved hunker down for another 
intensely political week, they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy, but 
to push 
this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an 
advantage.  Under such conditions, the risks of one or more of the players 
fumbling and
triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy, is still quite high. 
 
California's political leaders order a series of independent analyses to 
determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy, the state or the two 
utilities.
The short answer was that no one has any idea.  Below are the findings of the 
report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge:

1) Would the companies be eligible for Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy? 
Some of the advisors thought that PG&E and Edison's finances were so 
bad that Chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option.  
Advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate 
debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the 
companies into full liquidation.   This would most certainly be guaranteed 
chaos.
2) Could the bankruptcy court actually force the PUC to raise the price of 
electricity to consumers? The legal basis for passing on rate increases to 
consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought, particularly if there 
is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies.   And 
there is still the 
question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge.
3) If the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets 
seriously and finds that PG&E and Edison cannot afford to buy electricity, 
he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages.
4) If the utilities go into bankruptcy, the first creditors in line would be 
the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges.  The state could become 
almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier  
(one of the reasons why suppliers won't sell electricity on credit to these 
companies now).
5) If the two companies went bankrupt, it would be the largest bankruptcies 
in history, straining just about everyone involved in the process.
6) The corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets 
from the utility by the FERC for PG&E and already in place for Edison 
may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies 
currently think. This is particularly true if this week's audit shows the two 
corporations transferring 
billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder 
dividend payments.

Davis
Opinion polls show that Governor Gray Davis is getting high marks for his 
job, and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits.  One of Davis 
concern's is, according to a senior official in the Governor's office, that a 
deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so 
anti-utility and 
anti-business that it cripples future growth in the state.  According to a 
senior official, "No one thought Howard Jarvis and his property tax 
initiative would 
succeed in destroying our education system, but he did, with one just ballot 
line and a lot of popular revulsion. The threat of direct, popular action
is at least as large now as then."  Consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield is 
already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that 
individual 
electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay 
their debt through higher rate-payer bills.  This official goes on to say, 
"The 
anger at utility companies is so high here, that almost anything Rosenfield 
could think of would pass and we couldn't do anything about it."  This threat 
has 
begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always 
appeared wide open to political leaders -- floating a bond issue or a 
guarantee 
for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure, 
and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next 
several years.

Zhiyang,

Got your message.  

As we discussed, the best way to breakdown the big correlation matrix between 
different location indices is through "cluster analysis".  The idea is to select major
hubs and the "satellite" markets.  By establish the correlation between the hubs
and correlation between the satellites and the hubs, the big matrix can be significantly
reduced.    Then the traders only need to input the correlations between the hubs.

This technique has been applied in our Value at Risk system.  You may talk to 
Tanya to find out the details.

Mark,

After recently reviewing the booking of the P+ options, it is my understanding that these options are being valued using a standard spread option model where the price evolution of the two legs of the spread are assumed to be correlated Geometric Brownian Motion processes  (i.e. the price process assumptions are consistent with standard Black-76 model assumptions extended to two commodities).  

The payoff for a call option is:

Payoff	= Max( 0,  A - B - K).

Where:
	A = NXWTI (delivery price for Nymex)
	B = Posting Price = (WTI Swap) - (Posting Basis)
	K= Posting Bonus (fixed).

The only complication of this option as compared to most other spread options is that leg "B" of the spread is a combination of three prices,  the two futures prices which make up the WTI swap for the given month, and the average posting basis during the delivery month.   Combination of these prices is easily addressed by simply setting the volatility of leg "B" and the correlation to correctly account for the volatility of this basket of prices and its correlation with the NXWTI price.  I believe that this approach is more straightforward than the alternative, which would be to use a three or four-commodity model with its associated volatility and correlation matrices.

In summary, I believe that this is an appropriate model for valuation of these types of options, assuming that the inputs are set correctly.

Regards,

Stinson Gibner

Hi Vince,

I am enclosing a report on my thoughts about risk and return behaviour of an  
insurance portfolio. Your input on this will be very helpful. 

I have given Vasant a copy of this report and am working with him towards 
improving  this. In the mean time, I happened to mention this idea in a 
meeting with David  Porter, Per Sekse, Brad Blesie and David Hoog and there 
seems to be some  interest in understanding how this works. In fact, David 
Hoog subsequently  reviewed this with me and suggested some changes. Those 
changes have been included in this report.

The idea here is simple and just a starting point.  While it provides a broad 
picture on how risk and return will behave at portfolio level,  I am hoping 
to be able to relax some of the assumptions to get more realistic picture in 
near future.

Looking forward to your input,

Sincerely,

Amitava

The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please treat with discretion.

Executive Summary:
?	FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives. Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new power generation
?	Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of out-of-state generators
?	June 1st "kill clause" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional plan
?	California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected $20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper Administration involvement
?	QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court
?	New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling
?	Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout deal

1.	FERC Fallout
The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the construction of new generation.

It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who favors price caps actually voted against this plan. 

2.	Something Less than Effective Price Caps
 From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws:
?	The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west. Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to California.
?	As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power than a ceiling.
?	State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2 emergency and does not require any collusion.
?	Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.

3.	Proposal "Kill Clause" Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis
The FERC proposal includes a "kill clause" that says the caps will be withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines blaming him for letting the "Bush price caps plan" collapse.

4.	Growing Fiscal Risk in California
Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take further action to control prices for  power.

The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about 90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.  The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge loans they are providing to California.

The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating deficits in a matter of months.

5.	QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E
Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts, since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the  QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw  of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.
 
6	Delays Likely in New QF Generation
The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.

7.	Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan
Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a  utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a "non-bypassable" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge.  

8.	Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts
The issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.  Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will challenged, creating an even further delay.

Margaret, 

Please find attached file with average monthly prices for regions your 
requested. This file gives more information than the previous (yesterday) 
one. As the one before, source for this file is Megawatt daily, it includes 
On-Peak and Off-Peak prices and you can also see daily data that was 
converted to monthly average data. There are two types of averages prices: 
average and weighted average. Weighted average takes into account number of 
transactions of certain price.

For example: PJM had average price of $53.61 and weighted average price of 
$53.15 in August , it means that there were more transactions of lower price 
than higher.  Also, Megawatt Daily has its own methodology and I am attaching 
it with this message. 

If you have any questions regarding prices or methodology, please contact 
Sevil Yaman (5-8083) or me (3-4305).

INSIDE WASHINGTON  =02=05 FEDERAL AFFAIRS

***FERC De-Federalizes California Markets, Adopts Other Structural Reforms*=
**

At a special meeting Friday afternoon, FERC unanimously approved its eagerl=
y=20
awaited final order reforming the California wholesale markets, adopting th=
e=20
major outlines of its November 1 proposed order and sending back to=20
California the responsibility for addressing state-related matters.  At the=
=20
same time, FERC deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well=
=20
as the imposition of region-wide price caps.  FERC reiterated their earlier=
=20
conclusions that under certain circumstances, California ratepayers were=20
subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to California's=20
"seriously flawed" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight=20
demand and supply conditions throughout the West.

FERC adopted the November proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, the=
=20
state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities buy=
=20
and sell electricity through the PX, and allow these utilities to purchase=
=20
electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to=
=20
manage supply risks.  FERC terminated the PX's rate schedules effective at=
=20
the close of business on April 30, 2001.  In effect, as Chairman James=20
Hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the California=20
wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning=
=20
ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission (CPUC).

The agency also modified the effective period of the $150/MWh "soft cap"=20
proposal, limiting its application through April 2001, whereupon a=20
"comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which=20
incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures" must b=
e=20
in place.  In a related move, FERC ordered a technical conference early nex=
t=20
year to develop such a program by March 1, 2001, so that these measures can=
=20
be place by the May 1, deadline.

***Energy Secretary Issues Order to Power Generators and Marketers To Bolst=
er=20
California's Supplies***

Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has responded to the severely constrained=
=20
power supply situation in California by issuing an order, pursuant to Secti=
on=20
202(c) of the Federal Power Act, to require generators and marketers to mak=
e=20
power available to meet the state's electricity needs.  The emergency=20
directive requires that, if the California independent system operator (ISO=
)=20
certifies that there is an inadequate supply of electricity, certain=20
suppliers would be required to make power available to the ISO if they have=
=20
power available in excess of the amount needed to satisfy service to firm=
=20
customers. Those suppliers that have provided power to the California power=
=20
exchange (PX) and the ISO over the last 30 days that have firm capacity=20
available would be subject to the order.

Under the order, the ISO is required to provide notice to each supplier=20
subject to the order of the amount and type of service requested by 9:00 pm=
=20
EST on the day before the requested service.  The ISO must, to the extent=
=20
feasible, allocate the requests in proportion to the amount of each=20
supplier's available power.  The price for the power provided pursuant to t=
he=20
order will be set by an agreement between the ISO and the supplier.  If no=
=20
agreement is reached, FERC is to determine the just and reasonable rate at =
a=20
later date.   The order will remain in effect until 3:00 am EST on December=
=20
21, 2000 unless modified.

***EPA Sets Plans to Regulate Plants' Mercury Emissions***

EPA Administrator Carol Browner, in a long-awaited announcement, indicated=
=20
last week that the Administration will require reductions of mercury=20
emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants.  The agency stated that it=
=20
plans to propose new regulations in December 2003, and hopes to finalize ne=
w=20
rules by December 2004.

In the wake of the decision, EEI called on EPA to make certain that any=20
program to control utilities' mercury emissions be based on the best=20
scientific information available in order to assure the protection of publi=
c=20
health.  "EEI urges EPA to maintain its commitment to resolving the key=20
scientific and technological issues," said Paul Bailey, EEI Vice President,=
=20
Environmental Affairs.  Given these uncertainties, EEI is disappointed that=
=20
the regulatory determination includes statements regarding public health=20
threats and hazards that are unsupported by current science," said Mr. Bail=
ey.

"In the meantime, the electric power industry will continue to work with al=
l=20
stakeholders to determine the extent to which additional mercury reductions=
=20
from power plants may be needed, and how those cuts should be achieved," Mr=
.=20
Bailey concluded.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

Did you guys get this?

I was too interested in the conversation to interrupt with comments about
risk/return & valuation of assets for utilities.  I thought I would mention to
you, however, that when decisions are quantified, utilities usually use
classical decision analysis, i.e., von Neuman utility curves.  If the decision
is for unregulated assets or impacts shareholders directly, it is the
President's curve; if the decision would be covered in rates, it is the
customers' curves or equivalently the PUC's curve.

I think if I were going to approach valuation in commodities where the
assumptions of Black/Scholes do not apply, I would start with the CAPM for
large industries in an area, use pro formas to translate this to utility
curves for the input commodities, and add the utility curves.

Another issue:  The factor that explains why Enron is lowest bidder is its
role in the market.  In the 1930s, Keynes argued that if most market
participants with long position were hedgers, futures prices would be higher
than spot; if they were speculators or traders, future prices would be lower
than spot.  Traders must be compensated for holding the risk; hedgers
(including utilities and consumers) are willing to pay a premium for the
certainty.  Consequently, Enron traders have bigger bid/ask spreads and lower
bid prices.

Just some random thoughts,
Michael

I have written a C++ code to do the following: For a given curve,
the code will filter out the seasonal factor.  It then fits the deseasoned
curve to a smooth function of the form  f(t)=a+A/(t+B)c, with 0<c<.5. ?The curve fitting is achieved by using Conjugate Gradient method. ??As Tanya pointed out, this form of function ensures that  ?f(t)2*t - f(t-1)2*(t-1) >0, which is useful in calculating forward-forward ?vol. ?The outputs are season patterns (2 different patterns are allowed)?and the smoothed curve.  One can then calculate forward-forward vol?from the smoothed curve and superimpose the seasonal factors back?onto the curve.??This procedure is not useful for VaR calcuation. However, I believe it ?is useful for other situations which require the knowledge of  seasonal ?forward-forward vols.  For example, in power plant valuation and?credit exposure simulations, it would reflect the reality more closely?if we add seasonality to our forward-forward vol in simulating the forward?prices. ??Attached are the spreadsheet and XLL file. I will forward the C code if?any of you is interested. ??Alex??

Stinson,

I have created a directory (O:\research\common\projects\options\McLib)
to hold our Monte-Carlo models we developed in the past. 

I have the following MC models:

1. Asian option with two-point vol structure
2. Asian barrier option
3. Asian spread option
4. Time spread option
5. Asian Digital option

Do we want to include models using American Monte-Carlo ?
I have 

1. American Spread Option
2. Option on Min or Max of  n assets with n as an input
3. Omicron option model with 3 price processes

I suggest that all of us save a copy of Monte-Carlo models in this directory, 
from these,
we can build a general Monte-Carlo library.  We can also calculate the MC 
Greeks more
efficiently now.

Eugene,

Bob and I had a discussion about your question you raised yesterday.

For an option writer, he has the obligation to deliver, so he hedges it with 
the underlying by adjesting delta positions.  The hedging cost, theoretically,
should be equal to the fair value of the option premium. 

On the other hand, for the option holder, he has no obligation, by delta 
heging,
he would pay double for the option, with no upside.  So he should not hedge 
it at all.

If the option holder wants to protect the time value of the option, he should 
sell 
the option to the market or some equivalent options to create a theta-neutral 
portfolio.
This may require trading in both the orginal and the equivalent option 
underlyings.  

Our question to you, if the call options you mentioned are embedded in the 
EES 
contracts, say fixed price sale contracts, What makes it possible to just 
separate those options
and sell them to the market to retain the full values of the options ?  We 
conjecture that these
 options are meant to hedge the original contract. By selling those options 
you eliminate the upside of the
 original contract.

Give one of us a call if you want to discuss this further.

Zimin

Vince,

As a followup to our meeting with David Port and Rudi Zipter re Enron's investment in SK-Enron, Maureen and I wrote the attached position paper on the Japanese Yen.  As we have discussed, the volatility of the won closely tracks fluctuation in the yen, and this yen position paper is intended to complement the won outlook piece for a broader perspective on currencies that takes into account the yen's influence on asian currencies. .  

We would like to distribute this outlook to David and Rudi, but wanted to send it to you for initial reaction prior to internal distribution.

Thank you, and let me know if you have any questions or comments re the attached.

Gwyn

FTR team,

The copy of the auction results that you got at yesterday's meeting is 
incorrect. What happened was when I tried to sort the entire page, I only 
highlighted the related column and expected Excel 98 would sort the whole 
page. (As Steve told me before, I should highlight the whole thing if I try 
to do sorting in Excel). I appolized for the misleading and have redone the 
whole thing.  Thanks for the patience. Wish you all have a great weekend.

I had a meeting with Willis (Insurance Broker) today and they advised that 
they have a computer analytics tool that can evaluate traditional exposures 
and express the risk as VAR.  Would you be interested in seeing the tool?

Vince - attached is the most recent E&P version of the old corporate cash 
flow model that I could find.  Note that "most recent" still dates it back a 
few years.  A couple caveats:  I did try to clean it up somewhat from old 
macros, but no guarntees offered.  Also, some of the underlying methodology 
is not what we would probably currently use, such as for pricing, stochastic 
processes, and perhaps decline rates.  
Please let me know if I can provide any additional help.

John,

I think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and 
elimination of
risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages). Being 
aware of risk
does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.

Now a few more detailed comments.

1. I think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined 
with 
a project finance discount rate. Illiquidity discount, in my view,
should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without 
sufficient depth.
One should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time. The 
approach used in valuation
of the Turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of 
investments in physical
assets, which are by definition illiquid. This illiquidity  is recognized 
through other aspects
of valuation technology used in RAROC. 

If we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent 
and use
this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that 
I recommend this course of action).

2. Valuation of an unheadgable options.

Let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.

He cannot hedge a short call or put and Black-Scholes valuation becomes the 
floor for
the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as 
opposed to taking a vol
risk when he hedges). The issue of the compensation he will require becomes 
fuzzy.
The option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on 
two factors:

1. risk preference
2. existing portfolio positions

Risk preference. Insurance companies typically require a payment that 
consists of two parts:
expected loss + unexpected loss. The latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 
standard deviations.
The number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability 
to absorb the loss.
I admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works. We 
looked into insurance pricing at the
request of Jere Overdyke. You can talk to Vasant Shanbhogue to find out more 
about it.

Existing portfolio positions. An additional contract may increase or decrease 
the risk of the overall portfolio.
I would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not 
look to me as a deal that reduces risk
(given all our positions in this region).

What are the practical implications? Pricing depends on risk appetite (the 
utility function of a decision maker
in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary. 

If we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged,
we should subtract from the value of the contract
the value of the option (that is greater than the Black - Scholes value).
If we don't price this option explicitly,
the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk 
premium.

In the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed. If he cannot 
hedge, he should recognize the risk
of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of 
the option.
How big is the discount? See the comments above. 

In the special case, where hedging is possible and the Black-Scholes-Merton 
paradigm applies, both values
will become equal (ignoring transaction costs). The values of an option form 
the point of view of 
a seller and a buyer will converge.

3. What happens in case we use simulation technology?

We can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will 
recognize the downside and/or
upside at different points in time in different states of the world).
If we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of 
NPV as of today.
Knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases 
we are still holding
it. The expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk. This is 
equivalent to using a 
discount rate with a risk premium.

I hope this helps. Please, call me with additional questions. Sorry for a 
delay in responding
to this question. I ran my response by Stinson and Vasant, to make sure we 
all agree.
It's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not 
have
good answers.

 

Vince

Chonawee,

As I have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad 
decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects).

Suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an ATM option.
You  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares). The price goes to 
$100.  
You lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position. Option exercise 
gives you $30,000. This is before taxes. You pay taxes
on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income). The tax is
28% x $30,000 = $8,400. You can use only $3,000 of your loss against
ordinary income. This saves you only $840 in taxes. 

Of course, if you have capital gains, you can use losses on your option 
position
as an offset.

The remaining part of your capital loss  is carried forward and you get the
tax benefits over time (less the time value of money), assuming you have 
income in the
future (or capital gains).

Not so good.

By the way, valuation and optimal exercise of employee stock options
is a very interesting and difficult problem.

Vince

Subject: short-sell vs exercise

Below is my writing that was originally planned to post somewhere. It 
explains how to handle a special type of call options which can be exercised 
but cannot be sold. (As we know that it is never optimal to exercise a call 
option before its maturity). However, after taking Vince's comments on the 
ordinary income/capital loss TAX offsetting issue, I think this is not a good 
article anymore. I guess I could just throw this article away. :-)

Short-selling is better than exercising your employee stock options

In general, the sensible time to exercise your employee stock option is when 
you speculate that ENE is going down or its growth rate is extremely low. In 
fact, when exercising the options, you are speculating that ENE would never 
reach this point (plus interest) again during the 10 years maturity date or 
until you leave the company. If you do not anticipate that, you should hold 
on to your options because you can gain higher profit by delaying your 
exercise.

However, if you believe that ENE is reaching its peak. Then, instead of 
exercising the options, you should short-sell (or sell) the stocks in that 
amount. After short-selling, when you feel that the stock starts to go up, 
you can buy them back (to cover), make profit, and still keep the options. On 
the other hand, if the stock does not go down as expect, you can exercise the 
options to cover your short position anytime. 

Let us take a look at a simple case where there are no taxes, no dividends, 
and zero risk-free rate. Suppose that ENE follows a simple sample path as 
follow


If you exercise 100 ENE options with a grant price of 45 when ENE reaches 70, 
you would earn  (70-45)*100 = $2,500. But if you short sell 100 ENE at 70, no 
matter how much ENE is in the future, you can exercise the options to cover 
the short position and still earn (70-45)*100 = $2,500. The advantage of 
short-selling comes when ENE at the period 2 is 60. At this point, you can 
cover your short position, get (70-60)*100 = $1,000, and still keep your 
options or you can exercise the options and gain $2,500. That is, you still 
keep the flexibility of your options when you short-sell. In conclusion, the 
only sensible time to exercise your employee stock options is to cover your 
short position.

I was curious about the accuracy of our credit reserve model as a function of 
the
number of simulations we use. This question, I think, is not so important 
when we 
calculate credit reserve, because the assumptions underlying our model are 
pretty 
rough anyway (here I mean the assumptions regarding price processes, 
correlations, etc.)

This question becomes more essential when we talk about calculating 
sensitivities of the 
credit reserve to various factors. When the magnitude of the sensitivity is 
comparable
to the accuracy of calculation of the credit reserve, what is the accuracy of 
such sensitivity?
  
I performed a numerical experiment where I calculated the expected loss
for a simple portfolio with one counterparty (SITHE IND POWER) for different
number of simulations (10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000) using old research 
credit model.
You can see how the result converges and the relative error (compared to the 
result for 100000 simulations which is assumed to be the most accurate) in 
the 
attached file.

Tanya.

Subject: My model for spikes




Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I was recently allowed to release into the public domain on the limited basis
the first of the preprints that I recently authored on my model for spikes in
power prices and for the valuation of the contingent claims on power. In this
regard, I have just given a talk on this model at the joint seminar of the
Center for Energy Finance Education and Research and the Institute for
Computational Finance at the UT Austin. Right now I am also in the process of
forming a list of specialists both in the industry and academia who might be
interested in receiving this preprint. Please let me know if you might be
interested in receiving this preprint.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely yours,

Valery Kholodnyi
Manager of Quantitative Analysis
Research and Analytics Group
TXU Energy Trading

PS. Here are the main preprints that I have recently authored on my model for
spikes in power prices and valuation of contingent claims on power:

1. Valery A. Kholodnyi, The Stochastic Process for Power Prices with Spikes 
and
Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power, Preprint, TXU-RAG-01/00, 
July
2000.
2. Valery A. Khlolodnyi, Valuation of a Swing Option on Power with Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-05/00, August, 2000.
3. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Spark Spread Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-21/00, November 2000.
4. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of European Contingent Claims on Power at 
Two
Distinct Points on the Grid with Spikes in Both Power Prices, Preprint
TXU-RAG-24/00, November 2000.
5. Valery A. Kholodnyi, Valuation of a Transmission Option on Power with 
Spikes,
Preprint TXU-RAG-25/00, November 2000.

As I have indicated to you in my previous e-mail, contrary to the standard
approaches, I model spikes directly, as self-reversing jumps on top of a
stochastic process for the regular dynamics of power prices in the absence of
spikes. In this way the dynamics of power prices is modeled as a non-Markovian
process, even if the process for the regular dynamics of power prices is
Markovian. Among other things my model for spikes allows for the explicit
valuation and hedging of contingent claims on power with spikes, provided that
the corresponding contingent claims on power can be valued and hedged in the
absence of spikes.

I have included provision for providing rank correlation between "jump occurrence in daily average power price" and "outage occurrence".  The model will provide the same claim distribution as before when PriceVsOutage Correlation = 0 is used.  Claim goes up as the correlation is increased.  I have performed some sensitivity analysis and the results seem to make sense.  

The new model workbook is "OutagePricingModel040901.xls" and corresponding dll is "OutagePricing040901.dll", both located in O:\GRM\RESEARCH\OUTAGERISK\  subdirectory.  The price vs. outage rank correlation input will need to be provided in "MAIN" spreadsheet.  Please call me if you have any questions.

On March 16, Martin Lin will be participating in a panel discussion with Dick 
O'Neill of FERC, a rep. of Morgan Stanley, and Ed Cazalet of APX on "Market 
Turmoil, Trading and Risk Management" (Harvard Electricity Group).  At the 
present time, except in several limited regions, marketers do not have the 
ability to hedge transmission risk by reselling it above cost.  Last year, we 
approached Dick O'Neill's staff about the possibility of lifting the cap on 
resales of transmission, but they were not inclined to proceed absent the use 
of certain restrictions.  There have been several recent developments in 
power and gas, as discussed in the attached memo.  It would be helpful for 
Martin to discuss these recent orders as necessary in order to attempt to 
gain support from Dick O'Neill for the idea of lifting the cap for power.  
After Martin's discussion, we should consider reapproaching FERC to seek 
approval.

Executive Summary
? If no comprehensive deal is reached by April 9th, chances of bankruptcy 
increase due to a one day "opt-out" clause in all long-term power contracts. 
? PG&E and State locked in tough negotiations, several issues on the table:
 PUC-imposed requirement forcing PG&E to ultimately be responsible for 
California energy supplies
 Price of the grid; state - 2.3 times book value vs. PG&E - 4 times book value
? PG&E will not use any of the $1B secured last week to help their ailing 
utility.
? Davis's announcement of long term power contract didn't include some 
details:
 Of the 8,800 megawatts secured this far, only 6,000 are available this 
summer 
 Some of the "long term contracts" are really only for three months
 None of the contracts prevent California from buying peak demand on the spot 
market
? One the same day Davis announced long term contracts, Davis also quietly 
announce a 10% rate hike.
? FERC may be the wild card in approving this deal.
 
PG&E
Transmissions deal
One thing that is still uncertain is PG&E.  Bankruptcy may still be a likely 
alternative if current negotiations to buy PG&E's share of the electric 
transmission grid fail to produce a deal by April 9 (when all long-term power 
contracts being negotiated have a one-day "opt-out" clause they can exercise 
unilaterally if a "comprehensive solution" has not been reached by the state 
and its major utilities).  According to sources close to senior PG&E 
officials, PG&E made it clear that any hope for a politically acceptable deal 
on the transmission lines depends on the California government's willingness 
to make a major financial commitment it has been completely unwilling to make 
until now. 

PG&E will not make a final deal to sell its grid unless Davis agrees to 
relieve it of the PUC-imposed requirement to be the "electricity buyer of 
last resort."  Current state regulations make the utility companies 
ultimately responsible for generating or purchasing enough electricity at all 
times to supply California's energy needs.  As long as the state steps in and 
makes those purchases, as it has for the past three months, the utilities are 
shielded from absorbing the losses generated by paying premiums for spot 
market power and selling to consumers who are shielded by low rate ceilings.  
But, PG&E officials are worried 1) this summer's supply and 2) Davis's 
concern over how fast he is draining the state's budget surplus.  If things 
get into a crunch this summer and Davis makes a new decision that the state 
will pay only for the electricity it buys through long-term contracts, then 
PG&E will be left holding the bag. 

Thus, as part of the negotiations over buying the electricity grid, PG&E is 
demanding a "comprehensive solution" that includes not being liable for cost 
differentials between the spot market purchase and what consumers are allowed 
to pay.  State officials are in no mood to grant that kind of "get out of 
jail free" card, so the two sides remain locked in extremely tough 
negotiations that are complicated by three other factors: (1) PG&E's public 
behavior and welter of announcements in the past few days that seem to 
encourage suppliers to force involuntary bankruptcy; (2) State legislative 
demands that the price Davis negotiate for PG&E's part of the electricity 
grid be no more than 2.3 times revenues from the grid; and (3) the FERC must 
"positively approve" any grid purchase by the state of California. 

The principal concern on the price front is that PG&E wants to sell the 
electricity grid for nearly four times the estimated book value of their 
transmission, while consumer groups insist that two times book value is the 
politically acceptable limit.  "We see 2.3 times book value as an absolute 
upper bound. There is no way PG&E will get more than that, whatever they 
think," according to the leader of one main consumer groups.  "We are going 
to try to force any deals down to about 2.0 in any case." Negotiators for 
Davis are also trying to 'proposition-proof' any transmission deal to protect 
against a later ballot proposal.  They think there are ways to do that, but 
not if the price of PG&E's part of the grid triggers a ballot initiative.  
Remember, if Davis's eventual solution triggers a ballot initiative, he will 
be running for re-election on the same ballot as a public initiative designed 
to overturn his solution.

On the Sacramento front - no one understands PG&E's motives
The one question no one in Sacramento can figure out is what kind of game 
PG&E is playing.  In a three day period PG&E made a series of announcements 
that left everyone scratching their heads. 
? Late Thursday, PG&E officials leaked information to California papers that 
they had agreed in principle to sell their part of the electricity 
transmission grid to the state, which seemed like obvious good news, but then 
made it clear in discussions that the price they were asking was at least 30% 
above what the state was currently offering.  While a deal can still be done, 
anything like the $10 billion PG&E wants would be very hard to get through 
the California legislature which needs to approve any purchase. 
? Late Friday, PG&E officials announced that they had secured a $1 billion 
loan for the parent company (not the electricity utility) and would use the 
money to pay off bondholders, other creditors and to return $161 million to 
shareholders in a new dividend payout.  Not a cent of that money was 
earmarked to help the struggling electricity orphan of PG&E and that left at 
least one rating agency convinced that the company was more ready to send the 
utility into bankruptcy than had been previously understood. 
? Over the weekend, PG&E leaked a story claiming that it was willing to pay 
off its energy suppliers' debt for 15 cents on the dollar right now.  For 
generators who are having to make decisions each morning about whether to 
start legal actions that protect their rights in any eventual bankruptcy 
action or hold off on the assumption that the politics of this process will 
"make them whole" in a couple of months, that kind of trial balloon is 
extremely unnerving.

Thus, in a very short time period, PG&E's corporate owners showed they could 
access public credit markets with relative ease and then showed that they 
were unwilling to use these funds to smooth the way toward a solution to the 
energy crisis.  Davis has demanded that all of the major utilities absorb at 
least a part of the $13 billion debt they have accumulated since last summer 
and PG&E's fund-raising will harden and deepen those demands.  As one senior 
political official told our source "just when you think the corporate 
leadership of that company has insulted us as completely as possible, they 
come up with something even more outrageous." 

PG&E's actions also complicate the broader solution Davis is trying to 
construct to solve California's problems.  State Democrats doubt they will 
get Republican support for a deal, which means a vote will fall short of the 
two-thirds majority necessary for immediate enactment (resulting in 90 days 
for the legislation to go into effect).  Additionally, in the past 48 hours, 
many Sacramento sources have reported that forcing creditors to take a less 
in any debt payback is gaining substantial support with the legislators and 
may be crafted into any legislation to authorize Davis to purchase the 
electricity grid.

Long-term Contracts - Davis didn't tell the whole truth
Yesterday, Davis announced that he had signed "long-term" power deals for 
8,800 megawatts of power, out of a total 12,000 megawatts he wanted to sign 
eventually. According to the press release, Davis is now 75% of the way 
toward his long-term goal and has already solved the hardest part of 
California's energy crisis. This means consumers would maybe pay more than 
necessary five years from now, but these contracts "guaranteed" that 
consumers would pay less for the next three years.  What Davis failed to 
highlight was that of the 8,800 megawatt commitment, actually only 6,000 
megawatts are available this summer (when demand is expected to 45,000 
megawatts); and some of these "long-term contracts" are actually only good 
for three months.  None of these contracts, however, keep California from 
having to buy the most expensive peak demand electricity on the spot market.

Davis Agrees on New Consumer Electricity Rate Hikes for Next Year
While the media was concern with Davis's announcement of long term contracts 
for California, of less concern to the media was Davis's quietly announced a 
decision to let rates rise again for electricity consumers. The state will 
accept the 10% emergency surcharge levied on consumers in January as a 
permanent increase as well as an additional 10% increase for consumers that 
will take effect early 2002 when the old 1996 rate cut legislation expires. 
That would bring the average charge to about 8 cents a kilowatt hour. 

FERC
The other major danger to the transmission line deal is that the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission can block the deal simply by failing to approve 
it in a positive vote. Senior California officials and legislators doubt that 
FERC has jurisdiction, and believe that FERC would not dare stop a deal. But 
they may be wrong. "The deal can only go through if FERC specifically signs 
off on the deal. Its power over transmission deal is absolute, no matter what 
anyone says," according to source close to the President. There are three 
possibilities: 1) FERC could "pocket veto" it by not even putting it on 
agenda for discussion; 2) the deal is put on the agenda but it gets voted 
down. The Democrat on the commission, William Massey, has already said he is 
opposed to it; or 3) the Commission could approve it but with condition that 
Davis has to agree to bring the lines into a regional grid system.

One complicating factor in the FERC decision, however, is that its chairman 
Curt Hebert, who is adamantly opposed to the transmission line sale, may not 
be around long enough to have his say. "Hebert is definitely not a shoo in 
for the FERC chairman position," says one Washington official. Two other 
appointments to the Commission will soon be named, this official notes, and 
one of them "could easily become chairman."

See my storage story that begins on 1. Plus you might find the issue to be
of interest. I will be doing little occasionally fee pieces for the
Transportation &
Storage Report and will be having lunch with them tomorrow so any thoughts
you have on my piece or the report would be appreciated.
