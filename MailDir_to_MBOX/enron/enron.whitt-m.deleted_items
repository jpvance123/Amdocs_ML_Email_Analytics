        Dear Mark,

        Protection for your Palm&#153; handheld is worth its weight in gold, 
        plus the five dollars you'll save if you purchase the Palm Protection 
        Plan between now and Jan 4, 2002.  
        <br><img src="http://images4.postdirect.com/master-images/404667/clear.gif" width="1" height="8" border="0"><br>
        The Palm Protection Plan is the best way to extend the coverage of 
        the original manufacturer's warranty.  At last, a plan that includes 
        screen repair! And when you compare the cost of Palm's plans to actual 
        repair costs....well, let's just say it's a <nobr>no-brainer.</nobr>  
        <br><img src="http://images4.postdirect.com/master-images/404667/clear.gif" width="1" height="8" border="0"><br>
        For peace of mind this holiday season and beyond, invest in a Palm 
        Protection Plan. Just enter promo code <b>PPP5DSC</b> at check out to receive $5 off.

Subject:	Important Information About Security & ClickAtHome


Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!
__________________________________
To download the software:
1)  Visit the ClickAtHome Portal at www.clickathome.net from your ClickAtHome PC.
2)  Logon to the Portal with your personally created Portal User ID and Password, or create a new account if you have not created a user ID and password by selecting "Create a NEW Account" at the top left corner.  The Portal User IDs and Passwords are created by you.  The Enron Help Desk is not able to assist with Portal support, but if you need any assistance, please send an email to "clickathome@enron.com".
3) Once you have logged on, select "Tools" from the top menu bar.
4) Under the "Secure Download" heading, click on "BlackICE" or "Norton" and log on to the download page using your SAP ID and Date of Birth.
5) Follow the directions provided on screen.

 From the 11/26/01 New Dem Daily.  Please let the Colorado DLC know what 
you think.

With the U.S. economy in recession and the unemployment rate up above 5 
percent, there is naturally some speculation that the millions of former 
welfare recipients who began working since the 1996 national welfare reform 
legislation was enacted may now be at special risk of falling back onto 
public assistance. Indeed, within the last week, columnists E.J. Dionne of 
The Washington Post and Bob Herbert of The New York Times have suggested 
that the successful welfare reform experiment of the 1990s might soon fall 
apart in the wake of recession.

But the facts suggest otherwise.  In an article for the forthcoming 
January/February 2002 edition of Blueprint magazine, which will focus on 
the next steps in welfare reform, Blueprint Executive Editor Tom Mirga 
takes a look at the record and finds abundant evidence that welfare 
reform's success story remains stubbornly intact so far despite the new 
pressures of a slowing economy 
(http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?contentid=3961&kaid=114&subid=143).

Exhibit A of Mirga's case is a mid-October survey by the Welfare to Work 
Partnership, a voluntary association of more than 20,000 companies who have 
agreed to hire welfare recipients.  According to Rodney Carroll, the 
president and CEO of the Partnership, 57 percent of the firms he surveyed 
said they were still hiring entry-level workers, and another 18 percent 
predicted they would be hiring such workers by the end of the 
year.  Eighty-seven percent of the firms reported that they had not laid 
off any former welfare recipients during the previous two months - which 
included the period immediately after the September 11 terrorist attacks 
when the travel and entertainment industries took a huge hit.

Mirga also looked at the official numbers in the five states with the 
largest welfare caseloads: California, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania, and 
Michigan.  In all but Michigan, caseload levels remained stable at 
historically low levels since last fall, when the 1990s boom first stalled 
nationally.  Michigan experienced a 3 percent increase in caseloads between 
September 2000 and March of 2001, but the level of public assistance is 
still only about a third of what it was at its peak in the 1980s.

In Texas and Pennsylvania, Mirga discovered that some of the upward 
pressure on caseload levels is attributable to deliberate policy changes 
that allowed welfare recipients to retain some public assistance while 
working in private sector jobs.  While expressing considerable concern 
about the effects of a sustained period of rising unemployment, state 
officials remain very optimistic about the long-term job prospects of their 
former and current clients.

What they understand - and many persistent critics of work-based welfare 
reform don't - is that the welfare system has undergone a profound cultural 
change since 1996.  Michigan welfare director Doug Howard, who is also 
president of the American Public Human Services Association, says work 
requirements have permanently and dramatically changed the attitudes of 
both recipients and welfare administrators.  "New entrants now come in with 
the expectation that welfare is temporary and transitional and that they 
need to move into employment and help their family," Howard says.  "There's 
been a cultural change for our staff as well, a new attitude about moving 
families quicker."

New York welfare agency spokesman Jack Madden echoes this belief that a 
more work-oriented system will help recipients weather hard economic 
times:  "[They] now have a work history, they understand the importance of 
work in their personal lives and they will be able to jump back into 
employment when the economy picks up steam again.  You have to compare that 
with the old welfare system, which kept people in poverty regardless of the 
economy."

The debate over the economy and welfare reform is of particular importance 
because the 1996 law is up for reauthorization in Congress next year.  Many 
of the original critics of work-based welfare reform, having grudgingly 
admitted its success, are now calling for a significant scaling back of 
work requirements and time limits on grounds that they can only work in a 
red-hot economy with plentiful jobs.

No one is arguing we shouldn't be worried about the impact of the economic 
slowdown on welfare recipients, many of whom do not yet qualify for 
unemployment insurance if they do lose their jobs.  Today's relatively 
positive picture could clearly get worse.  But the answer is to intensify, 
not retreat from, the new system of job placement, support services, and 
assistance to "make work pay" through health insurance and supplemental 
income support, that was at the heart of the 1996 reforms.

The stubborn good news about welfare reform, even in relatively tough 
economic times, provides ample evidence that it's no time to turn back from 
the most successful social policy innovation of the 1990s.

As could be expected PSCO has finally implemented PRM this year and did a great job of "buying the high'.  Now the rate payers will have lower prices than last year but probably twice as high as they should be.  I would definitely like to discuss it with you.  How about 1:30 central on the 8th?

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

	> costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as "whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction".    

	> in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

	> the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599

I have a meeting in the morning on this deal to get a price for the 10,000/d.  I am hoping that as part of this overall deal I can get a pretty good price on that package.  As far as your analysis goes, I have not gotten through it completely, but make sure that you do not add fuel and commodity charges to the transport that does not flow.  Our current analysis shows that the reallocation on El Paso should take place in the 1st or 2nd quarter.  At that time this capacity will have more value out of the Permian than it does today when it does not flow.  The .38 rate you are using is the current full toll rate. The demand charge is actually only $.3595 and it drops to $.2991 in January 2004.  The commodity charge for San Juan is currently $.026 and drops to $.019 in 2004.  Let's go through this and the other components in the morning.

Mark,
Help me out here!
I took our current marketing arrangements, selling into the spot
market, assuming the worst at EPNG-SJ Index - $0.10, and compared it to
the pricing under the three tranches.  I realize we are mixing IF and
GDA, but IF can be swapped for GDA and vice-versa in the swing swap
market.  My dilemma is that the firm transportation does not appear to
be accretive, in fact it results in $0.05 / mmbtu  less than current
arrangement (accross the total volume).  What is really killing it is
the NW basis and discount...am I using the right one?  (FYI, I used
ENA's mid-market basis for the 12-month strip going forward).  What am I
missing here?

Mark,

I spoke with our ATT Wireless (Cell Phone) rep. yesterday.  I told him about the Sprint packages that offer many more minutes for same $$ as ATT.  He wants to work with us.  He's on family-leave  for the next 2 weeks, but he and I are scheduled to meet the 2nd week of Oct.  He knows we're doing some comparison shopping, and he doesn't want us to leave.  I think it would be in our best interest to see what he can offer us.

I'll keep you posted.

Mark, do you have any customers that we could invite as a guest to this event. I would be more than happy to host.

I have received the signed CMS Agreement.  I have signed it and returned it and we will be booking the earnings over the next couple of days.  Huber is trying to figure out how they will structure the purchases at the wellhead for royalty purposes.  They are doing this as part of their counterproposal to us.  I do not have very high expectations for this deal happening in the 3rd quarter.  However, Brian Stone will be stuck in a boat with just me and a guide for a total of 8 hours on Wed and Thurs. and I hope to make significant progress in that time.

Please find the attached LOI.  See if it meets with your understanding of the deal.  The document is non-binding but will serve as a framework for the actual agreements.  I will send you draft versions of the other documents on Monday.

Mark,
Help me out here!
I took our current marketing arrangements, selling into the spot
market, assuming the worst at EPNG-SJ Index - $0.10, and compared it to
the pricing under the three tranches.  I realize we are mixing IF and
GDA, but IF can be swapped for GDA and vice-versa in the swing swap
market.  My dilemma is that the firm transportation does not appear to
be accretive, in fact it results in $0.05 / mmbtu  less than current
arrangement (accross the total volume).  What is really killing it is
the NW basis and discount...am I using the right one?  (FYI, I used
ENA's mid-market basis for the 12-month strip going forward).  What am I
missing here?

Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the Grand Canyon. They
are
  at the pearly gates of Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter
the
  gates only if they can answer one simple religious question.

 The question posed by St. Peter is - "What is Easter"?

 The first blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
  when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful."

 "Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
  place!" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
  the same question - "What is Easter?"

 The second blonde replies, "Easter is the holiday in December when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."

 St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

 He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, "Do YOU know
  what Easter is?"

 The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, "I
  know what Easter is."

 "Oh?" says St. Peter, incredulously.

 "Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
  of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
  disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder."

 St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

 Then the third blonde continues ... "Every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!

One of the guys here recieved a call from a guy at EES looking for contacts at gas utilities in the Northwest.  They are hoping to sell them some sort of deal where they provide the utility structured products and the utility pushes them through to the endusers... isn't that my Cascade deal?  Let's discuss Monday, it sounds like something we need to nip in the bud.

That is great!  Let me know when you have time to talk this morning.  I can walk you through any questions regarding the LOI and the economic evaluation.

In addition, Dan and I still need to arrange a conference call with you regarding the Fort Union/Powder deal.  You and I should talk about it prior to that discussion just to make sure we are on the same page regarding the Ft Union capacity deal you are looking at.

Can you change the Huber transaction agreement to reflect the pricing provisions we have laid out in the LOI.  The only other thing I saw in the Capacity release agreement was in 2.6.  If they owe us for any refunds prior to the release date, then we should owe them for any charges in the future for any past periods.

Thanks

We are trying to send out a draft version of these on Monday afternoon.


Thanks

Mark

Mark,

Rate case settlements reached between a pipeline, its customers and Commiss=
ion Staff sometime prescribes the treatment of gains on the sale of assets =
and specifically the sale of base gas volumes (eg Columbia, CNG settlements=
).  In review of the past two rate case settlements of Williston Basin (WBI=
) I found no such provisions.  In its current rate case proceeding before F=
ERC a limited settlement was reached which dealt primarily with net plant a=
nd labor costs.  A hearing was held on all remaining issues and is currentl=
y in the briefing stage.  Neither in the limited settlement, nor in the hea=
ring was disposition of base gas revenues addressed.

However, the reorganizational settlement that conveyed facilities from MDU =
to WBI may be a factor.  As a result of restructuring under 636 WBI was obl=
igated to sell certain excess volumes of company owned working gas (priced =
at $.47 /mcf) to its customers.  WBI proposed to sell the gas at market and=
 retain any profits.  As mentioned in the LeBeoeuf, Lamb memo the Commissio=
n addressed this issues several times, reversing itself in the process, and=
 finally ordered that WBI must sell the working gas at cost.  Though not re=
lying entirely on the reorganizational settlement, throughout the various o=
rders, the Commission referenced the 1985 reorganizational settlement as re=
quiring any gains on the sale of working gas to be flowed through to WBI cu=
stomers.  WBI sought rehearing, arguing that the Commission was taking a ve=
ry broad interpretation of the settlement.  The Commission raised the issue=
 again in its order on rehearing, among other things, and WBI didn't seek r=
ehearing or pursue that particular argument further, which the Commission p=
oints out in its final order.

As LeBeoeuf Lamb asserts, the environment (Order 636 restructuring) in whic=
h the Commission ordered flow-through of profits on the sale of storage vol=
umes has changed and those arguments may not be applicable anymore.  But, t=
he reorganizational settlement might be something to take into account and =
should be discussed with WBI.  Just something to be aware of.

If you have any questions please call.

Robert

Please find the attached LOI.  See if it meets with your understanding of the deal.  The document is non-binding but will serve as a framework for the actual agreements.  I will send you draft versions of the other documents on Monday.

Have a great weekend!
