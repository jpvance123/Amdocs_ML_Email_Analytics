Kim, thanks for your quick response and patience.  We're going to do
something.  My guess is next week.  I guessed $5.20 this morning in some
analysis I did so the magnitude of the change in price was not unexpected.

Jeff,

Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent
price for you.  For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January,
2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.  Nymex
for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the
little increase in price.  Let me know if there is anything else you
need -

Thanks,

Kim

The contract provides for a Material Adverse Change if our credit rating goes below BBB- which it has.  This is a triggering event.  When this occurs they can initiate the process moving to terminate the agreement.

Citizens is initiating the process to terminate our agreement.  They will likely recall the capacity on TW and terminate our agency relationships with EP and TW.  They want to know if we are continuing to deliver gas.  Can you call Sean and tell him?

YEAH!  GO VOLS!!!
Tennessee was great.  Trip did not last long enough.  Sorry you are faced
with lay-offs around the holiday season.  I am a worrier too.  I think it
will work out for you... let me know if I can do anything (remember I have
friends in H.R. at Dynegy).

I would like to invite Pierce, Stacey, and Donna (you met them on the ride
and Suzanne knows them).  MAYBE Joe Gordon (he's a Tennessee fan too).
That's it for me.  I'll bring my orange and white pom-poms and other
Tennessee stuff plus beer and snacks... let me know how much/what you think
we'll need!

I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to
get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the

but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to
see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet -

Dear Friend, 
It is said that timing is everything. We particularly liked the timing of the September 7th USA TODAY front page of the Life Section.
USA TODAY has named Rancho La Puerta as the First of Ten Great Places to 
Balance Body and Soul. The article notes that "This health and fitness 
getaway favored by movers and shakers offers 'daily yoga and specialty 
yoga weeks'...and ...'is for people who want a taste of yoga but want to 
do more.' "
Upcoming Ranch yoga specialty weeks include:
October 6th - Yoga and Chi Kung presented by Mara Carrico
December 1st - Iyengar Yoga presented by Jennifer Fox & Phyllis Pilgrim
With blessings for your health and well being,

Holley, Isabelle, Heide, Sarah, Dawn, Veronica and Julia

Sorry I didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule.  Funny how
things can change in just one week!  Suzanne is awesome - don't know what I
would do without her.  We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and
margarita.  Not a late night.  You didn't have to leave - I am glad you
came though.  Hope we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.
(See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships!
and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)

Take care and keep in touch.

Good to see you....sorry it was a bad time for you.  Things will get
better.
It was nice meeting Suzanne and Elizabeth.  Suzanne seems like a really
neat
person.  Did ya'll hang out late?  I didn't want to run off but I thought
you probably needed some quality "girl time".

It is right behind 3112.  There are only 3 garden homes inside the gate -
and 3110 is real big on my double green doors.  Call if you get lost -
713-412-4571.

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the
first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am
behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am
behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the
people gate code is c1984.

See you then -

Kim

We could meet at my house and sit on my patio.  I should stick around until
5:30 or so.  I could be home by 5:45 or 6.  Is that cool?

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Are we coming to your house soon?  Talked to MJ today.  She said you
were looking at Oct. 26 - 28.  Let me know what you are thinking - i can
get airfare for $188 right now.  It would be fun!

Gotta go to a baseball game.  Let's talk later!

Kim,Kim and Melissa,
The cost of your trip insurance was actually 49.00 each. They still refuse
to
refund it and the agent I just spoke with was very nice to see if they could
reaccomodate you in any way on the days you originally requested. She
cannot,
so suggests writing to customer service about the trip insurance refund.
This is who I
spoke with, however. I will get a name, address and phone number of someone
higher

I disagree with them.  We bought a particular product and they wanted to
change it by either 1) making us pay more money and spend more time flying
or 2) making us take two more vacation days that we don't have which = us
paying more money by not getting paid at work.  We loved that trip and
would still take what we originally agreed to.  I don't see how they can
subject us to penalties for something we had not originally agreed to.

Yes, They called this morning. They will refund all but the trip
cancellation insurance
which was 39.00 each. They said that you would have been in cancellation
penalties if you
did not have the insurance, that would have amounted to much more, so I
have
cancelled
it. I do not know how long it will be before it appears as a credit on your
card. It
depends on your billing cycle. It may take 2 cycles. Refunds normally take
longer than
charges, but they are in the process.
Regards,
Dee

Kim, I have left a message for the Customer Relations manager to call me.
When I got in this morning, they had
faxed me an alternate, using Delta for around 4600.00. I checked air only,
in case we could drop the air with
Continental Vacations, but it is between $960.00 and $1,000.00 each.
I'll let you know what happens when I speak with the mgr.

Kim,

The City of Mesa is in receipt of your email confirming Enron's lack of gas
scheduling for Mesa for December 6, 2001.  Based on that email of December
5, 2001, Mesa must find an alternate gas supplier in order to meet Mesa's
present and future gas needs.  Thank you for your assistance.

Cliff

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kim, Patti, Suzanne, and Ted-
 
The total burn nomination for month of January 2002 is 3,989MMBtu per day.  This is made up of the following:
 
1. 3,989MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ SoCalBorder (net, after PG&ENW losses 4,124MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
 
Line loss on the PG & E line for January 2002 remains at 2.20%.  
 
Our Broadway 3 steam plant (65MW) is off line for scheduled maintenance.  We will only have Broadway 2 online on a regular basis.  Our actual usage will probably be about 3,500 to 4,000MMBtu per day, unless the ISO instructs us to put Broadway 1 online.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve

By the way, we are filing our post-hearing brief today with the ACC on SW Gas.  Hopefully this will get resolved before the winter.

We can certainly net the amounts if Pasadena ends up owing us one month, but I only have information to complete invoices through June 2001 and we owe Pasadena for all three months.  I was under the impression that Pasadena wanted to resolve some of these months as quickly as possible.  

I have sent the spreadsheets for May and June to Patti for her to look over before I send them to Pasadena.  I have not heard back from her yet.  You may be able to help, though.  Do you know the negotiated prices for the El Paso fixed capacity for May forward?  I need them to finish the calc sheets.  Patti was going to look them up for me, but she hasn't had a chance yet.  I have attached the May and June files in case you want to review them.   I need the price for the box highlighted in yellow on each sheet.  As soon as I have all of the information for July forward, I can finish the invoices.  I am still in need of the El Paso deliveries, the Kern River deliveries and the nomination email from Pasadena for each month.

k,


thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....

Please define close?  Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?  Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.  I would like to walk through the deal.

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the "Wood" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

Kim,

The FedEx package of contracts is going out tonight.  I've included:

Clarke County gas purchase agreement with APEA
SMUD gas purchase agreement with APEA
Enron gas supply agreement with APEA

I told Roger Mock that once we confirmed that the delivery point with SMUD and ensured that we were comfortable moving it, we'd let him know.  I also wanted to make sure that from the West Gas Desk's perspective, if we change the delivery point but leave quantity and term alone there would be no price differential to APEA?  Just keep me posted.

Could you find our November PPL/Griffith cost spreadsheet and send a copy to me.  I asked Mara for a copy but she wrote back saying she was no longer with Enron and to contact you.  I'm trying to get a jump on the Holiday craziness.

i finished and it was still light out, i'll just leave it at that.  i was
sick all last week and still am so i was having a really hard time catching
my breath.  i did finish though.  went to a great restaurant, el gaucho???
i was surprised that i had never been there on business, the steak was
excellent.  leaving for cda a week from tomorrow, coming back friday night
or saturday morning, undecided as of right now.  as far as it being
beneficial for you to go, is it beneficial for me to go to these trips?  who
knows, but i go because it's fun and it's free.  i plan on playing a lot of
golf and hitting the spa frequently.  you should definitely go, i'm sure
it's been a week or so since your last vacation.  let me know what you
decide, it would be good to see you, especially the week after the big
uga-ut game....

Kim,

Stewart and I met with Tom Lee (tomlee@ncpa.com; 916.761.4220) of NCPA yesterday.  NCPA is looking to restructure a power deal with Calpine and a gas basis deal with Pan Canadian.  The following summarizes the gas transaction and the re-structuring as proposed by Tom.

Current Gas Structure

Term:  		January 1, 2002 - December 31, 2002
Quantity:	5,000 MMBtu/d
Delivery Pt.:	PG&E City-Gate
Price:		NYMEX + $3.37/MMBtu

Re-Structuring Option 1

Extend the term through 2004.  What is the blended basis?

Re-Structuring Option 2

(Kim, please note that the following structure is Tom Lee's creation).

ENA assumes NCPA's position for Q2 2002 only (April-June):  5,000 MMBtu/d @ PG&E City-Gate @ NYMEX + $3.37/MMBtu.

ENA buys 3 puts from NCPA involving 5,000 MMBtu/d @ PG&E City-Gate over a 3 year term ending 2004:

a)  Exercisable on Dec 15, 2001, ENA has the option to put 5,000 MMBtu/d to NCPA in Q1, Q3 and/or Q4 of 2002.
b)  Exercisable on Dec 15, 2002, ENA has the option to put 5,000 MMBtu/d to NCPA in Q1, Q2, Q3 and/or Q4 of 2003.
c)  Exercisable on Dec 15, 2003, ENA has the option to put 5,000 MMBtu/d to NCPA in Q1, Q2, Q3 and/or Q4 of 2004.

What is the strike price?

Re-Structuring Option 3

(Kim, this is my idea.  That is, I think this makes more sense than Tom's).

ENA assumes NCPA's position for Q2 2002 only (April-June):  5,000 MMBtu/d @ PG&E City-Gate @ NYMEX + $3.37/MMBtu.

ENA sells NCPA 5,000 MMBtu/d of gas at PG&E City-gate for calendar years 2002 through 2004 except for Q2 2002.  Given that we are absorbing the $3.37/MMBtu basis for Q2 2002, what is the all-in fixed price for this sale?

Tom is looking for an answer ASAP.

Is the above confusing enough?  Call me if we need to talk about this.

Laird

Good to see you....sorry it was a bad time for you.  Things will get better.
It was nice meeting Suzanne and Elizabeth.  Suzanne seems like a really neat
person.  Did ya'll hang out late?  I didn't want to run off but I thought
you probably needed some quality "girl time".

It is right behind 3112.  There are only 3 garden homes inside the gate -
and 3110 is real big on my double green doors.  Call if you get lost -

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the
first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am
behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am
behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the
people gate code is c1984.

See you then -

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Connie, 

Thank you for sending the non-cash settlement template.  What I really need is the coding from you for
our Invoice # EAMR-ENA-01 dated Sept. 21, 2001 in the amount of $24,000 for
daily fee of insurance coverage for Citizens Communications at the Griffith Power Plant located in
Kignman AZ.  This invoice has been approved by Kim Ward.

Please provide me ENA's  expense or  project SAP Coding: Co. # , Cost Element#/Account#, Cost center # or
Far Order# or WBS# etc...

Once I receive the coding from you, I will book the journal entries -  debit your company and credit to 
our company.  The intercompany cross charge accounts - payables and receivables between these
two companies will be created automatically then we will settle the balances through non-cash settlement
process on 5th workday.


Thanks,

Judy 3-7193

Good morning Kim,

I have a few questions to ask regarding natural gas.

1. Do you require a new customer to have a minimum load?  Is there also a
maximum?

2. Must they be in a particular territory, for example SoCalGas?

3. What length contracts are you offering?

4r. What financial hedges do you offer?  NGI, Fixed, Caller (ceiling / floor
caps) etc.

5. Are you looking for agency relationships?  Do you pay a commission if
business is brought to you?

If you have any questions, please call me directly at (949) 655-7363.
Please respond at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your time,

Jenni Rougvie

We are going to meet up later with his Aunt & Uncle (very fun people) and he and Cher around 9pm.  I have to go to a happy hour for Tosha's departure at 5:30 at Tealas.  You are welcome to come if you like.  

Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.  A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.  We are planning to go around lunch time.  That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.  Are you in??  I hope so.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Kim, please schedule the appropriate people for a 15 minute discussion. I am sure that this can be resolved.  Also, be prepared to discuss the "Penalties" component of our obligations to put this in perspective.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Kim:  I apologize.  There are several that I recommend.

Olivia Ostrin
St. Joseph Pro. Bldg also on Westcott in Memorial Park area
Good solid therapist
713 709-7505

Carol Hershkowitz
Same bldg as Olivia dntown
Good Therapist also has group for women
281 240-0777

Carol Gilbert
In Montrose area, off Alabama
Good Therapist
713 527-8002

Marilyn Denham
Higland Village
713 963-0233

All are seasoned clinicians.  I've had good reports from persons that have been to see them.  If the arrangment works well for you here, let me know.  In any event the sessions from this point carry a $20 co-pay.  Insurance picks up the rest.  Let me know who you schedule an appointment with and I will get the authorization for the first 6  visits.  Subsequent visits will be authorized by the provider.

Carlos, you should luv this  one!
 
An announcement from Santa. . .  
> 
>I regret to inform you  that, effective immediately, I will no longer be  
>able to serve the  Southern United States on Christmas Eve. Due to the 
>overwhelming current  population of the earth, my contract was  
renegotiated 
>by North American  Fairies and Elves Local 209. I now serve  
>only certain areas of  Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan.  
As 
>part of the new and  better contract I also get longer breaks for milk  
and 
>cookies so keep that in  mind. However, I'm certain that your children  
will 
>be in good hands with  your local replacement who happens to be my third  
>cousin, Bubba Claus.  His side of the family is from the South Pole. He 
>shares my goal of  delivering toys to all the good boys and girls;  
however, 
>there are a few  differences between us. 
> 
>Differences such as:  
> 
>1. There is no danger  of a Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba  
Claus. 
>He has a gun rack on  his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads: "These  
>toys insured by Smith  and Wesson," 
> 
>2. Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that  children leave 
an 
>RC cola and pork rinds [or a moon pie] on the fireplace.  And Bubba 
doesn't 
>smoke a pipe. He dips a little snuff though, so please  have an empty 
spit 
>can handy. 
> 
>3. Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared, flyin'  coon dogs 
instead 
>of reindeer. I made the mistake of loaning him a couple  of my 
>reindeer one time, and Blitzen's head now overlooks  Bubba's fireplace. 
> 
>4. You won't hear "On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and  Blitzen.. " when 
Bubba 
>Claus arrives. Instead, you'll hear, "On Earnhardt, on  Wallace, on 
Martin 
>and Labonte. On Rudd, on Jarrett, on Elliott and  Petty." 
> 
>5. "Ho, ho, ho!" has been replaced by "Yee Haw!" And you  also are 
likely to 
>hear Bubba's elves respond, "I her'd dat!" 
> 
>6. As required by  Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have  
a 
>Yosemite Sam safety  triangle on the back with the words 
>"Back off" The last I heard it also had other decorations  on the sleigh 
>back as well. One is Ford or Chevy logo with lights that  race through 
the 
>letters and the other is a caricature of me (Santa Claus)  going wee wee 
on 
>the Tooth Fairy.  
> 
>7. The usual Christmas  movie classics such as "Miracle on 34th Street"  
and 
>"It's a Wonderful Life"  will not be shown in your negotiated viewing  
area. 
>Instead, you'll see  "Boss Hogg Saves Christmas" and "Smokey and the  
Bandit 
>IV" featuring Burt  Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state patrol  
cars 
>crashing into each  other. 
> 
>8. Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. If I were you, I'd  make sure you, 
the 
>wife, and the kids turn the other way when he bends over  to put 
presents 
>under the tree.  
> 
>9. And finally, lovely  Christmas songs have been sung about me like  
>"Rudolph The Red-nosed  Reindeer" and Bing Crosby's "Santa Claus Is  
>Coming to Town." This  year songs about Bubba Claus will be played on  
all 
>the AM radio stations  in the South. Those song titles will be Mark  
>Chesnutt's "Bubba Claus  Shot the Jukebox"; Cledus T. Judd's "All I Want  
for 
>Christmas Is My Woman  and a Six Pack", and Hank Williams 
>Jr.'s "If You Don't Like Bubba Claus, You Shove  It." 
> 
>Sincerely Yours, Santa Claus  
>(member of North  American Fairies and Elves local 209)

Folks, 

Had an idea to get together this weekend at the casa and maybe watch a little football, shoot some pool, drink some wine (or beer), and 'whine' about Enron. Who knows when we'll all get together again, so anyone up for a Sat night down South of town?

Let's hear some interest out there!

Brad

Stacy -

With respect to Item 6 of Frito-Lay's Special Provisions, I propose that we modify that paragraph to read more like our ENFOLIO.  My suggestion is that we replace Frito-Lay's Item 6 with the attached.  Please review and contact Kim Ward as soon as possible with language acceptable to Legal.


Thanks,

JRW

Hey,
The weather here is awesome...cloudy and low 90's.
My family is coming down this weekend for the Oregon /UA game....you must be
the biggest Duck fan in Texas.

Sorry to hear about your Aruba trip. 14-16 October sounds good. I don't have
a calendar in front of me. Let's talk in the next week. I'll call you at work.

Hello Kim,
 
My name is Joelene Whittaker and I am a recruiter with  STM Associates. DTE Energy, www.dtecs.com/sitemap.html , has retained us to  assist them in placing two Director of Sales for Eastern and Western  Regions. The Eastern position will be located in Ann Arbor, Michigan and  the Western position in Denver, Colorado.  Both Director of Sales will  report to the Vice President of Sales.
 
Qualifications of this position include a minimum of 5 years  of sales experience and an additional minimum of 2 years experience with a  trading company is preferred.  The successful candidate will have a strong  understanding of U.S. Coal, Transportation and Electric Utility industries,  including coal tolling, marketing and origination functions used in support of  coal trading operations.  Solid experience in finding ways to capitalize on  opportunities in the coal and transportation business is a must.  A  background which includes Senior-level contract negotiations is  required.
 
We are asking for recommendations from coal trading  executives within the energy  industry.  Would you take  a moment to consider colleagues whose experience fits DTE's  profile and who you would deem as a high caliber candidate for the  position.

Kim -
Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.

Kim,

I represent a firm which has specialized in energy and power market
placement for over ten years.  I'm currently working with several
organizations across the country looking for energy traders, originators,
coordinators, analysts and schedulers.  These are great opportunities to
change location or better ones position quickly.  I'd like to schedule a ten
minute telephone conversation to discuss these positions and determine
whether or not you may have interest or may be able to assist with these
openings.

Please reply or call me at 630-990-7510 at your earliest convenience.  I
look forward to speaking with you soon.

Best Regards,
Todd Kubicki

Kim,

Roger Mock and one or two of his colleagues will be calling me momentarily to discuss the APEA contract.  Once he calls, I'll patch you in.

John:

Here is a very rough draft of the amendment that 1)  clarifies the gas pricing and 2) adds firm peaking gas.  I will call to discuss.

Sounds like all is well.  Still no regrets about moving back?  Good!  We are
well.  Abri is teething still, molars this time and it is hurting all of us.
I'm sure she is feeling most the pain, so I should stop whining.  I am very
curious about this new beau.  I'm very happy for you.  You better let me
know when you are in town.  Theresa, you and I can have a martinee lunch or
dinner.  It would be great fun.  We will leave Cory at home and I will bring
the latest pics of Abri.

Kim, Patti, Suzanne, and Ted-
 
The total burn nomination for month of December 2001 is 6,500MMBtu per day.  This is made up of the sum of the following:
 
1. 3,989MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ SoCal Border (net, after PG&ENW losses 4,124MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa@ $7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. Saleto Enron at SoCalBorder, 3,989MMBtu/day at $2.68/MMBtu
 
Line loss on the PG & E line for December 2001 is 2.20%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.  However, we are looking into selling it and will notify you if we are successful.
 
Our Broadway 3 steam plant (65MW) is off line for scheduled maintenance.  We will only have Broadway 2 online on a regular basis.  Our actual usage will probably be about 3,500 to 4,000MMBtu per day, unless the ISO instructs us to put Broadway 1 online.  Should Broadway 1 be called upon, our usage will go up to 6,500MMBtu/day.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.
 
-Steve

Don,

Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?

Thanks,

Kim Ward

The differences we had on Friday were mainly volume related. Correcting the deal in SITARA and UNIFY relates to volume actualizations.  It is not pricing related. As we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas.  Redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis.  In otherwords, when Palo Alto "Burns" less than we actualy schedule on the transport.  Presumably we sell this gas to other 3rd parties, and Palo Alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation.  I do not think ther are additional fees we would pay on top of reimburseing them for the variable costs, but I am not 100% certain.

Please let me know if ther are any other questions.

Thanks

Anne

Kim -
Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Kim

Kim:

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Kim

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kim,

We spoke last week about a possible 5 yr gas deal for our Yuba City plant.
Below is our RFP.  I'll call to discuss.

Thanks, Paul Cummins
916-996-2291 cell
916-447-5171 work

Request for Proposal ("RFP")
Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP
650 Bercut Drive, Suite C
Sacramento, CA  95814


Background.  Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP ("YCC") is the owner of a 49
megawatt cogeneration facility ("Facility") in Yuba City, California.  YCC
sells its 49 megawatts to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. ("PG&E"), an entity
that recently filed for bankruptcy protection.  YCC recently entered into a
five-year, fixed-price electricity agreement with PG&E, and YCC desires to
enter into a long-term Natural Gas Supply Agreement ("NGSA") with an
appropriate supplier ("Seller") of natural gas.  The NGSA shall be subject to
approval of the YCC project lenders, and YCC will only be able to enter into
the NGSA after bankruptcy court approval of the five-year, fixed-price
electricity agreement with PG&E. As a result, YCC will require a daily update
to proposals it receives (to account for varying market conditions) until it
receives all necessary approvals to enter into a final NGSA.

Term. The term sheet contemplates either a three-year natural gas supply
agreement or a five-year natural gas supply agreement.  Under either term,
the starting date will be tentatively August 1, 2001, subject to the
necessary approvals.

Point(s) of Delivery.  PG&E City Gate.

Annual Volumes.  For the purposes of this RFP, it is assumed that the
Facility will consume monthly and annual gas volumes under one of three
different operating scenarios:

    Scenario        Annual Volume, mmBtu

       1                1,210,000


The typical, historical daily usage at the Facility has been 6,000 mmBtu/day,
except periods of maintenance or reduction by the Facility due to the
satisfaction of capacity requirements under its power purchase agreement
("PPA") with PG&E, and the typical, monthly historical usage has been based
upon a Monday through Friday operation.  Scenario 1 is indicative of plant
operations for the satisfaction of the minimum requirements of the PPA,
essentially 80%.

YCC would prefer a NGSA that is based upon annual volumes in a rolling
12-month period.

Monthly Balancing.  Monthly balancing on the PG&E system shall be the
Seller's responsibility, subject to the limitations of the YCC's natural gas
transportation agreement with PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules
and tariffs.  Seller shall be responsible for any gas imbalance charges
incurred on the PG&E System.

Usage Estimates.  For the purpose of assisting Seller in the Nomination
process, YCC shall make usage estimates in advance and as usage occurs.
Seller should specify requested frequency of usage estimates.

Monthly True-Up.  Actual usage at the Facility will almost certainly be of
some variance to the forecasted monthly gas volumes.  Seller shall propose a
means of "true-ing up" the actual usage to the forecasted monthly volumes.
The ideal system of true-ing up would allow for flexibility to both YCC and
Seller ("the Parties") under the following minimum circumstances:

1. True-up of variance between forecasted usage and actual, if any.

2. If gas price volatility has created daily or other market pricing that
creates financial incentive to the Parties to curtail deliveries to the
Facility and remarket the natural gas to the spot or other market.

3. Allowance for the Facility to curtail deliveries for planned or unplanned
maintenance.

Monthly true-up may incorporate resolution of the differences between price
and volume.

Day of Nomination.  The date of Nomination of daily gas volumes by the Seller
to the PG&E City Gate shall be at the option of, and as determined by Seller,
subject to the limitations of YCC's natural gas transportation agreement with
PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules and tariffs.

Maximum Daily Nomination Quantity:  YCC's natural gas transportation
agreement with PG&E allows for a maximum daily nomination quantity of 9,550
MMbtu/Day.

Price.  YCC seeks a NGSA that will provide a physical price hedge via three
alternative strategies.  The strategies are as follows:

Strategy        Price Hedge

       1            Fixed price for the term.
       2            Floating price, with a not-to-exceed cap.
       3            Floating price, with a minimum and maximum price.

YCC acknowledges that other hedging strategies exist and may be advisable for
the NGSA.  The Seller is encouraged to supply a proposal that incorporates
other strategies.

Credit and Payment Terms.  YCC can offer the following credit and payment
mechanisms for the purpose of removing credit and payment concern from the
Seller:

1. Semi-Monthly Payment. Semi-Monthly payment for gas based on expected
consumption over the first fifteen (15) calendar-day period of each month,
and the expected consumption over the balance of each month via a wire from
YCC to be made one day following the receipt of payments for electrical
energy from PG&E.

2. Priority payment.  YCC has an agreement with its lender that costs of fuel
shall have first priority in the waterfall of cash flows, i.e. the fuel
supplier shall be paid from project cash flows prior to the payment of all
other costs incurred, including repayment of debt, operations and maintenance
costs, management fees, etc.

RFP Response may be sent via fax to Paul Cummins @ 916-447-7602.  Please call
916-447-5171 for questions.

Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.  We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.

Thanks,
Mike

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Frank,

I am working with Panda Resources to potentially supply gas to a couple of their Arizona facilities.  However, they say they have a plant coming online March 1st in El dorado, Ark.  They looking for TX Gas for Mar - jun and Tn zone 0 starting July 1.  She has gone over the structures that she is looking for.  Is there someone in your group that would be interested in working on this potential gas supply with them?  Let me know.

Thanks,

We need to protect the flows to Citizens on TW.  I know you guys have been working on this, but Citizens continues to receive cuts.  Please secure the supply off of TW.  Let Sempra know that IB Link gas will not do.

Kim -

You should probably hold off on the financial trading for now.  Santa Clara is a municipal entity, and until Legal has scrubbed them for authorization to trade financially, we can't do anything with them.  As you know, this is not a quick endeavor.

I can start working on a Master Physical right away, though.  Do you have updated financial info from them?

I understand the need to find cheap flights. this whole enron meltdown has forced us all to take a closer look at our personal balance sheets. i imagine it might be pretty hard to take monday off, but one option would be to catch a morning flight home on monday. i'd be very inclined to do so, but it may be hard for you guys. maybe you have some work to do in California?? i will probably stay through sunday night. check with southwest airlines-- they may have a cheaper fare to oakland, and i can definitely get you to that airport. any thoughts on who else from houston might want to come down?

Hey Kim,

Please contact Megan Parker from now on for Citizens.  I will be helping transition this off to her, but most of the activity needs to be addressed with her.


Thanks!!

Hi Kim--Thanks for the info. I won't go to the mall on Halloween. Actually

everything going for you?     Matt

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Citizens is initiating the process to terminate our agreement.  They will likely recall the capacity on TW and terminate our agency relationships with EP and TW.  They want to know if we are continuing to deliver gas.  Can you call Sean and tell him?

Hi Kim,
I was just thinking about you.  If I'm remembering correctly, you have a
birthday sometime this month, is that right?  Let me wish you a happy
birthday (late or early)!  Hope everything is going well for you.  Maria,
Janice, Sonya, and Sylvia still talk about how nice you are and what a great
person you were to work with.  I've tried to tell them how mean you are, but
they just will not believe me.  If this note goes through to you, write back
and I'll forward your reply on to those Day Ahead ladies, they would get a
kick out of hearing from you.  By the way, Maria wants to know how old you
are?   :o)
Happy B-day Kim!

Your friend,

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Hi Girls,

I just wanted to say thank you for the flowers.  They were beautiful and
still in great shape when I left on Tuesday.

They were peach and yellow roses with red eucalyptus berries, baby's breath,
and greenery.  The bow was strands of yellow and brown raffia.  Don't know
how ya'll knew, but peach is my favorite color rose and yellow is my second
favorite.  I really appreciate it.

My mother and my sister said to tell ya'll that was the prettiest bouquet we
received, and it was.  We had it on a table at the funeral home with various
pictures and other mementos of my daddy's life.  I left them on my mother's
coffee table so she could enjoy them.  She commented on them each day, so I
know they have given her much pleasure.

Thanks again and love to all of you.  I'm looking forward to fun, sun,
sailing, and lots and lots and lots and lots of BEER!!!!!!!

Hi Kim, hope you're doing well.  Just received comments from our 
Lawyers for your Master Enfolio. Should I be speaking with you or 
someone else? 
Also, could you give me a quote of what a daily call for Q3 will be 
at the money for 5,000 mmBtu/day. 
Thanks, 
I really appreciate it.

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Kim, John Cogan and  I had called asking for copies of three transaction agreements.  I had not  seen those yet so I wanted to send an e-mail clarifying which dates we are  looking for.  Could you please fax copies of the transaction agreements  dated: 3/11/99, 11/28/00 & 6/1/01 to me at fax number 520-779-5338.   Thanks very much for your help with this.

Hi,  

Just wanted to get an update from you on the Citizens info I asked you about last week.  I am wondering about the payment to John Cogan for Aug production and the EAMR payment due.  Did you talk to Sarabeth about that?


Thanks
Darla

Subject:	Socal Window Meeting

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Kim,

Sorry that I have not called in a while.  I have been busy and with all the
distractions at Enron, I did not want to bother you.  I hope you are coping
through the mess and hope that you also had a good Xmas and New Year.

I am in Houston next week (arriving the 7th) and would like to see you.  If
you are available, I'd be happy to buy lunch or dinner.  Please let me know.

Take care,

Laird

Good news about Suzanne as well.  I hope that gig lasts past the Spring.
I'll be around for Thanksgiving.  Give me your number again.  If you are
around, I'll try to come have a beer or two with you (I'll bring it this
time).

Wow - I think the world is coming to an end.  All these huge changes.  Not
much going on over here - doing busines as usual - don't htink I will see a
change for a few months, if at all.  Maybe just some new faces - I think
that there will be some hostility and not really looking forward to that
part.  Moved onto the new trading floor this morning - chaos!  But very
nice.  Unfortuneately, you know who is on my floor - bummer!  Anyway, as
for Suzanne - she was with EES on a product development project.  She
worked with Corporate development on the Dynegy transaction and has been
asked to stay on with Corp Dev to sell more asset through march or april.
At least this way, she knows she is employed until then.  She wasn't so
sure about the EES gig and I think she is right.  My parents were going to
come here for Thanksgiving but my mother has this "feeling" that they
shouldn't make the trip - so they aren't coming.  Don't know for sure what
I will do but I refuse to sit at home entertaining myself for 4 days - I am
sick of hanging out with myself!!!  You are probobly going somewhere warmer
and perhaps tropical?  I hope you have a great thanksgiving!  Lets get a
beer after - its the holiday season and time for (good) cheer!

Big Bosses are calling this a merger of equals but we won't really know for
a couple years.  HQ in Houston (Conoco), board split 50/50 but there will
be
a Phillips guy running the show when Dunham (Conoco) leaves in '04.
Doesn't
look like a big change for the floor except picking up more production
(most
of Phillips volumes with Duke EFS).

What is going on over there?  Glad to hear you have been given some
assurance.  What about Suzanne?

Are you going home for T/Giving?

Hi Kim,

I just got word through Coral that Enron Canada has defaulted on the
delivery of our APEA gas.  I'm sure you're going through a lot of these but
I need some details and contact names to get this resolved.  Please give me
a call ASAP.

Thanks,

An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for 
gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call 
options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call 
option would be $.60 with a strike of $3.10. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

I'm still holding on by a thin thread here in Portland, but I wanted to send you my vitals as I'm experiencing advanced symptoms of the travel bug. Needless to say, you're one of the major reasons I have no regrets about having worked at Enron. Definitely stay in touch.

Good choice.  The auth # is 252134-2.  I have communicated that to Olivia.  That is for the first six visits.  Additional ones will be requested directly by Olivia.  There is a $20. co-pay per visit.  Jim

All are seasoned clinicians.  I've had good reports from persons that have been to see them.  If the arrangment works well for you here, let me know.  In any event the sessions from this point carry a $20 co-pay.  Insurance picks up the rest.  Let me know who you schedule an appointment with and I will get the authorization for the first 6  visits.  Subsequent visits will be authorized by the provider.

Craig,
 
In the month of August, EPME nominated the requested volumes to 9JZ2 (Citizen's San Juan Pool Contract).  The nomination was not confirmed by your operations group, thus the nominated volume was reduced to zero.  To answer your question, I recommend confirming the gas EPME nominates.  If you have any questions about the nominating procedure, please contact Jason Kelm (713-420-6038).  In regards the month of September, the first day the gas was confirmed was 9-8-01.  So far, 10,313 mmbtus have been delivered.

I sent the message below at the end of August and the one below that at the end of July.  

The only problem is that NO gas was scheduled during August and I can't find any gas for September!  Now the imbalance has grown larger instead of smaller!!  

I also need gas for October.  What do I need to do to get this scheduled and confirmed for October?

Please define close?  Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?  Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.  I would like to walk through the deal.

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the "Wood" report mean ?  
 
See you.

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Contract.doc)

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Kim,

Thanks, Beth.  Credit will review and I will let you know if he has any
questions.  I think the next thing we were waiting on were your new
contracts.  If you guys need anything   while we are waiting on those,
please let me know!  Also, if we need to meet in person, once we get things
rolling, we are available to come to Dallas.

Thanks,

Kim

Subject: fire truck
Date: Mon, 17 Dec 2001 09:46:04 EST


A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
"That sure is a nice fire truck," the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

"Thanks," the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

"Little partner" the fire fighter says, "I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster."

The little girl says, "You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Subject: Merry Christmas Fellow WJ  Shipmates
Less then 2 weeks to  our Adventure in the Caribbean begins.  I am looking forward to meeting  everyone, relaxing and having a good time.
Hope everyone has a Very Merry  Christmas and a Happy New Year
Looking forward to our pre-cruise get  together Sat Night the 5th.
I was told the Holland House Beach Bar. If anyone  knows different or a time let me know.
Hope everyone enjoys the little  Christmas Article below.
See everyone soon
Shelly B. :-)
-----------------
Subject: Fw: Perfect Christmas 
This  article was submitted to a newspaper contest to find out who had the
wildest  Christmas dinner. This won first prize. 
Christmas with Louise  
As a joke, my brother used to hang a pair of panty hose over his  fireplace
before Christmas. He said all he wanted was for Santa to fill them.  What
they say about Santa checking the list twice must be true because  every
Christmas morning, although Jay's kids' stockings were overflowed,  his
poor pantyhose hung sadly empty. 
One year I decided to make his  dream come true. I put on sunglasses and
went in search of an inflatable love  doll. They don't sell those things at
Wal-Mart. I had to go to an adult  bookstore downtown. If you've never been
in an X-rated store, don't go.  You'll only confuse yourself. I was there
an hour saying things like, "What  does this do?" "You're kidding me!" "Who
would buy that?" Finally, I made it  to the inflatable doll section. I
wanted to buy a standard, uncomplicated  doll that could also substitute as
a passenger in my truck so I could use the  car pool lane during rush hour.
Finding what I wanted was difficult.  Love dolls come in many different 
models. The top of the line, according to  the side of the box, could do 
things I'd only seen in a book on animal  husbandry. I settled for "Lovable
Louise". She was at the bottom of the price  scale. To call Louise a "doll"
took a huge leap of imagination. 
On  Christmas Eve, with the help of an old bicycle pump, Louise came to
life. My  sister-in-law was in on the plan and let me in during the wee
morning hours,  long after Santa had come and gone, I filled the dangling
pantyhose with  Louise's pliant legs and bottom. I also ate some cookies
and drank what  remained of a glass of milk on a nearby tray. 
I went home, and giggled  for a couple of hours. 
The next morning my brother called to say that  Santa had been to his house
and left a present that had made him VERY happy  but had left the dog
confused. She would bark, start to walk away, then come  back and bark some
more. 
We all agreed that Louise should remain in  her panty hose so the rest of
the family could admire her when they came over  for the traditional
Christmas dinner. 
My grandmother noticed Louise  the moment she walked in the door. "What the
hell is that?" she asked.  
My brother quickly explained, "It's a doll." 
"Who would play  with something like that?" Granny snapped. I had several
candidates in mind,  but kept my mouth shut. "Where are her clothes?"
Granny continued.  
"Boy, that turkey sure smells nice, Gran," Jay said, trying to steer her  
into the dining room. 
But Granny was relentless. "Why doesn't she  have any teeth?" Again, I
could have answered, but why would I? It was  Christmas and no one wanted
to ride in the back of the ambulance saying,  "Hang on Granny, Hang on!" 
My grandfather, a delightful old man with  poor eyesight, sidled up to me
and said, " Hey, who's the naked gal by the  fireplace?" I told him she was
Jay's friend. 
A few minutes later I  noticed Grandpa by the mantel, talking to Louise.
Not just talking, but  actually flirting. It was then that we realized this
might be Grandpa's last  Christmas at home. 
The dinner went well. We made the usual small talk  about who had died, who
was dying, and who should be killed, when suddenly  Louise made a noise
that sounded a lot like my father in the bathroom in the  morning. Then she
lurched from the panty hose, flew around the room twice,  and fell in a
heap in front of the sofa. 
The cat screamed. I passed  cranberry sauce through my nose, and grandpa
ran across the room, fell to his  knees, and began administering mouth to
mouth resuscitation. My brother fell  back over his chair and wet his pants
and Granny threw down her napkin,  stomped out of the room, and sat in the
car. 
It was indeed a  Christmas to treasure and remember. 
Later in my brother's garage, we  conducted a thorough examination to
decide the cause of Louise's collapse. We  discovered that Louise had
suffered from a hot ember to the back of her right  thigh. Fortunately,
thanks to a wonder drug called duct tape, we restored her  to perfect
health. Louise went on to star in several bachelor party movies.  
I think Grandpa still calls her whenever he can get out of the house.

Kim,  can you help Merced out with a 10-year PG&E city-gate price assuming a  1/1/2002 start (see message below).  I'll get them the electricity  price.  Indicative price is fine.  We are not going to  transact.
 
Got  your message too about gas prices moving up.  We are still looking at the  blend/extend versus an outright swap of the last almost 3 years.  I'll be  in touch.
 
Thanks  for your help.
 
Jeff

Exelon Energy, our gas marketer, has terminated their gas contract with
Holtermann Farms effective the end of the December 2001 billing period.
Southern California Gas Company provides transportation to our non-core
account. Holtermann Farms has two irrigation wells that have the heaviest
natural gas consumption during the summer months. If your company would be
interested in being our gas marketer, please contact me at
tholtermann@hotmail.com.

Thank You
Tim Holtermann

Kim -
Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.

Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads


I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the "Wood" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

Kim:

It sounds like there have been some changes in the settlements group that have resulted in a billing error for Smurfit.  My guess is they are using the spreadsheet rather than the SoCal Gas imbalance statement to set the volume.

Can you please check and get back to John?

Subject: Enron Billing



Chris,

Enron may have a new person in charge of SSCC Vernon's account now as there
are billing differences once again. Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send
SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the
delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon
is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the
additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon
received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due.

It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the
volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In
any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's
review.

Best regards,
John Ewing

The hotel we are staying at is the Palm Court Hotel in St Martin-on Orient
Beach. Phone number is 590-87 41 94.  Web site (if you want to check it out
tomorrow!) is palm-court.net...The rooms have refridgerators, and I think
breakfast is complimentary. If you need any other info, let me know..

Stacey/Susie-just tell the cab driver you are going to Orient Beach and
once you get there the hotel is on Bikini Beach.

Package details:

Valet service
2 blackjack tables manned by trained Vegas dealers
Special midnight countdown with champagne toast
Open Bar!!!
Two for 1 golf coupon at the Tribute (cost normally around 100 on weekends)
Menu to include (served between 9- 11:15 pm) Shrimp and Oysters with Caviar;
Smoked Salmon, Smoked whitefish; fresh asparagus;
                         Spicy beef mini sandwiches; goat cheese with

5 bucks)

Also available are suites if need to stay the night.  Need to reserve the
suite with the Tribute at 972-370-5465.

Price???   Well Sherry did a great job negotiating this one because the
Tribute wanted to charge 140 and that did not include gratuity.  (Over 160?)
               Price is 100 which includes taxes and gratuity (but not the
DJ or suite if you plan on staying)

Need to know soon by December 22nd.  Call Sherry at 972-370-1881 or e-mail
her at champersgal@aol.com.

MJ,
How are you doing?  Things here are definitely  roller coaster status but
stablizing a bit!  How was your wine  tour?  I thought about you guys.
It looked like so much fun!   Elliot is thinking about having people come
to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I  was thinking about coming a day early or
leaving a day later (or maybe  both!)  I am thinking that you might be
out of town around there but  If you are around, I would like to get
together with you if it all works  out.  Let me know what you think!!
And I hope all is going well for  you!
Kim

Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

	In order to comply with FERC regulations regarding title to natural gas, Enron proposes to sell natural gas to Frito Lay at the Permian supply basin and act as agent to manage Frito Lay's TWPL transportation agreements. The agency agreement would authorize Enron to act on Frito Lay's behalf to optimize the use of the transportation agreements.

	Enron shall be paid the greater of a flat fee of $.00/mmbtu for all quantities delivered to the California border and consumed in Frito Lay's facilities or a percentage of

To the extent Enron can increase Frito Lay's profitablity by implementing alternative supply and transportation strategies, Enron proposes to retain ___% of any incremental value realized on the TWPL transportation agreements.

Kim:
I have completed the invoices for April, May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $3,615,910.62.  I am waiting to hear back from Patti on May and June to make sure they are okay with her.  Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August?  Again, I do not have all of the information for July and August, so I cannot give you any numbers.  If I go by what is currently in the system as a guide, Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $1 mil.  I need to forecast the money today, so please let me know what you would like to do.

FYI-I will be out of the office all next week.

Megan

Subject: New Years Eve Party

Sherry and Johnny Bains have put together a great package for the 31st at
the Tribute.  Time will be from 8:30 until 1:30 am.

Package details:

Valet service
2 blackjack tables manned by trained Vegas dealers
Special midnight countdown with champagne toast
Open Bar!!!
Two for 1 golf coupon at the Tribute (cost normally around 100 on weekends)
Menu to include (served between 9- 11:15 pm) Shrimp and Oysters with Caviar;
Smoked Salmon, Smoked whitefish; fresh asparagus;
                         Spicy beef mini sandwiches; goat cheese with
crackers; chef carved NY strip lion; filet of salmon with saffron risotto;
                          Supreme of chicken and sun dried tomato-cream

Midnight Buffet will include black-eyed peas, mustard greens, corn bread, &
assorted French pastries.

Other items will be a DJ and his cost will be divided up later (maybe around
5 bucks)

Also available are suites if need to stay the night.  Need to reserve the
suite with the Tribute at 972-370-5465.

Price???   Well Sherry did a great job negotiating this one because the
Tribute wanted to charge 140 and that did not include gratuity.  (Over 160?)
               Price is 100 which includes taxes and gratuity (but not the
DJ or suite if you plan on staying)

Need to know soon by December 22nd.  Call Sherry at 972-370-1881 or e-mail
her at champersgal@aol.com.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count. 
Please call Shirley Crenshaw at 3-5290 to register.

Subject:	MY citizens/griffith spreadsheet

Chris,

Attached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.  As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and John Cogans. the main issue is as follows:

1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.

I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.  I am working with Darla and Ann to get the orig granted.

thanks,

Kim

from rlclv..................


By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise and reports of the
destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US. These were deplorable
acts
that we will never forget. But now is a time to look at the other side of
the numbers coming out of New York, Washington and

Pennsylvania.

The sad but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream media has not
reported yet - the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about the attacks.

*** The Buildings ***

*The World Trade Center -

The twin towers of the World Trade Center were places of employment for
some
50,000 people. With the missing list of just over 5,000 people, that means
90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A 90% on a test is an 'A.'

* The Pentagon -

Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane aimed at the Pentagon.
The latest count shows that only 123 lost their lives. That is an amazing
99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to have come in too low,
too early to affect a large portion of the building. On top of that, the
section that was hit was the first of five sections to undergo renovations
that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist attacks. It had
recently
completed straightening and blast proofing, saving untold lives.  This
attack was sad, but a statistical failure.

*** The Planes ***

* American Airlines Flight 77

This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of the Pentagon could have
carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard. Luckily 78% of the seats
were empty.

* American Airlines Flight 11

This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people aboard, but only carried
92.
Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled.

* United Airlines Flight 175

Another Boeing 767 that could have seated 351 people only had 65 people on
board. Fortunately it was 81% empty.

* United Airlines Flight 93

This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting stories yet. The smallest
flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out of a possible 289 had
84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood up to the attackers and
thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a national landmark, saving
untold numbers of lives in the process.



*** In Summary ***

Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept
cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's a higher survival rate
than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplant
-
all common, survivable illnesses.

The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it's
strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade
Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate
sacrifice to save even more lives.

Don't fear these terrorists. The odds are against them.


GOD BLESS AMERICA

We worked together with them to develop the calculation, so it should be a quick process.  Based on your email below, it sounds like it's fine to move forward and submit a preliminary, indicative bid as long as the response includes the appropriate conditions and contingencies with regards to the Master Agreement.
 
Thanks for your help,
Kelli

Kim, Kelli and Jeff - 

I have taken a look at the Northern California Power Agency deal, and it looks pretty good from a credit standpoint.  We currently have some exposure to NCPA on the power side, but it rolls off by the end of the year, so I think that we can still get this deal done.  Some outstanding issues:

1.  We MUST have a Master Firm in place with NCPA to transact on this deal.  I can begin working on this, but I need to get NCPA's latest financial results to determine an appropriate collateral threshold for NCPA.  This shouldn't be a huge hurdle.

2.  We need to ask Jeff Hodge for his opinion with respect to NCPA transacting a deal of this tenor.  There are sometimes tenor limits placed on municipal entities to limit the term under which they are authorized to transact.  Jeff:  How do we research this issue?  NCPA has provided us a brief statement that indicates that "NCPA will work expeditiously to execute a definitive contract and has all the necessary approval authorities", but my feeling is that we need something a little more substantial than that.

3.  Kelli:  Have you spoken with Global Finance to price the embedded loan in this deal? 

4.  Kim:  I don't think a credit reserve will be needed on this deal. 

5.  Kim:  From the document that NCPA sent out, it appears that your Monday bid is preliminary and conditional.  We need to make sure that NCPA understands our requirements with respect to executing a Master.  Can your contact at NCPA help me get a copy of their latest financials so we can expedite that process?

6.  Kim:  ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  NCPA's credit ratings have remained solid throughout the California power crisis, for a number of reasons.  As such, I am pretty comfortable moving forward with this deal, given the above requirements.  However, if their financial results indicate some problems, we may need to include some stringent credit requirements in the Master.  I'm pretty sure that their results will look good, but this is a contingency to bear in mind as your prepare your bid.


Please give me a call with any questions.  Thanks, 


JRW

Market Summary (as of 12/31/2001 11:00 hours ET)  http://moneycentral.msn.com/articles/common/summary.asp

Quiet start for 2001 finale
Provided by MSN Money

A quiet session dawns as investors complete the worst stock-market year since the 1970s. The motivations to head home early seem to outweigh any inclination to trade. Exchanges closed for the day in Japan and most of Europe, the U.S. bond market wraps up at 1 p.m. ET and tomorrow, of course, is the New Year?s holiday.
<p>
Volume could be light today, CNBC?s Mary Thompson reports from the lightly staffed New York Stock Exchange.
<p>
Stocks started very slightly lower, despite a rise in futures before the opening bell. Consumer-products stocks, biotech firms and waste-management companies posted the biggest early declines -- though each sector was down less than 3% on the day.
<p>
Regardless of today's activity, 2001 will wind up a dismal stock-market year. The S&P 500 index, down about 12% in the past 12 months, will post its worst annual drop since 30% in 1974. And the Dow industrials will wrap up their first back-to-back yearly losses since 1977-78. Stocks have come back strongly since mid-September -- but not nearly enough to buff out the damage of the previous nine months.

Kim:

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kim: 
        I'm checking into a  PG&E citygate basis differential for the 4-months Dec.thru March off the  NYMEX for United Cogen in San Franscisco.  Right now, the 4-month  strip is about $3.03/dth. Whoops, make that $3.26/dth.
 
    Also, I'm checking  into a price for a 38 months firm gas supply at the Citygate to run from  6/1/03-7/31/06.  The volume would be in the 5,000-5,500 dth/day  range.  Everything at United was put on hold following the 9/11  disaster.  If you have any  questions, give me a call.  Is now a good time to buy Enron stock?   Hope you're all doing well.

Hey Miss Kim,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.... I got the invitation from Tricia and have been trying to swing going for to Chicago for the weekend. It's pretty expensive to get to Chicago from Portland (last week tickets were almost $500 but this weekend they were down to $350... not a lot of direct flights..... ugh). I have a trip to Green Bay (yes a Packer game planned for the weekend after, a trip to BCN around Thanksgiving and then was planning to go home for Christmas... so I'm not sure I can swing all of the expenses and time away from work (it's crazy.... working (or at least attempting to) on two big deals at once). I'm still trying to see if I can get a deal on the ticket and then was wondering too how expensive the Drake would be and when folks were planning to get there..grrr....

I do hope to make it to Houston sometime too! It would be great to see you and Vannie and some of my other Houston friends. Everytime I'm down there it seems I fly back in 24 hours or less, so I'm hoping to swing a trip with a bit more time. 

I'm so psyched that you and Pete are still hanging out! That's awesome!! He is a smart boy!

Alright, I'll let you know if I can swing the girl's weekend... it sounds like so much fun....Alright, I've got to run.. meetings galore and such today. I'm glad you're well!!

I'll be in touch soon!

ciao bella,
Laura

Hello again,

I talked to Mary Jo yesterday and exchanged emails with Tricia - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.  If Tricia didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I.  How does that look for you?  I can get a ticket right now for $188.  

I do wish you would come down here with Jeff sometime.  Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!  Jeff could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!

Yes - I am still hanging out with Pete.  Things are good. He is very nice and lots of fun! 

Keep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!

Love, Kim

Hey Miss Kim,

I'm glad that you're doing well. Crazy world we live in now... scary!! Tricia Tlapek sent me an e-mail... it looks like she may try and organize a girl's get together w/ Mary Jo - it would GREAT fun to meet up with you there!!!

Jeff's traveling a lot less than he was... I'm sure he'll be down to Houston again in the not-too-distant future though. I'll try and swing a weekend at some point when he's down there - it would be fun to meet up in Houston too!

I'm glad to hear from you and looking forward to meeting up with you soon. Are you still hanging out with Pete??? 

I hope you're well! Miss you!!!

Laura,

Just wanted to drop you a note to see how things are with you.  With the things that happened a couple of weeks ago, our travel has been put off for a while.  I am still trying to plan a trip to N. Cali - perhaps in October sometime.  Since my Aruba trip has been cancelled, I have a little more time.  I will keep you posted and hopefully you would still like to visit Mary Jo and perhaps the spa or wine country.  Maybe we can get Vanny out there with us!  

Is Jeff still traveling back and forth alot?  The weather here just got a big break and it is very cool outside.  How is it there?  My favorite month in Portland is October, with the trees changing colors.  Anyway - must get back to work.  Talk to you soon!

Kim

Art, 
We have priced these at the money puts and they are kind of expensive.  For 
the monthly put, Strike of $2.72, premium would be $.495.  For the Daily 
put, the premium would be $.535.  Let me know if you have any questions. 
Prices might be lower tomarrow given the downturn since AGA's came out.  If 
you are willing to look at out of the money puts, the price would be better 
as well. 
Thanks, 
Kim

Hey Kim,

Hope all is well.  You have been on my mind a lot so I thought I would try to
get in touch with you.  I am now back at home after taking a severance
package with Kraft.  Sept. 6, we had a new addition to the family...Don...who
is so sweet and big.

Are you going to Memphis over the holidays?  I would love to get together!

Take care and let me hear from you!

Much love,

Yonnie

Wow!  sorry to hear about all that.  i didn't even know you were dating
someone, i am way out of the loop.  whoever he was is obviously a fucking
idiot.  i've told you before my opinions of you and i'll tell you again
anytime.  you do have a lot going on but look at it this way, it can only
get better from here.  i might still try and come to houston, just not sure.
will let you know.  hope everything gets better for you....

Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an
earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my
company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am
broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my
ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when
it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I
am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone
to take over at this point - - - -

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple
of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have
told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is
still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge
way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going
to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will
survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry
to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for
you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash
crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who
knows!

Keep in touch -
K.

k,


thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you
are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week
ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....

Jim:

Here is a term sheet for gas supply.  Prices are up quite a bit today.  The fixed price is about $3.30/MMBtu.  Recognize that it is very volatile right now, however, and prices could be back down tomorrow.  

I am still working with EES to se if they want to submit an offer.

Hey Miss Kim,

I'm glad that you're doing well. Crazy world we live in now... scary!! Tricia Tlapek sent me an e-mail... it looks like she may try and organize a girl's get together w/ Mary Jo - it would GREAT fun to meet up with you there!!!

Jeff's traveling a lot less than he was... I'm sure he'll be down to Houston again in the not-too-distant future though. I'll try and swing a weekend at some point when he's down there - it would be fun to meet up in Houston too!

I'm glad to hear from you and looking forward to meeting up with you soon. Are you still hanging out with Pete??? 

I hope you're well! Miss you!!!

Laura,

Just wanted to drop you a note to see how things are with you.  With the things that happened a couple of weeks ago, our travel has been put off for a while.  I am still trying to plan a trip to N. Cali - perhaps in October sometime.  Since my Aruba trip has been cancelled, I have a little more time.  I will keep you posted and hopefully you would still like to visit Mary Jo and perhaps the spa or wine country.  Maybe we can get Vanny out there with us!  

Is Jeff still traveling back and forth alot?  The weather here just got a big break and it is very cool outside.  How is it there?  My favorite month in Portland is October, with the trees changing colors.  Anyway - must get back to work.  Talk to you soon!

Kim

Jeff,

A 10 year fixed price indication at the PG&E City Gate out of Jan. 02 is
approximately $3.32.  I hope this is helpful.  Let me know how I can help
facilitate the blend with Merced.

Let me know if there is any thing else that you need.

thanks,

Kim

Kim,  can you help Merced out with a 10-year PG&E city-gate price assuming
a  1/1/2002 start (see message below).  I'll get them the electricity
price.  Indicative price is fine.  We are not going to  transact.

Got  your message too about gas prices moving up.  We are still looking at
the  blend/extend versus an outright swap of the last almost 3 years.  I'll
be  in touch.

Thanks  for your help.

Do you  have on hand data on natural gas futures for 10 years
and  Electric Prices projected for 10 years.
If  Available we can use them this morning.   I know the lead time
Is short  but would appreciate any help you can  provide.

so glad to hear from you and h glad you weren't galavanting around the country somewhere.  I just don't know what to think about all this stuff.   it's like emotional overload.   so so awful. 
 i am really not a happy camper right now.  with life, jeff, job and kids.   don't know what to do about it either.   i really think that if jeff would just give it up and please leave me alone it would really really help. 
 i am glad your friend mike wasn't in ny.  my bosses wife was in washington dc  they were staying 3 blocks from the capital.  he came back on monday, she had a meeting until tues.  she still isn't home.  she and 2 doctors she was with finally rented a car and are on their way back.  there are so many stories.  i don;t think ther is one single person who has not been affected by this.  
  any way   hugs and kisses   glad you are safe.     ang

Hi Kim,

Just wanted to say, well I don't really know what to say.  For what its
worth, you guys are the sharpest group of traders and one of the most
innovative companies I have ever dealt with.  You'll find a way through
this.

If you need to reschedule our meeting Tuesday evening I completely
understand.

Thanks,

Kim, Kelli and Jeff -

I have taken a look at the Northern California Power Agency deal, and it looks pretty good from a credit standpoint.  We currently have some exposure to NCPA on the power side, but it rolls off by the end of the year, so I think that we can still get this deal done.  Some outstanding issues:

1.  We MUST have a Master Firm in place with NCPA to transact on this deal.  I can begin working on this, but I need to get NCPA's latest financial results to determine an appropriate collateral threshold for NCPA.  This shouldn't be a huge hurdle.

2.  We need to ask Jeff Hodge for his opinion with respect to NCPA transacting a deal of this tenor.  There are sometimes tenor limits placed on municipal entities to limit the term under which they are authorized to transact.  Jeff:  How do we research this issue?  NCPA has provided us a brief statement that indicates that "NCPA will work expeditiously to execute a definitive contract and has all the necessary approval authorities", but my feeling is that we need something a little more substantial than that.

3.  Kelli:  Have you spoken with Global Finance to price the embedded loan in this deal?

4.  Kim:  I don't think a credit reserve will be needed on this deal.

5.  Kim:  From the document that NCPA sent out, it appears that your Monday bid is preliminary and conditional.  We need to make sure that NCPA understands our requirements with respect to executing a Master.  Can your contact at NCPA help me get a copy of their latest financials so we can expedite that process?

6.  Kim:  ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:  NCPA's credit ratings have remained solid throughout the California power crisis, for a number of reasons.  As such, I am pretty comfortable moving forward with this deal, given the above requirements.  However, if their financial results indicate some problems, we may need to include some stringent credit requirements in the Master.  I'm pretty sure that their results will look good, but this is a contingency to bear in mind as your prepare your bid.


Please give me a call with any questions.  Thanks,


JRW

Kim-
Here is the August spreadsheet.  These are the changes I've made so far:

I changed the formula in column R
I added in the new contracts for August

The differences between my model and the invoice are the way that they calculate the actual gas flow to Malin (column L on mine and column Z on theirs);

It also appears that they do not include the Redwood credit.

Looking at my model now, I also don't remember what the calculation in column D is for.  It seems kind of unnecessary to me and doesn't make much sense.

I know this is a lot of stuff to look at.  If you don't understand what I just wrote, ask me and I'll explain what I'm trying to say.
Thanks,
Mara

Barry,

Interstate Gas Services, on behalf of the DWR, will be soliciting bids for
gas supply.  We are currently contemplating limited gas purchases, and would
like to get a GISB in place.  We would like to do a quick follow up in
regards to the status of the GISB contract between yourselves and the
Department of Water Resources.  If your legal department has any questions
or concerns, please contact Mark Baldwin of Interstate Gas Services at
925-243-0350.

To address any credit concerns you may have, the department is currently
preparing a complete credit package which we will forward to you upon its
completion.

Again, please do not hesitate to call.

Thank You,
Brenda Buxa

OK, just talked to LP

We are going to meet up later with his Aunt & Uncle (very fun people) and he and Cher around 9pm.  I have to go to a happy hour for Tosha's departure at 5:30 at Tealas.  You are welcome to come if you like.  

Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.  A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.  We are planning to go around lunch time.  That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.  Are you in??  I hope so.

If you need a silly laugh in the midst of the
holiday rush, these are great.


 Wonder about those people who spend $2.00 apiece on
 those little bottles of Evian water? Try spelling Evian
 backwards. NAIVE

 Isn't making a smoking section in a restaurant like
making a peeing section in a swimming pool?

 OK...so if the Jacksonville Jaguars are known as the
"Jags" and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers are known as the
 "Bucs", what does that make the Tennessee Titans ?

 If 4 out of 5 people SUFFER from diarrhea... does
that mean that one enjoys it?

 There are three religious truths:
 1. Jews do not recognize Jesus as the Messiah.
 2. Protestants do not recognize the Pope as
     leader of the Christian faith.
3. Baptists do not recognize each other in the
     liquor store or at Hooters

 Why do we say something is out of whack?
 What's a whack?

 Do infants enjoy infancy as much as adults enjoy adultery?

 If love is blind, why is lingerie so popular?

 Why is the man who invests all your money called a broker?

Why do croutons come in airtight packages? Aren't
 they just stale bread to begin with?

If lawyers are disbarred and clergymen defrocked,
 doesn't it follow that electricians can be delighted, musicians
denoted, cowboys deranged, models  deposed,
 tree surgeons debarked, and dry cleaners depressed?

 Do Lipton Tea employees take coffee breaks?

 What hair color do they put on the driver's licenses
 of bald men?

 I thought about how mothers feed their babies with
 tiny little spoons and forks so I wondered what do
 Chinese mothers use?  Toothpicks?

 Why do they put pictures of criminals up in the Post
 Office? What are we  supposed to do, write to them?
Why don't they just put their pictures on the postage stamps
so the mailmen can look for them while they deliver the mail?

 If it's true that we are here to help others, then
 what exactly are the others here for?

 You never really learn to swear until you learn to
 drive.

Kim:  Everything on the list is complete.  You were granted $11,500 tonight.  I have been working with Darla to make sure that John Cogan has been paid each month.  We are caught up on his payments.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks

Hey....I am sad...we will not come home until Christmas Day.  Will you back
after that?  I would love to spend some time with you!

How is Houston?  I know you liked it there before but had grown to love the
west.  Are you looking anywhere special for a job?...like Memphis?

Have you heard from any one who worked in the World Trade Center?  Of course,
I thought immediately of visiting your workplace there.  It was unbelievably
horrible!

Talk to you soon....I am so glad we are e-mailing!

Love ya,

Yonnie

As a reminder, our TW capacity release deal with Citizens expires at the end of the month.  We need to do a new capacity release deal to obtain it again through 10/2003.  It is my understanding that Craig Ludtke will be posting it or has already done so.  Please make sure you communicate with Craig so this happens.  Otherwise, we will have problems on the 1st.

Kim:  Sounds like you're confused.  ENA is requiring two opinions:  one from Glendale (inhouse) and another which we are paying for (Glendale's outside counsel)  Call me.  Please do not forward my messages to Glendale because we are now at cross purposes.  There is no need to alarm Glendale about our existing arrangements.  Sara

No room on the LC's and they would have to be on the higher side. A more detailed look at their performance showed that they have not had a great year at all. Their equity has continued to erode.

Talked to them this morning and refreshed the basis numbers down a bit.  Told them about the LC requirements and they puked but didn't say that it was over.  If this deal doesn't get done today, it won't get done because we will have to add them to our Socal Pool on Monday.  Any room on the LC's?  They asked.  I think if we didn't ask them to post, they would do the deal.
