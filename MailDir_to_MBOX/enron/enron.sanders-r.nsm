Attached is a draft of Mike Swartz's motion to start the process of 
compelling Kevin McConville to testify by deposition in Houston.? Although we 
might quarrel with some of the things that Swartz says, the motion is certain 
to be granted.? However, Swartz will drop the deposition, if McConville will 
give him an interview and promise to appear at trial, if asked.

Tom Hatch is also pressing me about whether we will grant other plaintiffs an 
interview with McConville. 

Please call me, so we can discuss this.? If we can make a deal with the 
plaintiffs, it would be better to do so before they start filing papers that 
the other defendants will see and wonder about if the papers are later 
withdrawn.

Richard,

Here are rough transcripts of the first five days of Schultes' deposition, 
which is now in its sixth day.? The lawyers are getting worn down, and 
Schultes grows stronger every day.? Many lawyers in the room believe Schultes 
to be the most impressive deposition witness they have ever seen.

Enron needs a day (maybe less) of your time, hopefully this week.

We have to submit our proposed exhibits on July 3, 2001.  I am leaving for
Peru on Sunday 6/17, not returning until 7/6 (after the list is due, unless
the final status conference changes).

I have gone through my high priority documents and listed potential exhibits. I would like you to come out to our offices and go thru (1) the accordions of
key docs that you put together earlier this year and (2) all of the deposition
exhibits, to see what should be added to my list.

I am not trying to pack our list.  In fact I would like NOT to list (a) any
document that we are sure one or more of the other parties will submit (e.g.,
I haven't put any of the offering memos or road show slides on the list) or
(b) any document that contains anything negative for us, unless there is also
something very positive in the document that we really need (e.g., I haven't
listed Brian's memo re topics for Management Company discussion or any of the
work by the Enron auditors in August-September 1998.)

The reason that I would like you to do this work this week is so that I can
discuss any questions you come up with before I leave.  I will be in traveling
and in NY on Tues-Thurs, but you can come here on any of those days; I'll be
back in the office on Friday (6/15); we could talk out any questions then.

Let me know what you can do.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ................................................

Kathy concluded her questioning today and continued to focus on 
engineering/management problems with the mill. Highlights:

--As configured, Nolan felt that the mill could not produce 1.35 million 
metric tons as projected in the Offering Memo.? Nolan felt that a more 
accurate number was 1 million metric tons.

--The static var controller (electricity related) was struck by lightening 
resulting in the mill being shut down for about 3 months.? If NSM had money 
for spare parts, a new SVC could have been purchased.

--Nothing prevented SDI personnel from checking the engineering of the plant 
before the offering. 

Cory Gordon of Robins, Kaplan began is questioning late this afternoon.? 
Gordon went straight to the off-take agreements.? Apparently SDI had its own 
off-take agreement with Pruessag that contained the type of language which 
was described in the offering memo-- i.e., Pruessag was obligated to purchase 
a guaranteed amount of steel at certain qualities each month/year.? By 
contrast the NSM/Pruessag off-take agreement did not impose any such 
obligation on Pruessag.? (Gordon will contiue with this area tomorrow)

Enron/ECT was not mentioned much today.

Cory Gordon concluded his examination on Friday.? Highlights: 

--The NSM/Pruessag Off-Take Agreements did not contain any tonnage and/or 
quality requirements. 

--Part of the offering proceeds ($3 million) were mysteriously paid to an 
entity called Rowlyn Investments.? The disbursement was approved by Shultes.? 
Nolan had no knowledge of the payment or the entity.

--NSM purchased its scrap from Suntech -- a company not surprisingly 
controlled by Swasdi. 

--Nolan learned of SDI's termination after the letter had been sent by 
Busse.? Nolan was surprised and shocked to see the letter.? Nolan believes 
that the plant can be salvaged and will "make a lot of money for someone" in 
the future.

Swartz began his examination late afternoon and tried to get Nolan focused on 
the two days prior to the Oct. 13 Bondholders' meeting.? Swartz asked Nolan 
about the source of the cash flow numbers presented to the bondholders.? 
Nolan generally deferred all questions concerning the cash/expenditure 
numbers to Stickler and Heasley.? Swartz did not ask questions about 
ECT/Enron although he did inquire whether Kevin McConville was generally 
accessible to Nolan.? Nolan stated that while he worked more closely with 
Stickler, Ari Levy and Heasly, McConville was responsive.

Michael Tomaino was the only defense counsel to ask questions.? Tomaino 
focused on the problems SDI had with its start up phase and the depressed 
nature of the East Asian steel market in 1998.? Nolan stated that the 
operational and quality problems NSM faced were identical to those faced by

The deposition of the first Farallon witness is plowing forward.  The witness
is quite good; even NatWest's counsel agrees.

I should get on tomorrow.

Here is a report on today (which repeated a lot from yesterday.)

Subject:	John W. Schultes v. McDonald Investments, etal

Bonnie, Jim Studdert has assigned me the lawsuit of John W. Schultes v. McDonald Investments, etal., wherein ENA and ECT Thailand are named defendants.

I have reviewed the lawsuit and have determined there is an obligation to defend this entire matter given the allegations associated with "Personal injury", which means injury, other than "bodily injury", arising out of oral or written publication of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person's or organization's goods, products or services, and/or oral or written publication of material that violates a person's right of privacy.

A review of the Complaint indicates there are allegations associated with Defamation Per Se, Defamation Per Quod, and Invasion of Privacy.  All of the other allegations are predicated on "intentional" conduct/activity, which would not constitute an "occurrence" which has resulted in "bodily injury" or "property damage".  Thus, while we will defend the entire lawsuit, we will only contribute to a settlement or respond to an award for damages associated with the aforementioned counts, assuming such were not made with knowledge of their falsity.

I note suit was filed on February 22, 2001.  As such, please immediately provide me with the following for our file:

*	The identity of defense counsel and a copy of the Engagement Agreement which was provided to them (please include copies of all required monthly billing statements which they have submitted thus far so we can consider reimbursement to the operating company from the date we were first given notice of this matter).
*	Provide a copy of the Answer and any other pleadings filed to-date.
*	Have defense counsel provide their analysis of our alleged exposure, if not done already.
*     Advise who is the assigned ELU Legal Assistant assigned to this matter so we can advise them to copy us on all correspondence going forward.

Following receipt of the above, it may be a good idea to meet and discuss this matter.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks,

Richard, earlier today I spoke with Barry Friedberg, Schultes' New York 
counsel to get some idea of what areas Schultes' Ohio counsel would be 
interested in during tomorrow's discussion.? Friedberg explained that the 
Ohio counsel are "classic plaintiff's lawyers" - they are not that familiar 
with the issues and will tend to ask broad generalized questions.? Friedberg 
also noted that they may be unaware that Enron is a defendant in the two 
California actions and will likely be unaware that Enron is the only 
defendant who has not cross-complained against Schultes. For purposes of 
insuring that any deposition testimony in the Ohio case is not used against 
any defendant in the bondholders' litigation,? Friedberg thought it would be 
a good idea to try a limit any discussion to post-closing events and, more 
specifically, whether Enron personnel were privy to any discussions with SDI 
or McDonald regarding (1) the decision to fire Schultes, (2) Schultes' 
alleged dishonesty and (3) Schultes' alleged incompetence.? Friedberg 
explained that Busse's defenses to the defamation and wrongful termination 
claims are (1) that he did not make any defamatory statements and (2) if he 
did, they were true.? The problem with the second defense is that it may 
affect our defenses in the bondholders' litigation.? If Enron or others were 
aware that Schultes was dishonest or incompetent it will be important to know 
when and how they learned of such information.? Ideally, they learned it 
after the closing and only through discussions between McDonald and SDI.

I received a telephone call from Schultes' attorney requesting that we make 
Barth, McConville, and the two analysts who went to Thailand available for 
depositions. Schultes' atty's names are Bill Redmond 440-893-0338 and Joel 
Levin 216-928-0600. They have a discovery deadline in Oct. I tried to talk 
them out of it but they insisted. I instead suggested a telephone interview 
with limited depositions to follow. Please call me Tues about this.

I understand from Cleary Gottlieb (counsel for the bondholders steering 
committee) that various objections have been filed to the claims filed in the 
Thai bankruptcy proceedings.? Apparently the committee has objected to some 
claims, including claims filed by the Thai banks, and the Thai banks have 
filed objections to others, including the claims filed by Chase as indenture 
trustee. The lawyer at Cleary did not know whether any objections to Enron's 
claim had been filed, but is trying to track down a list of all of the 
objections and send it to me.

Have you received notice of any objections to Enron's claims?? I would also 
be interested in any information you might be able to obtain regarding other 
significant objections.? Cleary indicates that the Thai bankruptcy court will 
be conducting hearings on the claims objections from late September through 
the end of October.? Could you please provide confirmation or an update 
regarding that process?

Thank you.? I hope all is well.

Looks like NatWest's cross-complaint against Farallon's fund managers may 
hold up at the pleading stage.? See below. 

-----Original Message----- 
From:?? Bhalla, Sabina 
Sent:?? Friday, September 22, 2000 12:03 PM 
To:???? Howard, Steve 
Subject:??????? Farallon Demurrer hearing 

This morning I attended the hearing on Cross-Defendants demurrer to Natwest's 
Cross-Complaint.? The judge permitted extensive oral argument from Bruce 
MacLoed representing Farallon and Oaktree, and Jim Wines representing 
Natwest.? 

Judge Berle was extremely active in asking questions to each party.? He was 
primarily concerned with the relationship between the fund managers and 
Oaktree and Farallon, and whether that was a fiduciary relationship, and if 
so, what level of fiduciary duty was owed (he seemed inclined to leave this 
issue for summary judgment).? The Cross-Defendants argued that if this suit 
was to go forward, it would create a disincentive for fund managers to report 
fraud, since the? fund managers may ultimately be personally liable.? 

Judge Berle asked Natwest if this was more of an affirmative defense instead 
of a cross claim, which was being used to diminish Plaintiffs complaint.? 
Natwest stated that the fiduciaries were liable for not investigating.? 
Farallon/Oaktree admitted that it has imputed any negligence and actual 
knowledge from the fund managers to itself, and that Defendants are entitled 
to an offset.? Interestingly, Plaintiffs stated that the fund managers were 
damaged themselves, since they did not receive a bonus etc.?? 

The Judge seemed inclined to permit a demurrer to the contribution cause of 
action, since Natwest did not really defend that cause of action separate 
from the indemnity action.? 

Natwest pointed to a case Platt v. Coldwell Banker 217 Cal. App.3d 1439, 
which Natwest claimed, allows the fund managers to be sued independently.? A 
cross action is permitted if the Plaintiffs could have brought the same 
claims against the fund managers, and Natwest argued that the Plaintiffs 
could have brought such a claim.? Finally, Natwest said it would be 
prejudiced if it could not "point the finger" at the highly paid investement 
manager.? According to the Platt case, a nonparty witness is very different 
than a potential indemnitor who is sitting at the table at trial.?? 

??? 
The judge said his ruling would occur before Oct. 10.? Legg Mason 
Cross-Defendants have until that time to file a response to the 
cross-complaint (that was what the ex parte application was about).

I would like to send the following e-mail to Oaktree's lawyer.  What do you
think?

My points are not directly responsive to the prior e-mail, but I think this
gives us a hook to assert a position that you and I have discussed but never
actually asserted.

Steve

................................................

Bruce,

I am a little late answering your attached e-mail.

Brian Barth met with Mike Swartz in the first half of 2000 in his capacity as
counsel for Oaktree and in the context of Oaktree's written agreement, and
Mike's oral agreement, that Oaktree's counsel would not disclose to, or use
for, Farallon anything learned from Barth in the meeting (which meeting
Oaktree insisted take place pursuant to the parties' written agreement.)

In direct violation of the written and oral agreements, Shawna Ballard
thereafter disclosed the Barth/Swartz meeting on the public record in Barth's
deposition and began asserting statements in the deposition that Brian had
allegedly made to Mike.  (Shawna's factual assertions about what Brian said
were in fact wrong, but that is beside the point.)  Until Shawna made her
disclosures, none of the defendants was even aware that the meeting had taken
place.  Now, as a result of Shawna's disclosures, in a variety of ways the
other defendants have initiated formal and informal discovery against Enron
and are otherwise taking positions adverse to Enron.  Enron intends to hold
Oaktree responsible for all damages arising out of its breach of its written
agreement with Enron, including Enron's substantially increased attorneys fees
in the various litigations.



>>> "MacLeodB@hbdlawyers.com" 04/04/01 03:18PM >>>
Steve -- I am having a little trouble understanding the complaints stated in
your two e-mails repeated below.

With regard to the Barth deposition, Section 2.01 of the parties'
cooperation agreement expressly authorizes Oaktree to reveal information
obtained from ECT to potential witnesses or even as exhibits in depositions.

With regard to our document production, Section 2.01 again specifically
authorizes us to provide documents or information obtained from ECT in
responding to discovery requests.  Moreover, we know of no know proper
privilege objection that would have allowed us to withhold any of the
materials we have produced in response to NatWest's subpoena.  Our production 
in response to NatWest's subpoena is substantially complete.
If, after you have reviewed that production, you continue to believe that we
are in error with regard to the Oaktree/ECT agreement or the proper scope of
our production, give me a call and we discuss it.  Thanks Steve.

I just reviewed this pleading.  Before you produce any docs responsive to
Request No 1, I would like the opportunity to review the docs.

We believe that Oaktree breached its agreement with Enron when Shawna
disclosed in the middle of Barth's deposition that Mike Swartz had met with
Barth and further disclosed (inaccurately, we believe) portions of the

of that meeting.  We would hope that Oaktree is not on the verge of a

I have just spoken at length with Richard Smith regarding certain of the 
concerns raised in the e-mail below.? Richard's main concerns were as follows:

1.? As to filing of a claim for equity interests held, Richard indicates that 
this is not common practice and there may not be any provision for it in Thai 
bankruptcy law.? The claims to be filed are "applications for debt 
repayment", which are intended to set forth a fixed sum of which the creditor 
seeks payment.? Given the nature of equity investments, they do not really 
fit into the governing Thai bankruptcy law provisions.? Richard is following 
up with his Thai partner to further explore this issue, and I will be 
speaking with both of them later today.

2.? As to the contingent indemnification claims, Richard advises that the 
"application for debt repayment" must state a claim in a fixed amount.? 
Again, he is going to consult with his Thai partner on this issue, but his 
suggested approach is to file the claims as follows:? (1) with respect to the 
pending litigation, in the face amount of the claims asserted against the 
defendants (as an approximation of the potential maximum exposure); and (2) 
with respect to any potential litigation, in the total face amount of the 
bond issuances (also as an approximation of potential maximum exposure).? Two 
areas of greater uncertainty are any claims for legal fees and/or punitive 
damages, which obviously are not readily quantifiable.

I will keep you advised of our further discussions on these issues.?

Subject: NSM - Claim Filing 

We write further to our telephone discussion with Deb Korkmas this evening 
(our time) in relation to the above matter. 

As discussed during the course of our telephone discussion, there are a 
number of outstanding issues that, bearing in mind the 12 hour time 
difference between Bangkok and you and the deadline of the claim submission 
which is on Monday 7 August, we would require them to be settled by Friday. 

1.????? Claim amounts 
We note from the documentation so far received by us and your e-mail 
yesterday that the following entities will claim under the following 
agreements: 

1.1???? Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the principal amount 
outstanding and the interest outstanding for the Notes under the Security 
Purchase Agreement, Indenture and Guarantee.? We would appreciate it if this 
could be confirmed and also the definite amount of principal and interest 
that is to be claimed. 

1.2???? Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the shares (equity), 
as listed in the Shareholders Agreement, held by it in NSM.? However, having 
reviewed the documentation so far received by us we are unsure as to the 
legal grounds under which Enron North America Corp is entitled to claim this 
sum.? Could you please clarify the nature of this claim. 

1.3???? ECT Thailand Investment Inc. wishes to claim for the shares 
(equity), as listed in the Securities Purchase Agreement, held by it in NSM. 
However, as in 1.2 above, having reviewed the documentation received by us 
we are unsure as to the legal grounds under which ECT Thailand Investment 
Inc is entitled to claim this sum.? Could you please clarify the nature of 
this claim. 

1.4???? ECT Securities Limited Partnership wishes to claim for any 
contingent liability that they may be subject to as a result of the 
litigation undertaken by Farallon Capital, et al. and Legg Mason Income 
Trust, Inc., et al.? As discussed, the sums which are allowed to be claimed 
have to be fixed sums as of the date on which the court granted an order to 
reorganise NSM's business, i.e. 8 May 2000.? It would appear to us that, 
asides from the legal fee sums, an exact sum for the contingent liabilities 
cannot be ascertained at this time. I would, therefore, appreciate 
clarification of how this is to be determined, otherwise the claim amount 
may have to be the full potential liabilities as claimed in the two 
litigation cases. 

2.????? Documentation 
As discussed, we also require the following documentation which we 
understand will be faxed to us during the course of today. 

2.1???? Corporate documents of the 3 entities making claims 
2.2???? Evidence of the change in the entities name if different from the 
name in the relevant agreements 
2.2???? Debenture Certificate (either global or definitive) 
2.3???? Evidence of the payment purchase price 
2.4???? A copy of the Notice of the Event of Default or demand letters as 
sent by the Trustee (if any) 
2.5???? The "Definition and Rules of Usage" as defined in the Shareholders 
Agreement (in addition, we do not know whether your claims in relation to 
the Shareholders Agreement are related to certain documents as described 
therein, e.g. Management Agreement, Enron Purchase Agreement, if they are 
related, we would require copies of such agreements as well) 
2.6???? Tables setting out all amounts (i.e. principal, interest, expenses, 
etc.) being claimed by the 3 claiming entities 

As mentioned in our discussion, in order to complete the application on time 
we would really need to have everything in place by Friday, given the 
deadline of the claim submission is on Monday, 7 August.? We would, 
therefore, appreciate it if you could reply to all of the above outstanding 
issues by today (your time) so that if there are any further outstanding 
issues we can try and clarify these during the course of tomorrow (our time) 
and perhaps during the weekend.? You may either respond to this email or 
alternatively call my mobile phone (661) 619 1262 or Richard Smith's mobile 
phone (661) 611 1184. 

Best regards 

Pichitphon Eammongkolchai / Richard Smith

Rich Tucker says his firm works for Legg Mason and might be a problem.  Do you
recall the name of the lawyer (and law firm) for Legg Mason whom you met with
in Washington ??  If he's with Reed Smith, Tucker is out.  If he's not with
Reed Smith, maybe we can proceed.

Richard,

At an earliier time in the NSM cases, I thought that we might argue that Enron
simply had nothing to do with the A and B bond offerings, that ECT Securities'
name appeared on the cover but Enron did nothing else.

Whether or not that would be a good position to take, it is clear to me that
the evidence will not support it. Enron did a great deal of diligence starting
in June of 1997 and continuing well after it became an "underwriter" in
November 1997 (after which, among other things, Enron received and commented
on drafts of the offering documents and road show slides.)  While we could
argue that we were only looking out for ourselves, I have no confidence that a
jury would buy that; and, in any event, I think it would be very unattractive
for us to say that we put our name on the cover just to get a fee and never
did anything at all to fullfill the duties of an underwriter.

Instead I think we should contend that Enron did a hell of a lot of work on
this transaction, looking into many differesnt aspects of the deal, that Enron
believed what it found and was told, that Enron asked a lot of questions of
Schultes, Healsey, Stickler, and Busse, that Enron believed and relied on
them, and that Enron invested $30 million of its own money (more than the
plaintiffs) because Enron sincerely believed in the deal..  We know now that
some of the things in the offering documents and road show slides were not
right, but Enron learned that only five or six months after the investors,
including Enron, put their money in.

On the basis of our meetings, I have asked Brian to take some time to put down
on paper an itemization of what Enron did to investigate the NSM transaction. 
A preliminary draft is attached.  I have asked Brian to go back and add names
of Enron and outside people involved in each of the analyses or investigations
that he has listed.

Claim in NSM bankruptcy

I am attaching for reference a copy of an e-mail sent to us today by Wilailuk 
Okanurak of Linklaters in Thailand. 

Ms. Okanurak refers to three potential claims--one based on Enron's equity 
position/purchase, one based on the management agreement, and one based on 
litigation/indemnification.? As I understand Ms. Okanurak's e-mail, she is 
asking Milbank for assistance with the third of the three claims; and we will 
provide it.? If you want us to assist Ms. Okanurak in any other respect, 
please let us know.

With respect to the litigation/indemnification claim, Sabina Bhallah in our 
Los Angeles office has spoken with Ms. Okanurak by telephone tonight and is 
faxing her (1) a copy of the 3/2/98 Purchase Agreement between NSM and the 
four Initial Purchasers, on which any contractual indemnity claim by Enron or 
any of its affiliates would be based, and (2) copies of the complaints in all 
of the U.S. litigations, including the two in CA that name ECT Securities, 
i.e., the litigations against which Enron asserts a claim for 
indemnification.? In addition, I will draft a narrative description of the 
litigation/indemnification claim for use by Ms. Okanurak.? I will send you 
all a draft as soon as I have it.

Everyone needs to think very carefully about what entity asserts each claim 
and against what entity.? (There are at least three "NSM's--the publicly 
owned Thai company, its wholly owned, Cayman Islands subsidiary, and the 
Cayman Islands company's wholly owned Delaware subsidiary.)? The 
litigation/indemnification claim is owned by ECT Securities Corp. or whatever 
entity has succeeded ECT Securities Corp.? ECT Securities Corp. is the party 
to all of the relevant documents; but plaintiffs at least believe that that 
entity has been succeeded by something called ECT Securities Limited 
Partnership.? Lisa and Richard will need to tell me the precise corporate 
history here.

Similarly, it looks to me like the owner of the equity claim is ECT Thailand 
Investments, Inc.--that entity at least is the party to the Shareholders 
Agreement with NSM.

I don't know who owns the claim under the management agreement, because, 
frankly, I don't understand that claim. 

Finally, some questions: 

Why isn't some Enron entity making a straight collection claim under the C 
notes, or did Enron sell those to Oaktree along with the Bs?

Similarly, shouldn't the appropriate Enron entity assert a fraud claim in 
connection with its purchase of the B and C notes to parallel the equity 
claim referred to by Ms. Okanurak, which I assume is basically a fraud claim 
in connection with Enron's purchase of equity from NSM and some of its 
principal shareholders.

I am in deposition in NY tomorrow but will call my voicemail hourly.? Sabina

Based on our discussion last week, here is some information under the 
Lackawanna letter of credit.  Under the letter of credit, the stated amount 
is increased $4.5 million upon receipt from the trustee of notification of 
the Completion Date.  Completion Date is defined in the LC as in the 
Indenture.  However, this definition is exactly the same as used in the 
subordinated loan agreement.  I have attached my analysis of the requirements 
for the Completion Date under the Loan Agreement.

Completion requires, among other things, the production within a 24 day 
period of 3,000 units with certain quality specifications.  Approval of these 
specifications must be made by the independent engineer.  To date, we have 
taken a wait and see approach regarding completion.  Please review and advise 
on your thoughts on strategy going forward.  Obviously, we want to hold them 
to the letter of the agreement.  The LC expires on June 30 and it does not 
appear that under the loan agreement that we are required to fund after the 
expiration of the letter of credit.

If you need the pertinent documents, I have them in my office.

Farallon is seeking leave to file an amended complaint.? No effect on us.? 
Several claims added against McDonald and NatWest.? We'll send you a copy.

Have you found out from Brian whether he wants to go 1/17, 18, and possibly 
19 or 1/18, 19, and possibly 20?

Richard: 

Mike Swartz was the sole questioner of Busse on Friday.? He focused primarily 
on the theme that the offering memorandum misreprested the use of proceeds 
(which, in hindsight we know, it certainly did--i.e., unscheduled pay offs of 
bank debt and lots of previously unscheduled fees.)

Neither Swartz nor any other questioner asked about the off-take agreements 
(though those agreements are featured in nearly all of the complaints.)

Swartz asked loosely if there were any Enron people at the roadshows, and 
Busse answered yes.? So I asked a few questions--brought out that only Brian 
ever attended any road shows and that he did not speak.

Roland will be in Fort Wayne next week for Nolan's depo and will continue on 
to New York for Izowar's depo (White & Case) on Friday, 7/21.? I will cover 
Goldstein (Oaktree) in LA on Wednesday.? We are going to skip a 
NatWest/personal jurisdiction deposition in New York on Tuesday.

Schultes will be deposed in NY during the week of 7/31.

Subject:??????? RE: ECT Securities : Indemnity claim 

Dear Mr. Ngodngam: 

I very much like your idea of ECT's amending its claim to add a "condition" 
to the claim to accommodate W&C's position about the unenforceability of 
indemnity agreements vis-a-vis certain types of securities claims and not 
others.? Would you like me to draft some specific language.? (The language 
that you suggest in your e-mail is an excellent start, but it may need a 
little refinement in order to get White & Case to drop their objection.)

Have you heard from W&C-Bangkok or W&C-US?? We have not.? I am available for 
a conference call almost anytime. 

I do not think it is practical for U.S. lawyers to get to Thailand for a 
conference on Friday in Thailand.? Thursday, Nov. 23, is a major family 
holiday in the United States (probably the second biggest holiday in the 
entire year here.)? I am extremely reluctant to ask any U.S. lawyer to 
disrupt major family plans to attend this conference.? Is there any way to 
postpone it?

Has White & Case seen our memorandum about enforceability of indemnity 
claims.? That memo should go a long way toward showing W&C that we can 
probably reach agreement on this matter without lawyers having to travel to 
Thailand this week.

Subject:??????? RE: ECT Securities : Indemnity claim 

??????? ??????? Dear Khun Peangpanor / Khun Kasemsi 

??????? ??????? We refer to our telephone discussion last Friday regarding 
the enforcement of the Indemnity Clause in the Purchase Agreement. 

??????? ??????? As discussed, we would like to have a telephone conference 
call among W&C Bangkok and U.S., Milbank and us.? With respect to the 
objective of the conference call, we would like to propose that we discuss 
and agree on the circumstances that the Indemnity Clause can be enforceable. 
Then we will put such circumstances as a condition in the application of 
E.C.T. Securities. 

??????? ??????? For example, our statement to the Official Receiver may say 
that "The applicant has accepted that the claim under this application can 
be enforceable to the debtor (NSM) only in case 
[..........................]". 

??????? ??????? We need only the exact wording to be agreed on between W&C 
U.S. and Milbank.? We are not sure that it is possible that we say that "... 
only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for 
reasons of fraud or willful misconduct."?? (We just put the condition in the 
application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has 
occurred or not.? This fact will be proved in the future.? In case where 
E.C.T. Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future, 
it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred.) 

??????? ??????? We note from W&C Bangkok that W&C U.S. may call Milbank for 
a discussion on this matter today.? However, if you please forward this 
email to W&C U.S. so that the US lawyers of W&C can discuss with Milbank via 
email also. 

??????? ??????? If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this Wednesday 
evening, Bangkok time, it seems that all of us may have to ask W&C U.S. and 
Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this 
Friday.? It is very possible that, should the Official Receiver give an 
order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by 
the loser.? Such will incur lots of cost for both E.C.T. Securities and NSM. 
Therefore, an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all 
parties.

Lisa,

This is the info from Laynie in accounting. She confirmed the number of 
equity shares (40,992,500) with Richard Lauer. Did you by chance add the 
number of C note units to the equity? That would add to around 51mm shares. 

The aschedule that Laynie has also calculates the principal and interest due 
to date. Call me if you have questions.

Brian,

I left you a voicemail about meeting to discuss the NSM information but in 
case we miss each other today, here is what we have.

-  Per Tab 25, page 2 and Schedule A of the contract, Enron owns 40,992,500 
shares.

-  The attached schedule shows interest calculated through July 31, 2000 for 
the Series C Notes.  On March 13, 1999, the interest rate was increased by 
1.5% per Tab 20, page 5 of the contract.

 

Please call if you would like to discuss further.

Thanks,
Laynie

We write further to our telephone discussion with Deb Korkmas this evening
(our time) in relation to the above matter.

As discussed during the course of our telephone discussion, there are a
number of outstanding issues that, bearing in mind the 12 hour time
difference between Bangkok and you and the deadline of the claim submission
which is on Monday 7 August, we would require them to be settled by Friday.

1. Claim amounts
We note from the documentation so far received by us and your e-mail
yesterday that the following entities will claim under the following
agreements:

1.1 Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the principal amount
outstanding and the interest outstanding for the Notes under the Security
Purchase Agreement, Indenture and Guarantee.  We would appreciate it if this
could be confirmed and also the definite amount of principal and interest
that is to be claimed.

1.2 Enron North America Corp. wishes to claim for the shares (equity),
as listed in the Shareholders Agreement, held by it in NSM.  However, having
reviewed the documentation so far received by us we are unsure as to the
legal grounds under which Enron North America Corp is entitled to claim this
sum.  Could you please clarify the nature of this claim.

1.3 ECT Thailand Investment Inc. wishes to claim for the shares
(equity), as listed in the Securities Purchase Agreement, held by it in NSM.
However, as in 1.2 above, having reviewed the documentation received by us
we are unsure as to the legal grounds under which ECT Thailand Investment
Inc is entitled to claim this sum.  Could you please clarify the nature of
this claim.

1.4 ECT Securities Limited Partnership wishes to claim for any
contingent liability that they may be subject to as a result of the
litigation undertaken by Farallon Capital, et al. and Legg Mason Income
Trust, Inc., et al.  As discussed, the sums which are allowed to be claimed
have to be fixed sums as of the date on which the court granted an order to
reorganise NSM's business, i.e. 8 May 2000.  It would appear to us that,
asides from the legal fee sums, an exact sum for the contingent liabilities
cannot be ascertained at this time. I would, therefore, appreciate
clarification of how this is to be determined, otherwise the claim amount
may have to be the full potential liabilities as claimed in the two
litigation cases.

2. Documentation
As discussed, we also require the following documentation which we
understand will be faxed to us during the course of today.

2.1 Corporate documents of the 3 entities making claims
2.2 Evidence of the change in the entities name if different from the
name in the relevant agreements
2.2 Debenture Certificate (either global or definitive)
2.3 Evidence of the payment purchase price
2.4 A copy of the Notice of the Event of Default or demand letters as
sent by the Trustee (if any)
2.5 The "Definition and Rules of Usage" as defined in the Shareholders
Agreement (in addition, we do not know whether your claims in relation to
the Shareholders Agreement are related to certain documents as described
therein, e.g. Management Agreement, Enron Purchase Agreement, if they are
related, we would require copies of such agreements as well)
2.6 Tables setting out all amounts (i.e. principal, interest, expenses,
etc.) being claimed by the 3 claiming entities

As mentioned in our discussion, in order to complete the application on time
we would really need to have everything in place by Friday, given the
deadline of the claim submission is on Monday, 7 August.  We would,
therefore, appreciate it if you could reply to all of the above outstanding
issues by today (your time) so that if there are any further outstanding
issues we can try and clarify these during the course of tomorrow (our time)
and perhaps during the weekend.  You may either respond to this email or
alternatively call my mobile phone (661) 619 1262 or Richard Smith's mobile
phone (661) 611 1184.

Best regards

Pichitphon Eammongkolchai / Richard Smith

Farallon/Oaktree's counsel, Bruce MacLeod, began his questioning of Izower on 
Friday 9/1.? MacLeod began by establishing that (1) in drafting the offering 
White & Case attorneys relied upon information given to them by the 
underwriters and (2) if the underwriters would have indicated to White & Case 
that information in the offering memo was incorrect, White & Case would have 
changed the offering memorandum.? MacLeod also established that Izower had 
discussed the related party transactions with all of the initial purchasers 
at one point or another.? MacLeod then attempted to revist the issue 
concerning Chanmi's integrity and whether Chanmi's acceptance of kickbacks 
was discussed with the underwriter group.? Izower's counsel refused to allow 
MacLeod to revisit this testimony and McLeod ended his inquiry.

SDI's counsel, Mike Strub, was the only defense counsel to ask questions. (I 
determined that the it made no sense to draw any attention to Enron/ECT given 
that the testimony concerning Enron/ECT had been limited to general 
statements concerning the "underwriters').? Strub attempted to establish that 
SDI was not listed on White & Case's responsibility outline as one of the 
drafters of the offering memo.? Izower agreed that SDI did not initially 
draft the offering documents, but indicated that SDI commented on drafts.? 
Izower also testified that he asked SDI's counsel Bob Walters to review the 
related party transactions section of the memo and to comment on its 
accuracy.? On rebuttal, MacLeod focused on SDI and established that SDI 
reviewed and revised portions of the offering memo. and that Busse attended 
the road shows and never advised Izower that the information contained in the 
memo. concerning SDI's role was inaccurate.

We have recently engaged an investment banker to testify as an expert for ECT
about the quality of our due diligence in the NSM transaction.  (This is
standard procedure in a litigation matter of this type.)  Our "expert" has now
read all four volumes of your deposition, and I have sent him a slightly
edited version of your due diligence notes.  However, our expert still needs
to conduct more "due diligence" of his own, including talking or meeting
(probably separately) with you and Kevin and possibly Tom Glanville.  I will
call you shortly to schedule a conference call or a meeting.  You and I will
talk separately before any such call or meeting takes place.

In the meantime, I would appreciate it if you could provide me with answers to
the following questions: 1.  Please send me your personal resume, with an eye 
toward showing your
experience and qualifications to conduct due diligence.

2.  Are you aware of any internal check-lists, document review requests or
lists, agendas (overall, meeting- or conference call-related, or otherwise)
and any other documents which would show matters reviewed or to-be reviewed in
connection with the NSM transaction?  (We will separately review the Enron
documents that have been produced in the litigation to see if we can identify
any such materials ourselves.)

3.  Was any due diligence done on NTS?

Thanks, Brian.  I will work hard to minimize the time you have to spend in
this phase of our endeavor.  It will be nothing close to the time that you
spent on your deposition and preparation

The dissolution document for the management Company looks fine to Paul and 
me. 

"Skadden International" in Singapore (possibly a different entity from the 
one subpoenaed) represented Enron International with respect to the proposed 
co-gen facility.? As far as we can tell, Skadden had no role in the offering 
itself.

Skadden International's services to EI were in fact substantial.

Kathy continued with Nolan and did not finish.? Nolan is likely to continue 
until Friday.? As a result, Izower's deposition has been taken off calendar 
for this Friday.

Highlights: 

--Kathy spent the bulk of the morning walking Nolan through videos that SDI 
personnel took of the poor quality steel being produced at the plant.

--Kathy continued to elicit testimony regarding the problems with the quality 
of the steel and the operations of the plant, e.g. Nolan testified that NSM 
had $25 million in scrap sitting on the ground and no money to buy pig iron 
or spare parts.? (Kathy's point was that NSM spent far to much on scrap 
leaving no funds for other necessary items).

--Kathy spent alot of time with Nolan on a meeting that took place in SDI's 
offices on Aug. 21 between Busse, Nolan, Bob Walters, Brian Barth, Kevin 
McConville and Stickler.? Nolan's handwritten notes of the meeting suggested 
that the group decided to abandon the filing of the F-1 and F-4 Registration 
Statements with the SEC in order to avoid having to disclose NSM's current 
state of affairs.? Nolan did not have a good recollection of the meeting.? 
Shortly after this meeting, Busse's lawyer sent a letter to White & Case 
indicating that Busse would not sign the Registration Statement.? Nolan's 
notes also indicated that Bob Walters reviewed a letter to him from Busse 
that has appeared on SDI's privilege log.? Kathy made a formal request for 
the document on grounds that the presence of Barth, McConville and Stickler 
at the meeting destroyed any attorney client privilege between Busse and his 
lawyer.? Gindler refused to produce it on grounds of privilege. (we haven't 
heard the end of this issue).

Richard, 

Today I attended the deposition of Bruce Karsh, President and Principal of 
Oaktree Capital Management.? Dan Lefler, representing SDI, took the lead and 
asked questions regarding why Karsh chooses to invest in certain companies,? 
and why he chose to invest in NSM.? Karsh did not mention Enron or ECT, and 
he stated that the reason he invested in NSM was two fold -- first, he knew 
SDI was involved and second, he knew Busse was involved and both would bring 
great experience to the project.? 

Karsh was asked about the terms of the settlement agreement with Enron.? I 
objected.? Karsh did not answer the question.? It was left open as to whether 
we would produce the settlement agreement.? We will not produce the 
settlement agreement and will oppose any attempt by Oaktree to voluntarily 
produce the agreement.? 

Please call me at (213) 892-4556if you have any questions.?

NSM Bankruptcy Claim

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of the indemnification 
portion of a claim by Enron entities in the NSM bankruptcy.? I have tried to 
make the claim as big as possible, which makes it rather vague and 
wishy-washy.? Maybe you can suggest changes.

At the risk of differing with Lisa and Paul, I really do not understand why 
this is a good idea.? It seems to me that any claim by Enron is an unsecured 
claim, way down in priority, clearly behind all of the bondholders, at least 
to the extent of their security.? I don't understand how this claim creates 
any threat to the plaintiffs or settlement pressure on anyone.

In addition, I hate saying the things we have to say to state a claim.? In 
the litigation, we consistently say that we did nothing wrong, we were 
victims too, the few people who did sue us should see their mistake and 
dismiss us.? Now we propose to file a public document saying the opposite:? 
that we fear the suits that have been filed and we expect more, producing 
tens--maybe hundreds--of millions of dollars of exposure.

While we should continue to move this aspect of Enron's claim along, so we 
are ready to file if we want to, I think we should consider a conference call 
among Lisa, Paul, Richard, and me to talk through the wisdom of the 
indemnification claim.? (I don't worry nearly so much about a fraud claim on 
Enron's securities purchases, because that does not go against our litigation 
position, although I still don't see what good such a claim would do.)

Richard and Bill:

Damage figures with prejudgment interest thru 3/31/01 are:

          Farallon            $21.8 million
          Oaktree            $13.2 million
          Legg Mason       $4.9 million

Farallon's damages are 62% of the total damages in Hennigan's case.

If the case were to settle for the total that Hennigan seeks, $29.3 million=
,
Farallon would get $18.2 million, and Oaktree would get $11.1 million.

If Enron were to contribute $1.25 million to an overall settlement as
suggested, we would be paying about 7% of Farallon's damages.

If everyone but us were to settle for the suggested retail price (assuming
that Hennigan would do such a deal), Farallon's remaining damages would be
$4.4 million.

The ratio of Farallon's damages to Legg Mason's is 4.4:1.

     *********

I think our goal should be to settle Farallon for $1,000,000 and Legg Mason
for $200,000, and I think that should be achievable.

I would offer the other defendants a contribution from Enron of $750,00
(pointing out to the defendants that this is a substantial increase over ou=
r
opening offer to Hennigan of $450,000.)  I would stick on $750,00 quite a
while, saying that we are very reluctant to pay any seven figure number, tr=
y
to get defendants to think that their biggest challenge is to get us to $1
million, then finally give in to that figure.

We have bargaining power.  Any defendant who wants to settle has to have us=
 in
it's group; therefore we can hold out for a smaller share.

If we so settle, we need mutual releases of all NSM-related claims among al=
l
settling defendants.

If the settling group is less than all defendants, the settlement must be
conditioned on obtaining a good faith settlement order.

Good luck.

Steve

Richard, I have obtained a copy of the complaints in all of the NSM 
litigation around the country.? Attached is an updated chart identifying all 
of the plaintiffs.? I will review the complaints and the applicable statutes 
of limitation.

On a related matter, this morning Judge Berle granted defendants leave to 
file cross complaints against Schultes and the individual fund managers for 
Oaktree and Farallon.? Plaintiffs' counsel argued that the complaints did not 
state a cause of action against the fund managers and were duplicative of the 
affirmative defenses already stated.? Judge Berle invited Plaintiffs to 
pursue any such challenge by demurrer (motion to dismiss).

Dave,

Kevin McConville was deposed yesterday in Houston.  His rough transcript is
attached.

The deposition questioner jumped around and never went through the whole story
front to back, so you may not find this that helpful.  However, there is a
passage near the end where Kevin talks directly about Schultes' getting fired.
 You should be able to find this quickly by doing a word search on Schultes.

 Richard,

My wife Marilyn does research for our law firm on a part time basis, and I
have had her do a couple of projects on the NSM cases:  she worked a lot on
the contribution/indemnity memo that I sent you a few weeks ago, and more
recently she prepared a memorandum on the law concerning whether a non-lead
underwriter can make a separate "reasonable care" showing under our state
securities law even where the lead underwriter may not be able successfully=
 to
carry its own burden of reasonable care.  Marilyn's memorandum on this subj=
ect
is attached.  This memorandum also surveys the cases on who is a "seller"
under the state law.

These issues, ECT Securities' own reasonable care and ECT's not having sold
NSM securities to plaintiffs, will all be key points in our Memorandum of
Contentions of Fact and Law now under preparation and, if we get a motion f=
or
summary judgment, will form the principal elements of our opposition to the
motion.

Steve

Richard,

     The only significant deposition this week is taking place in Minneapolis.
 The deponent is Arthur Cobb, a disclosure/due diligence expert retained by
Robins, Kaplan in several cases in which Enron is not named.  Mr. Cobb's
report did not mention ECT Securities, and the California plaintiffs did not
designate him to testify in the CA cases, so we decided not to attend his
deposition.  We are getting daily transcripts by e-mail.

     Next week an expert designated by the CA plaintiffs on causation and
damage issues is being deposed in San Francisco.  Roland has a scheduling
conflict, so I am sending Jonathan Goldblatt.  The subject on which we want to
ask questions is damages relating to certain purchases by Farallon after the
initial offering.  This is a very discrete area, easy to understand, and
Jonathan is on top of it.

     I believe that you recently received a bill from Gerry McGrath.  Gerry
worked very hard on his report, putting in about 50% more hours than he
thought he would when he agreed to cap the total fee for his report.  He is
very focused on the requirement in his engagement letter that he be paid in 30
days.  I think Gerry did quite a good job, and we definitely need his best
effort going forward.  I would urge Enron to pay Gerry's bill very promptly.

     Farallon is currently threatening to move to compel further answers to
interrogatories from us.  It is much ado about nothing.  We just want to deal
with it in the least expensive way.

     Many of the plaintiffs have filed motions around the country, including
in CA, seeking to compel Natwest to produce more audio tapes of employee
conversations.  My guess is that the plaintiffs have found more good stuff,
and Natwest is trying to limit their losses.

     We are hard at work on the research that you and I have been discussing. 
It is frankly quite complex and involves several unanswered questions of law. 
The problem is that CA has a special statutory contribution provision (pro
rata, not relative fault) in the state securities statutes and a common law
doctrine of partial indemnity in tort actions that is based on relative fault.
 The later doctrine may not apply to the securities causes of action against
ECT Securities, but definitely applies to the common law fraud and negligent
misrepresentation causes of action.  How all of this works together is
virtually uncharted.

     With reference to your question about procedures at trial, none of the
defendants has cross-complained against the other defendants for a
determination of relative fault in the pending case; and, on the basis of the
current pleadings, no such determination will be made at trial.  If Enron goes
to trial and loses, along with others, theoretically the plaintiffs could
collect their entire judgment from Enron and leave Enron to pursue the other
defendants, post-trial, for their respective shares of the liability, whether
such shares are determined pro rata or by relative fault.  We are working on a
memorandum or outline that will lay all of this out for you.  I think you will
find that Enron has some powerful incentives to settle (assuming that we can
get the price low enough.)

Richard: 

The deposition of David Wheeler resumed today in New York.? Corey Gordon of 
Robins, Kaplan asked all of the questions.? I "attended" by internet; I was 
able to receive live audio, video, and transcript concurrently in real time.? 
Only minor problem was that I could not assert objections; the lawyers and 
the technical people are now looking for a fix for this.? This technology is 
definitely the waive of the future.

Most of the deposition was quite uninteresting from Enron's point of view.? 
Gordon mostly went over old areas that have little relevance to us.

There was one exception.? Gordon marked an exhibit (1198) about the 
underwriting fee, which shows an early allocation of the fee and suggests:

??????? (1)? Enron's fee was supposed to be $1 million, as Brian has been 
saying (Later documents that state that Enron was to get 6% of $16,653,900 
look like after the fact rationales for paying Enron $1 million); 

??????? (2)? McDonald and NatWest were fighting over whose share of the 
underwriting fee would be the source of the $1 million to be paid to Enron; 
and

??????? (3)? The approximately $1.6 million fee to PaineWebber was to give 
"all of the underwriters . . . access to Marcus' research report."

In addition, this exhibit prompted Wheeler to testify that Enron "was 
insisting on being named to the underwriting syndicate."

??????? ??????? An excerpt of Wheeler's testimony and a copy of exhibit 1198 
are attached.

Richard: 

I got your Saturday voicemails. 

We will produce the documents. 

We are mindful of the need to making discriminating decisions about which 
depositions to attend.? To date we have not attended, and/or do not plan to 
attend, depositions not noticed in the Farallon or Legg mason cases, 
depositions of other defendants concerning their production of documents to 
plaintiffs, and depositions of various NatWest witnesses relating to the 
contention of several NatWest entities that they are not subject to personal 
jurisdiction in California.? To date we have attended, or plan to attend, the 
depos of Busse, Nolan, and Schultes.? We have also attended the depo of Rich 
Goldstein of Oaktree and have been planning to attend depositions this week 
of Bruce Karsh and Michael Wachthorn, also Oaktree people.? Our decision to 
attend these depositions is a close call ( and we can reverse, if you 
disagree.)? Our thought is that, even though Oaktree is not suing Enron, the 
Oaktree depos give us insight into the process by which investors decided to 
invest in NSM and what facts they believed about NSM, and, since these depos 
are in LA, the cost of attending them is not nearly so high as some of the 
other depositions.

Concerning an indemnification of ECT by NSM, remember that there was no 
"underwriting agreement" between ECT and the other underwriters and/or NSM, 
so I question whether there is an express contractual indemnity.? I have 
never seen it.? There may well be an agreement between NSM and McDonald (and 
perhaps NatWest) that indemnifies those entities and such an agreement may 
provide a basis for an indemnity claim by ECT as well.? Should we try to find 
such a document?? Query, what difference does it make if NSM has an indemnity 
obligation to ECT--does NSM have any assets to pay unsecured creditors???

Tom Hatch concluded his examination of Aron Izower today.? Lawyers for the 
other plaintiffs will begin tomorrow.? Izower was a first-year lawyer at 
White & Case when he began working on the NSM offering in Oct. 1997.? The 
senior White & Case lawyers who worked on the deal have either changed firms 
or retired.

Highlights: 

--Hatch spent much of the morning on the off-take agreements and their 
description in the offering memo.? Izower strongly defended offering memo's 
description of the off-take agreements as accurate but would not cooperate 
with Hatch when asked to point out where in the off-take agreements Preussag 
or Klockner were "obligated" to purchase NSM's steel.? Izower's counsel 
objected to the questions as calling for a legal conclusion.? 

--Hatch walked Izower through the various drafts of the off-take agreements 
and asked if Izower had discussed the changes with the "underwriting group."? 
Izower testified that most of the comments were received from Gleacher 
Natwest, McDonald, Cravath and SDI.? Izower produced a responsibility 
schedule concerning certain documents related to the offering with completion 
dates.? Enron/ECT is not mentioned in the document as having had any role in 
the drafting although Izower did mention, as an afterthought, that Enron and 
Paine Webber may also have provided comments on the off-take agreements.

--Hatch established that the offering memo failed to disclose the existence 
of certain material agreements such as: 
a)????? Employment agreements between NSM and Swasdi Horrungruang and NSM and 
Chamni Janchai (who was thought of as being a crook) pursuant to which they 
received an annual salary of $350,000 for ten years;

b)????? A Throughput Agreement between Sriracha Harbor and NSM pursuant to 
which NSM offering proceeds would be diverted to the Harbor (which Swasdi had 
an ownership interest in) and to certain Thai banks who were owed sums from 
the Harbor.? Apparently, the Thai banks were threatening a foreclosure and 
take over of the Harbor jeopardizing NSM's ability to import and export 
materials.? The payment sums are not disclosed.? In less than convincing 
fashion, Izower indicated that the agreement was probably not mentioned in 
the offering memo as it may not have qualified as "related party transaction."

--Izower had no idea why the legal, financial and advisory fees on the NSM 
deal had increased from $29 million to $35 million.

Dear Steve 

Thank you very much for your quick response. 

1.??? My suggested wording is just to make it quickly for the discussion. 
It will be appreciate if you could draft the specific wording for us then we 
will email it to White & Case. That will make the discussion between you and 
White & Case be easy and quick.? 

2.?? White&Case have not contacted us yet for today.? This afternoon, I will 
try to chase them to contact you quickly and try to get the name of the 
contact person at White&Case, U.S. for you. 

3.??? I understand your reason.? It is possible to postpone the meeting. 
After it seems that we cannot reach the agreed wording within this 
Wednesday, I will contact the official receiver and other parties to 
postpone the meeting for our witness.? 

4.??? I think they already received your memorandum because White&Case, 
Bangkok received it last Thursday.? 

By the way, I have a suggestion that you may not have to discuss with 
White&Case to much on the academic legal issues but we just need them to 
agree with our proposal of adding the condition in the application and let 
them agreed with your wording.

Subject: RE: ECT Securities : Indemnity claim 


Dear Mr. Ngodngam: 

I very much like your idea of ECT's amending its claim to add a "condition" 
to the claim to accommodate W&C's position about the unenforceability of 
indemnity agreements vis-a-vis certain types of securities claims and not 
others.? Would you like me to draft some specific language.? (The language 
that you suggest in your e-mail is an excellent start, but it may need a 
little refinement in order to get White & Case to drop their objection.) 

Have you heard from W&C-Bangkok or W&C-US?? We have not.? I am available for 
a conference call almost anytime. 

I do not think it is practical for U.S. lawyers to get to Thailand for a 
conference on Friday in Thailand.? Thursday, Nov. 23, is a major family 
holiday in the United States (probably the second biggest holiday in the 
entire year here.)? I am extremely reluctant to ask any U.S. lawyer to 
disrupt major family plans to attend this conference.? Is there any way to 
postpone it? 

Has White & Case seen our memorandum about enforceability of indemnity 
claims.? That memo should go a long way toward showing W&C that we can 
probably reach agreement on this matter without lawyers having to travel to 
Thailand this week. 

Steve Howard

??????? Subject:??????? RE: ECT Securities : Indemnity claim 

??????? ??????????????? Dear Khun Peangpanor / Khun Kasemsi 

??????? ??????????????? We refer to our telephone discussion last Friday 
regarding 
the enforcement of the Indemnity Clause in the Purchase Agreement. 

??????? ??????????????? As discussed, we would like to have a telephone 
conference 
call among W&C Bangkok and U.S., Milbank and us.? With respect to the 
objective of the conference call, we would like to propose that we discuss 
and agree on the circumstances that the Indemnity Clause can be enforceable. 

Then we will put such circumstances as a condition in the application of 
E.C.T. Securities. 

??????? ??????????????? For example, our statement to the Official Receiver 
may say 
that "The applicant has accepted that the claim under this application can 
be enforceable to the debtor (NSM) only in case 
[..........................]". 

??????? ??????????????? We need only the exact wording to be agreed on 
between W&C 
U.S. and Milbank.? We are not sure that it is possible that we say that "... 

only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for 
reasons of fraud or willful misconduct."?? (We just put the condition in the 

application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has 
occurred or not.? This fact will be proved in the future.? In case where 
E.C.T. Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future, 

it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred.) 

??????? ??????????????? We note from W&C Bangkok that W&C U.S. may call 
Milbank for 
a discussion on this matter today.? However, if you please forward this 
email to W&C U.S. so that the US lawyers of W&C can discuss with Milbank via 

email also. 

??????? ??????????????? If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this 
Wednesday 
evening, Bangkok time, it seems that all of us may have to ask W&C U.S. and 
Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this 
Friday.? It is very possible that, should the Official Receiver give an 
order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by 
the loser.? Such will incur lots of cost for both E.C.T. Securities and NSM. 

Therefore, an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all 
parties. 

??????? ??????????????? If you have any question, please feel free to call 
us.

Here is a report on the final session of the deposition of Gib Cooper.  The
report also discusses a problem that we appear to have in distancing ourselves
from the secondary market sale of NSM bonds to Legg Mason by Natwest three and
a half weeks after the initial offering.

Richard: 

It was another great deposition day for the plaintiffs.? The high point was 
an audio taped phone conversation of Max Holmes' calling Stickler a liar.? A 
more detailed report is attached.

Frankly, I don't think McDonald and NatWest can let this case go to trial.? 
They will almost surely lose, and lose big, and PaineWebber could be drawn in 
too.? I think I will make a renewed pitch to Bruce MacLeod (Farallon's lawyer 
here this week) to let ECT out.? I will keep you posted.

Lisa:? re your point no. 2, shouldn't we also make a fraud claim on the B 
bonds?? Even though we no longer own these bonds, we took a big loss on them 
because of NSM's fraud and we continue to hold that fraud claim unless we 
expressly transferred it to our buyer, which is unlikely.

Richard, 

I attended the deposition of Michael Watchorn, a bond fund manager at Oaktree 
Capital, on August 1, 2000.? Dan Lefler representing SDI? took the lead, and 
was primarily interested in how Watchorn's group and Oaktree determine 
whether to invest in a company or not.? Lefler focused on Watchorn's 
experience in valuing steel mills, and what Watchorn looked at to determine 
whether it was a good investment.? Specifically, Lefler brought up what 
Watchorn analyzed and for what purpose, i.e. EBITDA determine the gross 
cashflow in the company and lays out the over all costs of the company.

Watchorn only attended the road show because K. Murphy at Natwest invited him 
and told him that Busse would be there.? Busse ultimately did not come.? 
Watchorn is in the bond group and only invests in N. America, so he was not 
interested in investing in the steel mill.? He remembers attending the road 
show, but he did not know who the presenters were, he didn't read the 
preliminary offering memo, the supp. offering memo or the final, and he never 
received them.? He didn't discuss the road show with anyone.? 

Watchorn seemed like a very bright guy.? The only interesting part of the 
depo. was when Natwest was clearly trying to get Watchorn to say that Natwest 
did not call up to solicit Watchorn to attend the road show.? 

Please call me if you have any questions.?

Richard: 

Thanks so much for your fax. 

We will prepare a memorandum on Issue 1.1.? We hope to e-mail you a draft 
Monday evening Los Angeles time, Tuesday your time.? (There is an easy answer 
to the question that has been posed.? Our challenge is to write our 
memorandum clearly, so that it can be understood by someone not familiar with 
the legal system and terminology in the U.S.? Please let us know if there is 
anything in our draft that is not clear.)

I understand that you are not seeking our input on Issues 1.2 and 1.3 

My direct fax, which gets to me sooner, is 213-892-4748. 

Thanks 

Steve Howard

Here is the passage from the first day of Brian's deposition in which Shawna
Ballard, of Hennegan's firm, asked Brian substantive questions about his
meeting with her partner, Mike Swartz.

As a result of Ms. Ballard's asking these questions, the other defendants
asked Brian many questions about his meeting with Swartz and about any
meetings with other plaintiffs' counsel, which brought out the meeting with
Kathy.  The defendants established that Mike and Kathy both took notes during
their meetings; and defendants have now demanded those notes.

Richard: 

Kathy finished her questions at the end of the day yesterday.? Her approach 
was very helpful to Enron, and also PaineWebber, even to the point of 
skipping pages in documents that referred to either of them.? Enron's name 
was mentioned probably three or four times in three days (and then only in 
questions, not in answers).

Kathy's themes were: 

??????? 1.? At the time of the offering, portions of the hot mill were 
incomplete, and the hot mill was not really operating.

??????? 2.? The design of the cold mill was flawed. 

??????? 3.? The role of SDI in the managment of NSM was greatly exaggerated 
in the offering presentations.? [Kathy did not seem to be be saying (as other 
have) that the role of the Management Co. was exaggerated.]

??????? 4.? Nucor was really Stickler's first choice for SDI's role, but 
Nucor pulled out becasue of substantive concerns, e.g., flawed design of cold 
mill.? Stickler lied when he told others that Nucor just wanted too much 
money.? (Based on what I have seen so far, I don't think we know yet why 
Stickler and Nucor did not make a deal.)

??????? 5.? By late April 1998, if not before, NSM managment and directors 
knew that the projections in the offering materials were way off, as NSM's 
own internal budget was much different.? (Roland and I showed you these 
documents when we were last in Houston.)? A substantial portion of the 
offering funds were still in trust at this time (how much???), and the 
bondholders should have been told (when they could still pull back some of 
their money if they wanted to) that the projections on which they had 
invesfted were not correct.? [If this argument were developed and had legal 
merit, it could hurt Enron, as its affiliates or employees were (a) "initial 
purchasers" in the offering, (b) a member of the management co., and (c) a 
member of the NSM board.]

??????? Kathy was never clear in her questioning whether she regarded SDI as 
a defrauder or a defraudee.? At times she seemed to be saying that SDI knew 
bad things about NSM and the mill and concealed them or permitted others to 
lie about them.? At other times she seemed to be inviting Busse to say that 
he was lied to.

??????? There is no question that Kathy regards David Stickler as the number 
one bad guy and David Wheeler (NatWest) as number two.

??????? Busse's principal themes were:? (1) SDI agreed only to a very limited 
role; (2) all of the problems were soluble IF NSM had good management.? NSM 
turned out to have terrible managment.? Busse and everyone else were lied to 
about that, and that is why NSM failed.

??????? I had not realized before this week that, by the time of the closing, 
the Management Co. had only 3 members (SDI and affiliates of McDonald and 
Enron.)? [Stickler was appointed manager of the Management Co.]? If Enron has 
a problem in this case, it will likely arise out of the combination of 
enron's two roles--i.e., involved in the offering itself and then in the 
follow on management of NSM.

??????? I suggest that, if I can't make progress with Hirschmann next week,? 
we (Milbank) notice and take Legg-Mason's deposition (assuming that the other 
defendants agree--and maybe even if they don't.)? It's time to stop letting 
Legg Mason have a free ride.

I wanted to give you an update as to the status of the NSM Cases:

1)  Farallon:  There is a signed settlement agreement in place.  (I have th=
e
plaintiffs' signature pages and am gathering the other defendants' and will
forward you a fully-executed copy when I've got it.)  However, the case has
not been dismissed yet because of two small issues, neither of which involv=
es
Enron/ECT Securities directly.  First, plaintiffs had wanted two signatures=
 from each defendant on the
Settlement Agreement.  (The California corporations code provides that a
corporation cannot claim lack of authority by signers of a document if both
the president or a vice president and the secretary, CFO or treasurer sign.=
) I've convinced them to accept one signature from ECT Securities because i=
t is
a limited partnership, so the code provision does not apply.  However, the
plaintiffs are insisting that Natwest, several of whose entities are
corporations, provide two signatures instead of only one.  I suspect the is=
sue
will be worked out this week - there is a hearing scheduled for Friday (7/2=
0)
at which the case is expected to be dismissed.

Second, several of the defendants (but not ECT Securities) have cross-claim=
s
against John Schultes that were not released in the settlement with
plaintiffs.  In negotiating to settle those claims, Schultes indicated that=
 he
wanted to be released from liability by all defendants, including ECT
Securities.  However, we have made clear to the other parties that ECT
Securities (and its affiliates) will not release any claims it may have
against Schultes (e.g., for indemnification and/or contribution with respec=
t
to our settlement amount and attorneys fees) without being released from al=
l
liability to Schultes relating to NSM - including the action he filed in Oh=
io
state court, in which he sued Enron.  The other defendants may settle with
Schultes and simply leave ECT out of it, in which case the entire Farallon
case could be dismissed, leaving Enron/ECT to deal with Schultes on our own=
. (ECT has the right to bring any indemnification or contribution claims in=
 a
separate action, so dismissal of the case would not affect its rights.)  I'=
ll
keep you updated on this - we should know more by the hearing on Friday
morning.

2)  Legg Mason.  We have a fully-executed settlement agreement.  (I'll send
you a copy later today.)  Plaintiffs expect to dismiss the case later this
week - perhaps at the hearing on Friday in Farallon.  I'll keep you updated=
.

3)  Agreement among defendants.  All defendants have signed the agreement a=
nd
releases.  I will have all signature pages today and send you a copy.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (310) 551-9180 or
return this e-mail.

Thanks.

Rittichai: 

I suggest adding the following language to ECT's claim: 

"The foregoing claim does not seek indemnification from NSM against any 
claims arising under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 of the United States or against any claims that require proof of 
fraud or willful misconduct on the part of the Applicant."

This language has not yet been reviewed by Enron counsel or other lawyers at 
Milbank.? By copy of this e-mail to them, I am asking each to let you and me 
know of any changes that they suggest.

Dear Steve 

Thank you very much for your quick response. 

1.??? My suggested wording is just to make it quickly for the discussion. 
It will be appreciate if you could draft the specific wording for us then we 
will email it to White & Case. That will make the discussion between you and 
White & Case be easy and quick.? 

2.?? White&Case have not contacted us yet for today.? This afternoon, I will 
try to chase them to contact you quickly and try to get the name of the 
contact person at White&Case, U.S. for you. 

3.??? I understand your reason.? It is possible to postpone the meeting. 
After it seems that we cannot reach the agreed wording within this 
Wednesday, I will contact the official receiver and other parties to 
postpone the meeting for our witness.? 

4.??? I think they already received your memorandum because White&Case, 
Bangkok received it last Thursday.? 

By the way, I have a suggestion that you may not have to discuss with 
White&Case to much on the academic legal issues but we just need them to 
agree with our proposal of adding the condition in the application and let 
them agreed with your wording.

Dear Mr. Ngodngam: 

I very much like your idea of ECT's amending its claim to add a "condition" 
to the claim to accommodate W&C's position about the unenforceability of 
indemnity agreements vis-a-vis certain types of securities claims and not 
others.? Would you like me to draft some specific language.? (The language 
that you suggest in your e-mail is an excellent start, but it may need a 
little refinement in order to get White & Case to drop their objection.) 

Have you heard from W&C-Bangkok or W&C-US?? We have not.? I am available for 
a conference call almost anytime. 

I do not think it is practical for U.S. lawyers to get to Thailand for a 
conference on Friday in Thailand.? Thursday, Nov. 23, is a major family 
holiday in the United States (probably the second biggest holiday in the 
entire year here.)? I am extremely reluctant to ask any U.S. lawyer to 
disrupt major family plans to attend this conference.? Is there any way to 
postpone it? 

Has White & Case seen our memorandum about enforceability of indemnity 
claims.? That memo should go a long way toward showing W&C that we can 
probably reach agreement on this matter without lawyers having to travel to 
Thailand this week.

only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for 
reasons of fraud or willful misconduct."?? (We just put the condition in the 

application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has 
occurred or not.? This fact will be proved in the future.? In case where 
E.C.T. Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future, 

it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred.) 

??????? ??????????????? We note from W&C Bangkok that W&C U.S. may call 
Milbank for 
a discussion on this matter today.? However, if you please forward this 
email to W&C U.S. so that the US lawyers of W&C can discuss with Milbank via 

email also. 

??????? ??????????????? If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this 
Wednesday 
evening, Bangkok time, it seems that all of us may have to ask W&C U.S. and 
Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this 
Friday.? It is very possible that, should the Official Receiver give an 
order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by 
the loser.? Such will incur lots of cost for both E.C.T. Securities and NSM. 

Therefore, an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all 
parties.

Why don't I start sending you a brief e-mail every Friday summarizing
activities in the case for that week and what is coming up soon.  Nothing
fancy or time consuming, just a brief update

For example:

Today:

          (1) The court in California (a) ruled that Natwest does not have to
disclose tapes of conversations with Cravath in October of 1998, even about
March 1998 disclosures, and even though Natwest is asserting an advice of
counsel defense with respect to the March disclosures and (b) deferred ruling
whether Natwest must disclose conversations with Cravath in March 1998
concerning disclosure issues relating to the C Tranche.  (I want to find out
what this is about; maybe Enron would be interested in such information.)

          (2)  Defendants had a conference call to discuss an effort by
Natwest to postpone the trial in California until September.  I don't think
Natwest has much chance to succeed, but they are going ahead.  I am not
planning for  ECT Securities to take a position.

          (3)  We served unsigned copies of Gerry McGrath's report, after
removing a big section discussing Hellmold's report in light of Tom Hatch's
statement to me that Hellmold would not be opining on anything specific to ECT
Securities.

Later this week:

        Hellmold's deposition is scheduled for this Thursday and Friday in NY.
 I plan to attend and will pin him down about whatever he has to say, or not
say, about ECT Securities.


Do you have time tomorrow for us to call Kathy about Ponti Singh's depo (and
also her remark on the street to Brian that McDonald is going to blame Enron
for something concerning related party transactions?

Here is the rough transcript from Schultes' sixth day of deposition.? The 
deposition should end tomorrow.? I have hung on here, because I want to be 
present when the lawyers for Farallon and Legg Mason ask their questions.? 
They are starting first thing in the morning.

I will call you about the deposition generally or write you a report or 
both.? It has been a very valuable experience.? I know a lot more about the 
plaintiff's case than I did before, and I have had a very good opportunity to 
get close to the plaintiffs' lawyers and convey the message that Enron really 
does not belong in the case.? For the last two nights I've had dinner with 
the plaintiffs' lawyers--both nights with the Piper, Marbury and Robins, 
Kaplan lawyers, one night with the Farallon and Legg Mason lawyers as well.? 
I think we are making good progress.

John Schultes is quite smart and very precise in his use of language.? Even 
though he speaks with an accent, he is easy to understand and he is very 
careful with his words.? I thought he acquitted himself reasonably well under 
difficult conditions.? However, Schultes' natural demeanor is somewhat formal 
and aloof; I don't think a jury is going to like him.? At best they'll be 
neutral; they won't warm up to him. 

Schultes has sued McDonald and SDI in Cleveland, Ohio--apparently some sort 
of defamation and wrongful termination.? I am getting the complaint, will 
have it sent to you.? Schultes was deposed for three days a few weeks ago in 
that case.? We will try to get the transcript.

Schultes is unemployed.? His defense is being paid for by AIG under a D&O 
policy. 

Kathy spent a lot of time on Schultes' response in 9/98 to Bob Walters 8/98 
memo.? In his response Schultes acknowledged a number of shortcomings at NSM 
but took the position that everyone knew all about them at the time of the 
offering.

KPMG wrote management letters in connection with NSM financial statements for 
the year ended 12/31/96 and the quarters ended 3/31/97 and 6/30/97--probably 
for later periods as well, like 12/31/97.? KPMG has produced documents.? We 
are getting them this week.? E&Y also did a special report for McDonald in 
the second half of 1997; McDonald has produced a copy.? E&Y is still fighting 
about producing its documents.? Schultes says he never saw the E&Y report.

Enron came up twice today, not with much emphasis--both times dealing with 
events after the closing.? A memo of Brian's dated 7/28/98 relating to a 
Management Company meeting was discussed briefly.? The report or review that 
the Enron team prepared in August 1998 was discussed at a little more 
length.? Nothing harmful.? To date there has been virtually no testimony 
about any role of Enron or ECT in the underwriting process--just about all 
testimony has been about post-closing events.

Kathy also pressed Schultes to admit that NSM's actual production of steel 
before the offering was quite limited.? Schultes quarreled with her a bit on 
this.

Richard: 

Here is a report on today's deposition. 

Roland will cover tomorrow. 

Next week we are going to try something different; we will attend by 
internet:? we get video, audio, and transcript, all real-time.? If this 
works, we should be able to cut down on live attendance (and save money) in 
the future.? I'll let you know.

Tom Hatch asked me today why Enron did not just settle cheap with Farallon 
and Legg Mason and walk away from all these cases.? I told him we were 
considering it, but Enron did not want to encourage anyone else to sue Enron 
by showing a willingness to pay money just to get out of a lawsuit.? Tom 
replied that he thought that there was virtually no chance that anyone else 
would sue Enron now.? Since Hatch's clients have appeared to be the most 
likely prospects for still suing Enron, this was a very encouraging 
conversation.

Richard: 

Here is a report on the fifth day of Max Holmes' deposition.? The deposition 
is not complete but the next sessions have not yet been scheduled.? We are 
not inclined to return to NY for further sessions of this deposition, unless 
Bruce MacLeod tells us he is going to ask questions about Enron, and then we 
will try to go only for that day.

well, we finally received from counsel for one of the co-defendants - after 
much hounding - the key filings from the previous shultes case . . . and it 
looks like our decision not to pitch in for a lawyer for nsm managment co. 
("nsm co.") was a smart move.  it turns out that when the plaintiff moved to 
add nsm co., our co-defendants' attorneys (who we have every reason to 
believe are going to effectively control nsm co's counsel) actually opposed 
the plaintiff's motion on the grounds, inter alia, that if the court allowed 
the amendment, THEY would have to bring in enron!  thanks a lot.  now we know 
where the plaintiff got the idea to sue enron.  thankfully, however, 
plaintiff's counsel disputed that enron was liable and would have to be 
brought in! you can be sure we will figure out a way to get these helpful 
statements into the motions we are drafting.

Richard: 

Tom Hatch (Robbins, Kaplan), Robin Diem (Hirschmann), and Steve O'Donnell 
(Piper, Marbury) asked questions today.? None was as aggressive as, nor had 
the presence of, Kathy Patrick.? However, Tom Hatch is quite good and 
definitely to be taken seriously.? The other two made little impression.

A lot of the questions today focused on Thai graft and corruption, with the 
suggestion that Busse, Stickler, and others (implicitly Enron) knew that it 
was there and did not really do anything to try to stop it.

A number of questions resulted in the appearance (perhaps true) that the 
Managment Company never really functioned, certainly not effectively.? The 
argument was NOT that the Management Company did not have enough power, but 
rather that the Management Company effectively abdicated, leaving everything 
to Schultes.

All of this made me slightly nervous.? I wonder if the bondholders could 
argue that the members of the Management Company has a fiduciary duty to the 
bondholders during the months after the offering to exercise the power that 
they had to stop graft and improve operations.? If there were such a legal 
duty (and there may well not have been), then the facts would probably not be 
good for the Management Company members.

In fact, the way that the Managment Company LLC agreement was structured, all 
power was in the hands of a single individual manager--David Stickler--and 
the only power that the members had was to remove Stickler (which would have 
required unananimity between ECT Thailand and SDI).? Although the Managment 
Company had a few "meetings," it is not clear what this means or, legally, 
who met at all, as the management Company had no board or governing body 
other than the individual manager.

Other themes: 

??????? SDI was having trouble with its own DRI facility and really wanted 
access to information about NSM's DRI facility.

??????? Everyone knew that John Schultes had no minimill experience (and 
might be corrupt) and that the project would fail unless Nucor or SDI agreed 
to run it, which neither did.? Stickler kept picturing SDI as managing NSM, 
but SDI steadfastly declined the role.

We should finish tomorrow.

Richard: 

Below you will find a list of some fifty-two depositions that have been 
scheduled in the NSM cases between now and non-expert discovery cutoff on 
January 19, 2001 (except for Heasley, for whom an exception has been made.)? 
So far, neither McConville nor Barth has been scheduled, and we are trying to 
keep it that way.

Of the currently scheduled 52 depositions, we are planning to attend 8:? 
McNamara (Cravath), Wheeler continuation (NatWest), Holmes (NatWest), Mellin 
(Farallon), Patel (Farallon), Cooper (Legg Mason), Clayton (White & Case), 
and Whitehead (Legg Mason' s advisor).

I have started to prepare for, and will participate in, the two Farallon and 
the two Legg Mason depositions.? I plan to ask my own questions to 
demonstrate that the witnesses had no oral communications with Enron, have no 
basis for believing that Enron played any roll in creating any documents or 
slides that they saw, and have no reason to think Enron would knowingly be 
involved in any inaccurate communications about NSM when Enron was investing 
$30 million of its own money in the company.

Richard: 

Kathy Patrick began Nolan's deposition today.? It was Nolan's first 
deposition and he seemed a little uncomfortable.? Nolan was overly cautious 
and at times evasive.? The highlights of the day were as follows:

--Nolan did not see the offering memo until he reviewed it on the way to 
Thailand in April '98.? Nolan was not privy to any discussions or road show 
presentations regarding the Notes prior to the closing (When Nolan was 
confronted with communications between himself and Serge Deslise of NSM in 
Jan. '98, he claimed he could not recollect why he would be communicating 
with NSM prior to the closing).

--When Nolan arrived in Thailand, he found a mill that appeared to be state 
of the art, but lacked raw materials and funds to produce steel.

--Nolan soon found that the Mill had serious engineering and management 
problems. 

--NSM had no financial controls until Aug. 98 when Stickler instituted a 
policy of requiring two signatures on disbursements.

Kathy spent a good deal of the day on an e-mail "situation report" sent by 
Nolan to Busse in May '98 discussing numerous problems with the Electric Arc 
Furnace, the Degasser and other parts of the mill.

Enron/ECT came up during the early portion of the deposition.? Patrick asked 
Nolan if he recalls discussing any aspect of the Mill with Brian Barth.? 
Nolan said he could not recall.? Patrick then asked him if he thought? Barth 
was an honest and competent person.? Nolan answered affirmatively.? It 
appears that Kathy is trying to lay the foundation for information she 
received from Brain during her interview. If Kathy continues focusing on 
Brian, however, it may begin to appear quite obvious to the other defendants 
that she has received information from Brian.?

Gustavo,

I spoke to Kevin about this.  I told him to let Steven Peters know if he 
calls again that we are planning to discuss this and all other matters with 
Ron in a comprehensive manner when we meet with him in Houston in the near 
future.

I keep getting emails from Steve Peters about the consent.  I have been
instructed to ignore them, but it seems like someone should give him a call.
Any further thoughts?

Kevin,

Are you all set with all paper work you needed? I had sent you originals of
the consents a few weeks ago and I believe Dick Robinson had to sign one of
the LLC consents yet. Done? Can you fax back a full signed set to me.

Thanks

Steve Peters

divide and conquer strategy devised with paul aronzon at milbank:
1. i am getting local thai counsel. have email richard out to bruce lundstrum 
re. we will file a claim even tho not submitted to cedrac procedures.
2.brian is getting a hold of jim ajello to have him call the other c 
bondholders to alert them as to the aug. 7 filing deadline since we were 
holding hands with them.
3.paul is calling cleary to document the handshake deal on what the c holders 
will get from the bs.
4.when that happens brian you and jim will need to call back the other c 
bondholders.
5.richard can you have the paralegal working on the case (was it linda?) pull 
the underwriting agreement, the shareholders agreement and the management 
agreement and anywhere else we think there may be an indemnity to file any 
indemnity claim we can think of? also can you do a short description of the 
lawsuit to put in the proof of claim??
6.paul is getting a general update of the status. of the case and the 
facility.

Dear Steve 

Thank you very much for your quick response. 

1.??? My suggested wording is just to make it quickly for the discussion. 
It will be appreciate if you could draft the specific wording for us then we 
will email it to White & Case. That will make the discussion between you and 
White & Case be easy and quick.? 

2.?? White&Case have not contacted us yet for today.? This afternoon, I will 
try to chase them to contact you quickly and try to get the name of the 
contact person at White&Case, U.S. for you. 

3.??? I understand your reason.? It is possible to postpone the meeting. 
After it seems that we cannot reach the agreed wording within this 
Wednesday, I will contact the official receiver and other parties to 
postpone the meeting for our witness.? 

4.??? I think they already received your memorandum because White&Case, 
Bangkok received it last Thursday.? 

By the way, I have a suggestion that you may not have to discuss with 
White&Case to much on the academic legal issues but we just need them to 
agree with our proposal of adding the condition in the application and let 
them agreed with your wording.

I very much like your idea of ECT's amending its claim to add a "condition" 
to the claim to accommodate W&C's position about the unenforceability of 
indemnity agreements vis-a-vis certain types of securities claims and not 
others.? Would you like me to draft some specific language.? (The language 
that you suggest in your e-mail is an excellent start, but it may need a 
little refinement in order to get White & Case to drop their objection.) 

Have you heard from W&C-Bangkok or W&C-US?? We have not.? I am available for 
a conference call almost anytime. 

I do not think it is practical for U.S. lawyers to get to Thailand for a 
conference on Friday in Thailand.? Thursday, Nov. 23, is a major family 
holiday in the United States (probably the second biggest holiday in the 
entire year here.)? I am extremely reluctant to ask any U.S. lawyer to 
disrupt major family plans to attend this conference.? Is there any way to 
postpone it? 

Has White & Case seen our memorandum about enforceability of indemnity 
claims.? That memo should go a long way toward showing W&C that we can 
probably reach agreement on this matter without lawyers having to travel to 
Thailand this week. 

Steve Howard

??????? Subject:??????? RE: ECT Securities : Indemnity claim 

??????? ??????????????? Dear Khun Peangpanor / Khun Kasemsi 

??????? ??????????????? We refer to our telephone discussion last Friday 
regarding 
the enforcement of the Indemnity Clause in the Purchase Agreement. 

??????? ??????????????? As discussed, we would like to have a telephone 
conference 
call among W&C Bangkok and U.S., Milbank and us.? With respect to the 
objective of the conference call, we would like to propose that we discuss 
and agree on the circumstances that the Indemnity Clause can be enforceable. 

Then we will put such circumstances as a condition in the application of 
E.C.T. Securities. 

??????? ??????????????? For example, our statement to the Official Receiver 
may say 
that "The applicant has accepted that the claim under this application can 
be enforceable to the debtor (NSM) only in case 
[..........................]". 

??????? ??????????????? We need only the exact wording to be agreed on 
between W&C 
U.S. and Milbank.? We are not sure that it is possible that we say that "... 

only in the case where the applicant has not been claimed against for 
reasons of fraud or willful misconduct."?? (We just put the condition in the 

application without having to prove whether in fact such condition has 
occurred or not.? This fact will be proved in the future.? In case where 
E.C.T. Securities would like NSM to make actual payment to it in the future, 

it has to prove to NSM that the condition has occurred.) 

??????? ??????????????? We note from W&C Bangkok that W&C U.S. may call 
Milbank for 
a discussion on this matter today.? However, if you please forward this 
email to W&C U.S. so that the US lawyers of W&C can discuss with Milbank via 

email also. 

??????? ??????????????? If we cannot reach the agreed wording by this 
Wednesday 
evening, Bangkok time, it seems that all of us may have to ask W&C U.S. and 
Milbank to attend the meeting with the official receiver in Bangkok this 
Friday.? It is very possible that, should the Official Receiver give an 
order in favour of either of us the case would be appealed to the court by 
the loser.? Such will incur lots of cost for both E.C.T. Securities and NSM. 

Therefore, an amicable resolution to this issue is in the interests of all 
parties. 

??????? ??????????????? If you have any question, please feel free to call 
us.

All parties have agreed to extend discovery cut off from 1/19 to 3/5/01, but
only for depositions of scheduled persons.  The "protected" list includes
Brian Barth, the person most knowledgable from ECT Securities, Julien Smythe,
and the person most knowledgable from Akin, Gump.  The list does not include
Kevin McConville.  I assume that ECT will designate Barth as PMK and that Akin
Gump will designate Smythe as PMK, so that we are talking about only two
depositions.

Trial dates and dispositive motion deadlines have not changed.

As a result of the the limited extension of discovery cutoff, plaintiffs want
to push Brian back to the week of January 29th or the week of February 5th. 
They are also making noise about Brian's deposition possibly taking four days.
 We may want to take the position that Brian will be there for three days and
no more.  That will ruffle a lot of feathers, and you and I should discuss it.

Hennegan has asked if I will represent Akin Gump and, if so, will I accept
service.  You and I should discuss this also.  Either way, we need to alert
Akin Gump what is going on.

Richard: 

Kathy continued with day 2 of Nolan's deposition.? She will conclude tomorrow 
and will be followed by M. Swartz and Corey Gorden from Robins, Kaplan.? Tom 
Hatch is apparently preparing for Aron Izower's (White & Case) deposition on 
Friday in New York.? Some of the defense counsel (in particular Michael 
Tomaino) have taken the position that if Nolan is still being deposed on 
Friday, they want Izower's deposition rescheduled.? Plaintiffs' counsel are 
holding firm but agreed to revisit the issue as we get closer to Friday.

Highlights of day 2: 

-- Nolan spent the bulk of the day discussing the numerous problems with the 
quality of the steel being produced during the time he visited the plant 
(April-June '98 timeframe).? Quality problems included oxidation, 
carbonization, edge cracks from too much copper, and coil breaks from too 
much heat.

--Nolan continued his description of the plant's engineering and mechanical 
problems 

--Nolan indicated that he was aware that NSM spent approx. $50 million to 
purchase scrap metal that was very poor quality (Nolan blamed the 
incompetence of NSM's manager Wolfgang Lentz)

--There wasn't much mention of Barth or McConville today.

well, we finally received from counsel for one of the co-defendants - after much hounding - the key filings from the previous shultes case . . . and it looks like our decision not to pitch in for a lawyer for nsm managment co. ("nsm co.") was a smart move.  it turns out that when the plaintiff moved to add nsm co., our co-defendants' attorneys (who we have every reason to believe are going to effectively control nsm co's counsel) actually opposed the plaintiff's motion on the grounds, inter alia, that if the court allowed the amendment, THEY would have to bring in enron!  thanks a lot.  now we know where the plaintiff got the idea to sue enron.  thankfully, however, plaintiff's counsel disputed that enron was liable and would have to be brought in! you can be sure we will figure out a way to get these helpful statements into the motions we are drafting.

Attached are (1) highlights from the fourth, fifth, and sixth days of 
Stickler's deposition and (2) a summary of what I have learned so far about 
the fees that Enron received in the transaction.

Because Stickler is dragging on, Roland will relieve me at the end of the day 
Monday and effectively lower the cost of Enron's having an attorney covering 
the deposition.? We think we do need some continuing presence at the 
deposition, because Stickler continues to testify about Enron's roll in the 
offerings from time to time; and we want to go back at the end and press him 
for specifics where he has alleged general participation by Enron.? We think 
Stickler will not be able to come up with anything specific when pressed and 
his general testimony will be exposed as bluster.

Dave,

Kevin McConville was deposed yesterday in Houston.  His rough transcript is
attached.

The deposition questioner jumped around and never went through the whole story
front to back, so you may not find this that helpful.  However, there is a
passage near the end where Kevin talks directly about Schultes' getting fired.
 You should be able to find this quickly by doing a word search on Schultes.
