FERC Enacts Major Constraints=20
on Wholesale Market



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis








AEP, Entergy Corp. and Southern Company told by FERC to charge cost-based p=
rices instead of market-based prices for wholesale spot transactions.=20

[News item from Reuters] The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FER=
C) voted 3-1 last week to adopt new rules to measure market power, as a con=
dition for approving mergers and granting utilities the right to trade powe=
r in the wholesale market. FERC commissioners said the new test would impro=
ve a system that allowed a meltdown to take place in the California market =
last winter, when wholesale power prices soared to record highs amid tight =
supplies. FERC commissioners agreed to produce a new market power test base=
d on supply margin assessments, which examines a company's importance in se=
rving peak electricity loads. "If you're big enough to control the market a=
t the time we look at it, you'll have mitigation put on you," said FERC Cha=
irman Pat Wood.=20

Analysis: Many participants in the wholesale sector of the energy industry =
are still reeling from FERC's new ruling, which may have slipped past some =
radar screens considering that it was issued right before the long holiday =
weekend. This is a mammoth ruling on FERC's part, however, and it holds tre=
mendous impact for those companies that increasingly find the lion's share =
of their profits coming from wholesale transactions. In addition, state reg=
ulators have also started gauging the impact of the ruling on retail rates,=
 which some utilities may seek to increase as a way to compensate for shrin=
king profits in their wholesale operations. While FERC has presented this r=
uling as an attempt to circumvent on the national level problems experience=
d in the California market, the new limits on wholesale transactions can al=
so be seen as another example of the "big stick" that the commission is usi=
ng to force utilities into participating in regional transmission organizat=
ions (RTO). Further, the ruling is another striking indication that Chairma=
n Wood is following through with his promise to monitor rampant wholesale m=
arkets while still attempting to support competition. The objective represe=
nts a tall order, and the new ruling from the commission is certain to prom=
pt intense resistance among companies involved in wholesale trading.=20

Put into a nutshell, FERC has ruled that some companies can no longer charg=
e unregulated, market-based rates for spot market wholesale transactions. I=
nstead, companies identified as having market power and that aren't part of=
 an approved RTO must charge cost-based prices for power that isn't committ=
ed in a long-term contract, and publicly disclose those cost-based prices. =
Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power (NYSE: AEP), Atlanta-based Sou=
thern Company (NYSE: SO) and New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) ha=
ve been singled out as case studies on which FERC will be immediately apply=
ing its new standards for wholesale transactions. Note that Mirant Corp., a=
 former subsidiary of Southern Company, has also been identified as having =
to submit information to FERC in order to gauge its level of market power s=
eparate from its former parent. The commission has essentially determined t=
hat these three utilities hold an unacceptable level of market power in the=
 areas in which they operate. Under FERC's new market power "test," a gener=
ator or marketer is viewed as having too much market power if its electrici=
ty is "pivotal" during peak demand, which enables the company to demand a p=
rice above competitive levels. Regional transmission constraints will also =
be considered now as a measurement of a company's market power. This is a d=
ramatic departure from previous standards, by which (under one of FERC's ma=
in criterions) a company that supplied less than 20 percent of the power ne=
eded in a particular region was freed from rate regulation on the federal l=
evel.=20

There are some important exceptions to the ruling. First, FERC has not elim=
inated the utilities' ability to charge market-based rates in areas where t=
he grid and markets are controlled by a FERC-approved RTO. This is signific=
ant, as I will expand upon subsequently, because it indicates that there ar=
e secondary objectives in FERC's new ruling. In addition, the current rulin=
g only impacts short-term sales transactions in which these three utilities=
 are involved. In other words, long-term contracts that the three companies=
 may have previously established or will establish in the future are not im=
pacted by the ruling. However, the three companies named in the ruling will=
 have to post pricing information related to long-term contracts, and FERC =
has retained the possibility that further price mitigation for long-term co=
ntracts may be necessary. Also note that the Western market, which already =
is under a price mitigation policy that FERC imposed in June, was not inclu=
ded in the new ruling.=20

The three utilities named in the ruling now have 15 days to submit proposal=
s to FERC outlining a transition to charging cost-based wholesale rates for=
 all power not currently committed to a buyer. Specifically, the utilities =
will have to post on their open-access same-time information systems (OASIS=
) the incremental cost of producing the uncommitted power during each hour =
in a 24-hour period. Moving forward, the price that the utilities can charg=
e for non-committed power on the spot market will be the difference between=
 their cost of production and the bid of more expensive power in the region=
 that their power displaces. The new cost-based rates must be administered =
by an independent third party.=20

The new pricing standards revert back to an older, cost-based technique kno=
wn as "split the savings." The methodology for this standard can get rather=
 complicated, but essentially under FERC's new ruling the three companies i=
dentified will have to post their cost-based, incremental costs for spot po=
wer into the OASIS system for viewing by potential purchases. Purchasers wh=
o want to make a bid will post their decremental energy bid for not produci=
ng or buying the power on their own. The final price for the transactions w=
ill be the split between the seller's incremental cost and the buyer's decr=
emental bid. For instance, if Southern Company bids its incremental cost at=
 $20/MWh and a purchaser bids its decremental cost at $30/MWh, the transact=
ion price would be $25/MWh. Assuming a midnight-to-midnight trading day, se=
llers would have to submit their incremental bid by noon on the previous da=
y and buyers would submit their decremental bids by 6 p.m. What this potent=
ially creates is an "information advantage" for buyers who have six hours t=
o evaluate and respond to the incremental bids from some sellers. Some of t=
he drawbacks to this system are that it requires both parties to post price=
 information that may not be readily available and it potentially allows th=
e purchaser to game the system by having access to the seller's original in=
cremental bid and competing around the seller's price.=20

Note also that in a separate development FERC simultaneously opened a broad=
 investigation under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act to apply the new =
market-based-sales policy to all U.S. sellers nationwide. What this means i=
s that, although only three utilities are mentioned in this initial order, =
it is expected that FERC will continue to take steps to constrain what it b=
elieves to be erratic wholesale markets. Reportedly, some 30 companies are =
awaiting similar reviews by FERC to determine if the commission believes th=
ey exert market power. The 206 investigation reportedly also requires power=
 providers with market-based sales authority to amend their tariffs within =
60 days to provide FERC with open-ended authority to order refunds if the c=
ommission determines that market manipulation has occurred.=20

I made a previous reference to the "big stick" that FERC is carrying relate=
d to participation in RTOs. Remember that a few months ago, Chairman Wood h=
ad threatened to deny utilities that refused to join an RTO the benefits of=
 charging market-based wholesale rates and swift approvals for merger appli=
cations, advantages that the chairman equated with the "new world" of the d=
eregulated energy market. With this in mind, note that only Southern Compan=
y, Entergy and AEP are included in the present ruling (although it may be s=
ubsequently expanded). Southern Company and Entergy in particular have exhi=
bited some resistance in following FERC's consolidation mandate regarding n=
ational RTOs, so it is probably not a mere coincidence that these three uti=
lities have been singled out. This must be particularly painful for Souther=
n Company, which gains a good part of its profits from wholesale trading an=
d previously expressed plans to double the size of its generation assets ov=
er the next five years.=20

Interestingly, Commissioner Linda Key Breathitt represented the single diss=
enting vote in the ruling. Breathitt's concern was that the ruling had been=
 pulled together too quickly and not enough time had been provided to evalu=
ate the impact on wholesale markets. This issue will undoubtedly be contest=
ed, and to a certain extent the utilities impacted by the ruling appear to =
have been caught off-guard. AEP, Entergy and Southern Company all issued st=
atements to the effect that they were uncertain about the extent to which t=
he ruling would impact them, and that they were reserving the right for pos=
sible litigation.=20

Moreover, to summarize the commission's rulemaking, I think there are a han=
dful of important points that should be considered. First, the ruling illus=
trates the steps that FERC is taking to revoke market-price authority that =
was for the most part unrestricted prior to the time that Pat Wood assumed =
his post as chairman. Second, FERC is implementing cost-based prices on the=
 spot market only, and in only very defined circumstances. However, this co=
uld be an indication that the commission may extend cost-based pricing to o=
ther wholesale transactions, including long-term contracts, at a later time=
. Third, the "split the savings" cost-based formula could become fraught wi=
th its own problems. Its requirements are rather complex and it offers the =
potential to give power purchasers a market advantage on the spot market ov=
er power sellers, which will now be required to post incremental costs in t=
he bidding process. Finally, one of the inherent drivers of FERC's new ruli=
ng is its desire to have large utilities join the RTOs that the commission =
has approved. It is very significant that the new ruling immediately impact=
s AEP, Entergy and Southern Company, utilities that have not only been deem=
ed by the commission to have market power in their regions but which have a=
lso not yet joined an approved RTO. However, even though only three compani=
es are immediately impacted by this ruling, it should not be overlooked tha=
t the ruling holds impact for the market as a whole as other sellers now wi=
ll gain important pricing information about the major suppliers in certain =
areas. Thus, overall this is a very significant ruling and one that could s=
ubstantially change the manner in which transactions in the wholesale power=
 market are conducted.=20

Hey Mike,
Just curious if you all have given any thought to posting a MEC Market.  You have
NSP and AECI and we would sure be interested in supporting a MEC market.
How the things going for you, I am sure right now it must be a bit tense 
In lieu of everything that is taking place with Enron.  
I wish you well and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

It seems so long since we were all together in early December.  Please don't forget that we will meet this Thursday January 3,  2002.
Please read Matthew 2. This is the story of the wise men and  their visit to Jesus. We will celebrate Epiphany next Sunday. Hope all of you  have a Happy and Safe New Year!

Mike,

When you evaluate your curves and scalars for the OG&E area, can you also make sure your Entergy long term curves and scalars are in good shape?  We will probably be using those for some load following possibilities and other long term deals such as heat rate options in the Entergy control area.  I assume the scalars would not be much different for either area, but I wanted to make sure they were both updated.

Thanks.

- Nick

INTERNAL COMMUNICATION REGARDING DELAYS 
IN RETAIL COMPETITION IN TEXAS
October 29, 2001

The main purpose of this memo is to inform EPMI and EES commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition Texas, particularly in non-ERCOT regions, which  include parts of the areas served by the following utilities:

?	Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) and West Texas Utilities Company (WTU) - both in the SPP region
?	      Entergy Gulf States (EGSI) - in the Energy-SERC region

As most of you probably have heard, the Texas Utility Commission has been examining, in the last few weeks, the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas. 

The Public Utility Commission of Texas (Staff) has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas, to start January 01, 2002.

There is a concern among the Commission and many other participants that non-ERCOT-Texas regions are not ready for competition. This concern has two major causes:
-	Lack of a vibrant, efficient wholesale market in those regions, where newly established REPs could have full access to others suppliers, on a non-discriminatory basis
-	      Lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in 2001 - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all; a recent hearing has confirmed most REPs absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being

SPP

Last Week, the Public Utility Commission decided to delay competition in SPP Texas. Or, more accurately, "to delay customer choice", in the Commission preferred language.  Enron, who was requested to file a testimony, opposed to any delays, under the argument that SPP is not a "perfect market", but REPs could trade in this market as other marketers do.

No final dates have been established yet. However, one estimates that the delay may vary from 12 to 18 months.

The Commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented:
-	Support SPP to begin wholesale market operations, which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems, such as settlement;
-	      Reform in SPP Tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management;
-	      Continue the pilot, attract new competitors and open the market.


As part of this effort, the Commission created a Southwest Power Pool Market Readiness Implementation Project (Docket # 24869) to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition, identify milestones, monitor progress and report to the Commission on a regular basis. Enron will be supporting this effort.


SERC

SERC regions bear resemblance with SPP, in terms of Commission's intent to delay competition. The most important difference is that the incumbent utility, EGSI, an Entergy subsidiary, has strongly supported timely implementation. The Commission fears that Entergy will benefit from its "monopolistic"  position in the region, in the absence of other REPs.

No final decisions have been made yet. Entergy Gulf States, in conjunction with the Commission Staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process, whereby retail competition will be delayed until September 15, 2002.

The subject is still being examined by the Commission and no final decisions have been made. However, we expect the Commission to approve the Settlement Agreement, therefore delaying competition until September 15, 2002.


ERCOT

All the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ERCOT Texas only.

There are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ERCOT-Texas, which is scheduled to take place on  January 01, 2002. For example, Nancy Hetrich from Enron, will be attending the Legislative Oversight Committee on Friday, November 02. She will be appearing in her capacity of Chair of RMS Sub-Committee.

Contrary to non-ERCOT, there is a strong support from  most industry participants to have retail competition on time. Besides, the results from the pilots were successful and ERCOT is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition. Therefore, unlike SPP and Entergy, there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ERCOT-Texas.

We will keep you apprised as things evolve.

Attached is a FERC Order issued today in Docket EL01-104-000.  The decision
concludes that, when ATC would permit, Transmission Providers must allow
firm redirection of long-term, point-to-point transmission service for
periods less than the remainder of the contract.  SPP's practice has been to
require that any redirection of transmission service on a firm basis should
be for the remaining balance of the term of service.  Effective immediately,
SPP is implementing the FERC Order for redirection of long-term,
point-to-point transmission service .  SPP's business practices will be
revised and posted on SPP's OASIS.  If you have any questions, please call
myself or Lanny Nickell.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Entergy has joined the SE Trans RTO (Southern, etal).  I will review the FERC filing; however, an Entergy rep called me today to ask for Enron's support stating that the new RTO proposal includes:
 
-- Independent Market Operator (he said such as PJM)
-- No Day Ahead Balanced Schedules
-- LMP
-- One OASIS and one Tariff (no separate tariff for Entergy's ITC)
-- One Security Coordinator
-- Initial license plate rate within Entergy area
-- local planning in Entergy footprint
 
He also said that they are trying to have the GridSouth group agree to use the same Independent Market Operator so there would be one market structure for the Southeast.
 
Hopefully, the filing reflects this -- more later.  Christi

Mike,

The change in the curves only shows a .60 increase today.  The curves were down anywhere from .60 to 1.65 previous which was supposed to be up .25.  Cin was up @ .15 today.  That would mean that ENT should be up at least the amount it was down the previous day plus any increase marked today.  Can you look into this for me.  This is causing a $2MM hit in the books down here.  Thanks.

-Joe

All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

We will need to be packed and ready to move for WEDNESDAY, 02/06/02 & THURSDAY, 02/07/02.  The move team will be moving our group during the day and the stenos will NOT be working until Monday, 02/11/02.


Also, please make sure that we LOGOFF again tonight...the IT group could not migrate us over the weekend due to incomplete items with legal.  They are going to try and take care of the migration tonight for the new UBS systems.


Thanks for your help.

Armstrong....this is all for you.

BAD AMERICAN
Date: Fri, 29 Jun 2001 Written by Ted Nugent, the rock singer
and hunter/naturalist, upon hearing that California
Senators B. Boxer and D. Feinstein denounced him for being a
"gun owner" and a "Rock Star".
This was his response after telling the senators about his past
contributions to children's charities and scholarship foundations
which have totaled more than $13.7 million in the last 5 years!!
"I'm a Bad American-this pretty much sums it up for me. I like
big trucks, big boats, big houses, and naturally, pretty women.
I believe the money I make belongs to me and my family, not
some midlevel governmental functionary with a bad comb-over
who wants to give it away to crack addicts squirting out babies.
I don't care about appearing compassionate. I think playing
with toy guns doesn't make you a killer. I believe ignoring
your kids and giving them Prozac might.
I think I'm doing better than the homeless.
I don't think being a minority makes you noble or victimized.
I have the right not to be tolerant of others because they are
different, weird or make me mad. This is my life to live, and
not necessarily up to others expectations.
I know what SEX is and there are not varying degrees of it.
I don't celebrate Kwanzaa. But if you want to that's fine;
I just don't feel like everyone else should have to.
I believe that if you are selling me a Dairy Queen shake, a
pack of cigarettes, or hotel room you should do it in English.
As of matter of fact, if you are an American citizen you should
speak English. My uncles and forefathers shouldn't have had
to die in vain so you can leave the countries you were born
in to come disrespect ours, and make us bend to your will.
Get over it.
I think the cops have every right to shoot your sorry butt if
you're running from them after they tell you to stop. If
you can't understand the word 'freeze' or 'stop' in English,
see the previous line.
I don't use the excuse "it's for the children" as a shield for
unpopular opinions or actions.
I know how to count votes and I feel much safer letting a
machine with no political affiliation do a recount when needed.
I know what the definition of lying is, and it isn't based on
the word "is"-ever.
I don't think just because you were not born in this country,
you qualify for any special loan programs, gov't sponsored
bank loans, etc., so you can open a hotel, 7-Eleven, trinket shop,
or any thing else, while the indigenous peoples can't get past
a high school education because they can't afford it.
I didn't take the initiative in inventing the Internet.
I thought the Taco Bell dog was funny.
I want them to bring back safe and sane fireworks.
I believe no one ever died because of something Ozzy Osbourne,
Ice-T or Marilyn Manson sang, but that doesn't mean I want to
listen to that crap from someone else's car when I'm stopped at a 
red light. But I respect your right to.
I think that being a student doesn't give you any more enlightenment
than working at Blockbuster or Jack In The Box.
I don't want to eat or drink anything with the words light, lite
or fat-free on the package.
Our soldiers did not go to some foreign country and risk their
lives in vain and defend our Constitution so that decades later
you can tell me it's a living document ever changing and is open
to interpretation. The guys who wrote it were light years
ahead of anyone today, and they meant what they said - now
leave the document alone, or there's going to be trouble.
I don't hate the rich. I help the poor.
I know wrestling is fake.
I've never owned, or was a slave, and a large percentage of
our forefathers weren't wealthy enough to own one either.
Please stop blaming me because some prior white people were
idiots - and remember, tons of white, Indian, Chinese, and
other races have been enslaved too - it was wrong for every
one of them.
I believe a self-righteous liberal Democrat with a cause is
more dangerous than a Hell's Angel with an attitude.
I want to know exactly which church is it where the
"Reverend" Jessie Jackson preaches; and, what exactly is
his job function.
I own a gun, you can own a gun, and any red blooded American
should be allowed to own a gun, but if you use it in a crime,
then you will serve the time.
I think Bill Gates has every right to keep every penny he made
and continue to make more. If it makes you mad, then invent
the next operating system that's better and put your name on
the building. Ask your buddy that invented the Internet to
help you.
I don't believe in hate crime legislation. Even suggesting
it makes me mad. You're telling me that someone who is a
minority, gay, disabled, another nationality, or otherwise
different from the mainstream of this country has more value
as a human being that I do as a white male. If someone
kills anyone, I'd say that it's a hate crime. We don't need
more laws! Let's enforce the ones we already have.
I think turkey bacon, turkey beef, turkey fake anything sucks.
I believe that it doesn't take a village to raise a child-it
takes a parent with the guts to stand up to the kid and spank
his butt and say "NO!" when it's necessary to do so.
I'll admit that the only movie that ever made me cry was Ole Yeller.
I didn't realize Dr. Seuss was a genius until I had a kid.
I will not be frowned upon or be looked down upon or be made
to keep silent because I have these beliefs and opinions.
I thought this country allowed me that right.
I will not conform or compromise just to keep from hurting
somebody's feelings.
I'm neither angry nor disenfranchised, no matter how desperately the
 mainstream media would like the world to believe otherwise.
Yes, I guess by some people's definition, I may be a bad American. But that's tough."

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Mike - It was great to see you again and thanks so much for helping in
the wedding.  It was pretty hectic & I wish I could have had more time
to spend talking with you.  I hope you had fun and enjoyed it as much we
did....pbw

Mike,

I'm glad to hear things are going well!  Everything at PwC is going pretty
good.  I'm still traveling quite a bit, today I'm in Indianapolis.  Laura
is keeping pretty busy at KPMG and working on re-decorating the house.
She's been talking a lot about having a baby so I'm not sure how long it'll
be before we have a little Duvall running around.  Hey, I just got a
message from Vogel on Pig Dinner, are you  planning on going this year?
Let me know because I'm going to try to make it finally, even though it's
on the worst day of the year for a tax accountant (April 13th).

Take Care,

Devin

   Mike,

   I was wondering how your job was going.  I've obviously heard all the
   media
   hype surrounding your company.  Please send me a email with an update.

   Thanks,

   Devin

his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the sco=

  , WR NYG - Kens Killers Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports=
, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will =
join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monda=

Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herma=

d the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kev=
in Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the=
 XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight=
 weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR =
TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his=
 back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return dat=

uel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking=

  Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily=

 from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.  =
  Brett Favre  , QB GB - Damons Doormats Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped T=
uesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this w=

nis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this wee=
k were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star=
 notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There=

ts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to =
the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's p=

 Woltys Wonders Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is exp=

 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning J=
urevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter =
in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. T=
here is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani =
Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongsi=

inst Arizona. "He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some=
 things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available," sai=
d head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more =
playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updat=
ed 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game again=
st the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playi=
ng. He is recovering from a sprained foot. "We're expecting some limited pr=
actice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that=
 it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days," said head c=
oach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/=
24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's =

aghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering f=
rom a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as=
 probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free Agent Up=
dated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach=
 Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon=
 as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. "We'll cross that=
 bridge when we come to it," Holmgren said. "I would be surprised if I didn=
't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hu=
rt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that=
 when Ricky can play, he'll play again." If you have the roster room, it wo=

sselbeck  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be the S=
eahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to=
 the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in fo=
r Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very fav=
orable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him =
this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - DeWaynes Demons Updated 10/23/01   =
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Caro=
lina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concuss=
ion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Ag=
ent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. =
He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy=
 player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Drunk Monke=
ys Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury.=
 He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use =
him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Woltys Wonders Updated 10/23/01 =
  Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead =
of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend=
 you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hard=
ly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  =
  Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might mi=
ss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right =
foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Commissioner=
 Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas C=
ity due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league =
this week.    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - Jugg or Nuts Updated 10/23/01   Dav=
is is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback gam=
e from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether =
they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos =
hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you us=

serve WR Updated 10/24/01  The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured rese=
rve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his =
season.    Rob Moore  , Reserve WR Updated 10/23/01  According to Cardinals=
 coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season.=
 Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have set=
backs in his recovery. "I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the=
 Arizona Republic . "That's why we both handled it like we did in training =
camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't=
 tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, =
we won't have him." If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the ti=
me to let him go.    Freddie Jones  , Active TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones spr=
ained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Michae=
l Pittman  , Active RB Updated 10/21/01  Pittman had a great outing on Sund=
ay against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown.=
 Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a=
 valuable player to have on your roster.    LaDainian Tomlinson  , Active R=
B Updated 10/21/01  Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this sea=
son by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on th=
e day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.    Ahma=
n Green  , Reserve RB Updated 10/19/01  Green will get the bulk of his numb=
ers in the second half if Green Bay can get ahead of Minnesota early. He wi=
ll definitely be good for at least one TD.    Shannon Sharpe  , Active TE U=
pdated 10/19/01  Expect Sharpe to have another solid week, as far as tight =
ends are concerned. He is the team's leader in receptions and should get a =
reasonable amount of balls thrown his way. Don't be surprised if he scores =
a touchdown as well. Sharpe is overdue for a score. He had five TD catches =
in 2000 but hasn't scored one this season.    Kurt Warner  , Active QB Upda=
ted 10/18/01  Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis=
, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against =
the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.    Torry Ho=
lt  , Active WR Updated 10/18/01  Holt has the potential to post big number=
s against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wi=
deout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.    Mark Brun=
ell  , Reserve QB Updated 10/17/01  Brunell is no longer being bothered by =
headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for ov=
er 200 yards and a score.    Vikings  , Reserve DT Updated 09/26/01  The Vi=
kings signed former Buffalo safety Henry Jones this week. He'll replace Rob=
ert Griffith, who broke his leg during Sunday's game against Chicago. The m=
ove won't make Minnesota's secondary much better than it was, however, and =
doesn't improve the unit overall from a Fantasy perspective.    Steve Chris=
tie  , Reserve K Updated 09/11/01  According to published reports, Christie=
 has been released by the Buffalo Bills. Christie, who was placed on injure=
d reserve due to a groin injury last week, will have an MRI on Tuesday. Dro=
p Christie now if you haven't already done so, and consider picking up Jake=
 Arians, who has taken over the placekicking duties in Buffalo.    Travis P=
rentice  , Reserve RB Updated 09/03/01  Prentice was traded to the Vikings,=
 where he might see some work as a No. 2 RB, at best. He's not worth a Fant=

Listed below are some of the positions available. You can also look at our postings on the PMA website for updates each week. If you're willing to look at positions outside Houston, we have some excellent opportunities. 
To make sure we stay in touch, drop us an email with the personal email address or telephone number where we might reach you.  
Rockwood Associates has been exclusively recruiting for domestic energy clients since 1985.  We started by bringing Wall Street quantitative specialists of all levels to physical energy marketing and trading companies.  Today, much of our power and natural gas search work breaks into three areas: (1) risk management and quantitative analysis, (2) structuring/planning, and (3) select assignments in physical power and gas trading.  Other functional areas served: energy consulting, and derivatives marketing.    
We're always looking for individuals with strong analytical foundations for various positions. 
Experienced Financial Traders We have specific job openings in at least two locations outside of Houston for candidates with experience in power or natural gas OTC markets.  These jobs complement the physical trading done in various US markets and the trader either hedges or takes proprietary positions. 
These jobs range from a mid-range job which offers total comp of $275-375K/yr or so to a more highly leveraged position where the person can make more for both the team and him or herself.  
One should have a minimum experience of derivatives trading of two years, and someone with more than 7-8 can be utilized as well.  Strong options knowledge is a must.  
Power Marketing (EastCoast) This client firm is expanding into additional regions and needs someone with ECAR and adjacent grid experience.  Candidate should have five or more years in the industry, have an in-depth knowledge of the power business and be respected in the power community. Client is a stable, solid power marketer with five years of systematic growth and management continuity.  Firm has generation in various regions and can design and support structured transactions.  The position offers all that a sales person might want: management support, a strong incentive plan and a good combination of personal responsibility and freedom to develop a marketplace in a systematic way. 
Term Marketer For Natural Gas  (East Coast Location) A firm with excellent structuring/analytical support is looking for origination people with solid backgrounds in selling and structuring longer-term deals.   Candidate should have customer contacts that are LDC's, power generators and large industrials in the Midwest. Be part of a small, tight-knit group that can use someone with good credentials and reward them accordingly.   
Energy Derivative Marketers (West Coast/East Coast) We have several openings for those who know derivatives and have successfully sold to energy producers and users.  The right individual will have at least 2 years of experience and must be presently active in the marketplace.  These are great positions for an independent-minded marketer who wants to build his/her own business within a business.  The position will have terrific support from creative derivatives structuring groups.

The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast P=
ower Grid platform that resulted from the mediation.=20
=20
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Mo=
del (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remainin=
g unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  Ho=
wever, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its de=
termination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a =
platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  =
There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should enc=
ourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by t=
he parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FER=
C orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down=
).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a m=
odel and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit =
a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that pa=
rties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she reco=
mmends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproduc=
tive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission=
 will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject he=
r recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission=
 would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-t=
ype discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our sugg=
ested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of=
 the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholde=
r participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  Wh=
ile she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not ad=
opt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day =
2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).
=20
The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the G=
rid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (with=
out any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed cha=
nges to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest=20
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative pr=
ocess which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, r=
egardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC=20
Her opinion is that the "Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility s=
ponsored) Model" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion managemen=
t) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements=
 of Order No. 2000 based on a "best practices" analysis of other RTOs and C=
ommission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid =
model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, et=
al.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) =
in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model i=
s not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid phy=
sical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements a=
nd LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsib=
ilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below:=20
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and =
an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was a=
dded to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission ow=
ner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission =
solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would a=
dminister the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission=
 system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and tra=
nsmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She str=
ongly encourages this split.=20
Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) =
and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets=20
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), wi=
th RTO oversight=20
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control=
 areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pur=
suant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that con=
solidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be=
 subject to further discussion)=20
RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including=
 rate changes and tariff filings=20
All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has=
 appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their =
rights should they win on appeal)=20
4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and G=
ridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant t=
ransmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existin=
g facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those abo=
ve).  There will be one "through and out rate", plus a Grid Management Char=
ge for RTO operation.=20
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT=20
Financial Rights/LMP (includes "real time spot market") is clearly the pref=
erred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many =

Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many a=

d had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to=
 the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the "economies of s=

 In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process=
 that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shiftin=
g:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allo=

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the =

Family,

With the recent tragedy, I am unsure when the following invitation will
arrive to you via the US Mail.  As many of you know, the US Mail is highly
dependent upon our nation's airline system for the normal on-time delivery of
cross country mail (normally within 3 to 4 days) which is mailed over
approximately 600 miles.  For the time being (and not sure when the
prohibition will be lifted) the nation's passenger carrying domestic and
international aircraft will not be allowed to fly mail or cargo in the cargo
holds. This measure may go away soon or measures be made for increased x-ray,
etc.  However, this may result in delays of mail depending upon how much the
trucking and rail industry can "absorb" in the cross country movement.  The
following invitations to the upcoming Change of Command were mailed on
Tuesday, 12th Oct by the office of the Wing Commander of the 436th Airlift
Wing (Dover Air Force Base, DE) who will be "my boss".

I felt it best to send this e-mail just in case the invitation does not
arrive for weeks.  I hope you understand.  As I reflect on the weeks ahead of
taking command of the flying operations and port operations of this nation's
largest military aerial port and strategic airlift wing we are humbled about
the talents of the great many men and women of this operations group as they
fly our nation's most precious and important cargoes to all faces of this
world through times of peace, contingency and if need be war.

Content of the Invitation follows:

Kenny and Jan

Just a reminder that we are coming up to the end of the year and that you will be able to roll over 40 HOURS or ONE WEEK of vacation time.  Should you have more that 40 hours please try and use them before the end of the year so that you don't loose them.  I do have a print out of the vacation time if you need to verify your current balance.

Thank you,

Subject:	N. Little Rock Metering

Below is a summary of the metering issues for N.Little Rock.

Entergy is requiring NLR to supply all metering.  There are several meters already in place but more are needed.  James Bray is the contact with the metering information.  All existing meters are pulse contact meters and the metering is brought back to NLR's SCADA system via a radio network.  Benton has pulse meters in place but the pulse data is not currently brought back to the SCADA system.  For now, meter readers have to go out to each meter with a laptop and tie it into the meter to get readings.  The best solution would  be to have all of the meters brought back to the central SCADA system.  The peak load for NLR is 260MW, the peak for Benton is 65MW.

The biggest issue is the generation at the hydro station.  There is currently 40 MW of generation from two 20MW units.  These units are flow following; the generation is controlled by the flow of water in the river.  NLR has no control over the water flow.  It is controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers.  The CoE currently sends out forecasts of water flow but it is not accurate.  Right now, the control system at the hydro plant is not connected to NLR's SCADA system.  They do have a fiber network in place and the hydro plant can be connected.  NLR has to pay Entergy an imbalance charge mostly caused by the change in generation at the hydro plant.

Assuming that NLR can get all of the meter data and the hydro plant data back to the SCADA computer, I think that the best course of action for us is to connect a near real-time connection to the SCADA computer to get data back to Houston.  This is a system similar to what we installed at Clarksdale.  For an estimate of costs, use $50,000 for installation and $1,000 per month for communications.  This is for a file server at the site of the SCADA computer with a frame relay connection back to Houston.  With this we can monitor the NLR load as well as the hydro generation on a near real-time bases (+/- 5 seconds).

James Bray is supposed to call me with more information on the metering and control systems.  However, if you get the chance, please try to find out the following information:

1)  How many more meters need to be installed?

2)  What will it take to get the Benton meters tied back to the SCADA computer?

3)  Is there any generation control at the hydro plant or is it totally dependent on water flow?  In other words, can they control the pitch of the rotors, open or close valves, divert water, etc.  to control the total generation?

4)  Less importantly, what type of SCADA system to they have and what is the platform?  Platform - Windows NT, Unix, Windows 2000, Windows 95 (Gasp), etc.  Software - GE Harris, WonderWare, Intellution, etc.

Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, "live" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market "News" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. "storm in the gulf").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power

Starting tomorrow, 11/28/01 we will be included with the Gas Breakfast and Lunches.  However, there will be a cost of $5.00 each or $10.00 total when breakfast is provided.  They will have lunch everyday and breakfast only three days of the month, which will be during bid week.  

I will come around every morning and collect your money...I will then have to provide a list to the Gas people who will be checking your name off as you enter the breakfast/lunch line.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

REMEMBER...ONLY THOSE WHO GIVE THE $5.00 WILL BE EATING.

Thanks for your cooperation,

Subject: Access Card Information

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Scrubbers Planned For Four TVA Coal Plants

The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) recently unveiled plans to cut SO2 emissions by equipping four of its
coal-fired generating facilities with flue-gas desulfurization systems. The $1.5 billion project will add
single scrubbers at TVA's Bull Run, Paradise, and Colbert plants, and a pair of scrubbers at the utility's Kingston
facility. Equipping the five units with sulfur controls is expected to lower TVA's SO2 emissions by 200,000 tons per year, the utility said.

TVA is also in the midst of a $1 billion program to reduce NOX emissions at its plants by constructing 18 selective-catalytic-reduction systems (SCRs) on 25 coal-fired generating units.  Design work on the new scrubbers will start in 2003. Peak construction activities will have to be delayed, however, until the SCR-installation program is finished. The utility noted that a lack of availability of craft workers and other resources needed to install the emissions-control equipment will affect the completion date (AD 7/18/01). TVA didn't provide an estimated completion date for the scrubber project.

TVA has already installed scrubbers on six of its coal-fired generating units, including two each at Cumberland,
Paradise and Widows Creek.

You might want to check www.kstatefootball.com  to get some  comments about the Oklahoma game.  Also, Audrey Mross of Dallas has  received some information on www.huskerfootball.com  that is very  interesting.  In case we are looking forward to November 10, she passed  that news along.
 
DON'T FORGET WATCH PARTY THIS SATURDAY AT SRO -  NORTHWEST SHOPPING MALL.
 
DON'T FORGET FOURTH ANNUAL "SUNFLOWERS AND  SAGE" BBQ ON OCTOBER 14
 
We'll be at the Colorado game this  Saturday.  I'm sure you'll spot us among the purple people!
 
See you later,
 
Joyce Nesmith

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001

What a cute baby squirrel!  How old is the little man?  Does he walk yet? I
 'm in Kansas right now...working for my Dad for a couple of weeks(and deer hunting), and am headed up to Manhattan tomorrow night......

I haven't done that in quite awhile!!  I am meeting Ruge and a few other KC Fiji boys, and Blair is coming from Denver.  I haven't been to Manhattan in 3 years or so, and haven't been to a KState f-ball game(in Manhattan) since the 97' season!  It's homecoming, so it should be a pretty fun weekend...of course now that I'm 10 years older than most of the kids there, I may have to be careful I don't get arrested for Child Molesting!!
haha

How's everything else treating you?  I am headed back to Vail around the 5th of Nov., to drive snowcats for the winter....
actually that's my night job....and the job that gets me my insurance and ski pass....I am getting a few photography deals going, so I will be doing that during the daylight hours(oh yeah...and skiing alot!!hehehe).

I actually check my codydownard@hotmail.com account more than this one, so start using that one por favor..

Let me know how everything is going!!

Perge!

Hey Cat Fans - Saturday was sort of a  disappointment - but life goes on.  I have just heard, unofficially, that  the KSU/A & M game on the 20th WILL BE televised.  I had been concerned  that the way both teams played Saturday that the game might not make it on the  tube.  However, the time of the game has not been determined.  Will  have to let you know later what time to come to the SRO on the  20th.
 
In the meantime, we have our big  "Sunflowers and Sage" dinner on Sunday night.  If you have your  registration form and have not sent it in yet,  just come and pay at the  door.  We have a good time with our auction and all proceeds go to our  scholarship fund, which helps a needy student.
 
So, until Sunday - 
 
GO  CATS

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Mike -

We spoke briefly on the phone yesterday about creating a ticker story for your new East Power product, but I haven't received any further info from you. 

If you would like to go ahead with this, please send a brief description of the new product and the date it will be launching on EnronOnline.

Thanks,

When is it? He told me about it, but I can't remember when it is.

Are you going?

How's everything going?  Wife, kid--good?  Not much here...I'm have started selling photos to a few magazines and to some realtors.

No girlfriend, not going out very much at all, doing alot of mtn. bike races, climbing alot of mtns., taking alot of photos, and enjoying life in the mtns.--that's pretty much what's been happening in my life.

Talk to you later,

  <br>
  On playing KU, a rival school:
I would like to think, no matter who you were going to line up, that there would be a tremendous amount of motivation to become better, to have success. I think that's why we play the game, I think that's why youngsters play the game, and I think under any circumstances that they would be motivated to do so. I would hope that it would be that way. Does that make it true or not? Not necessarily, I think what you say, John, makes sense that if there is a need for additional motivation beyond what they have, maybe this traditional rival game could provide that.

After giving this trade situation WAY too much  thought,
I have arrived at the following conclusions (giving  examples
along the way so blockheads like DeFoggi can  understand
the concepts).
 
1.) One suggestion is to have the online trading  system 
allow first come, first serve between specified  hours/days
as allotted by the website. Unfortunately, the  reality is
that this won't work because there are available  free agents
on MY team and the only way to add/drop is that I  become
notified anyway and go in and manually do the  transaction
and waive the fee. 
 
2.) Power ratings so that the low man on the totem  pole
gets a chance for first pick. Okay, so a  trader makes a 
bad trade, loses money, gets fired, and then  gets the same
job trading elsewhere for more money. A loser is a  loser and
should be acknowledged as such (see Feeley). Those  are the
breaks in this game. Besides, too time consuming  for me to
go through the numbers.
 
3.) Free market... first come, first served,  anytime, anywhere.
This is a good concept in that those  that dedicate the time to
watching, studying, and anticipating an opportunity  are allowed
to seize the moment and get paid. And they should  because it
is just like a small business, you get out of it  what you put into
it. Time is money. However, you can't do  add/drops once your
lineup is set and you should only be able to apply  trades to the
upcoming week anyways. 
 
4.) Calling two fellow team owners to  validate your trade. Really,
would you trust Gibby in this situation? I can hear  it now, "Oh yeah,
dude, I was drinking a soder pop when he  called but he neva said
anything about picking up that QB." 
 
So, I have reached what I call a fair and amicable  solution to all
of your f*cked up problems.
 
First, the core of someone's team is going to  decide the results
week in and week out. I've been in this long  enough to know that
pickups (especially in a big league) are rarely  gonna make that
big of a difference in the outcome of a  season. Past examples 
include WR Thrash who had a spectacular  game against Seattle
only to turn around and have a dismal game against  the lowly
Cowboys. There was $15 given to the  pot. What I am getting at
is that I think trading is way overrated and only  serves to build the
pot for the team that drafted  the strongest in the beginning anyways.
 
Second, online access allows a level playing  field. I agree with this
and it should be implemented because it is  also time stamped so 
there is no question as to who was first in a  selection. If an owner
is going to stoop so low as to change the  clock on their computer
to try and get an earlier time stamp, then there  are bigger mental
problems down the road and the money you make off  the win should
be applied accordingly.  
 
Third, my time is just as important and so is a "transaction" period.
For example, this weekend is Octoberfest weekend in Fredericksburg. 
If you think I am going to hang around and stay sober so I can meet 
your demands and implement your requests, you are sorely mistaken. 
I fully expect to start drinking myself into oblivion Friday evening  and 
don't expect to come out of my coma until sometime Sunday  evening
so your changes/requests/questions need to be done by Friday  afternoon.
 
SO, here is what I suggest:
 
1.) to make an add/drop (trade) transaction, click on the "Owners"  tab
on the league homepage (found up top next to Live Chat), page down
to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast  email to ALL team members
announcing your intentions. I will implement  the trade(s) on the Tuesday following
the Monday night game. The transaction  deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the weekend
games. If I receive the email timestamped before  then, I will make the trade for
the upcoming weekend. IF there is a Thursday night  game, Thursday 5:00 PM
is the deadline for THE WEEKEND. At any time after the deadline if a transaction
is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend. Also, there will be NO limit on
the amount of transactions, feel free to contribute  as much as you wish.
 
2.) regarding current requested trades for the past  weekend: for this week only,
send ME an email with your request. I will  take one trade per team this week
only. If two teams want the same free agent,  whoever guesses closes to where the
Nasdaq composite closes Wednesday, October 3rd  wins. The loser will be notified
as such. So, BE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR GUESS.     
 
This should provide everyone easy online access to making trades. All you  have 
to do is make sure the free agent is indeed free, that nobody has already  sent you
an email picking him up, and shoot a broadcast out to the owners  proclaiming 
him as yours. Simple. 
 
So, any questions or concerns can be sent back to discuss. I will shoot  down all
of them. I am going to lunch. I eagerly await the opportunity to tell you  why your
plan won't work.
 
Craig, the commish

Hi Everyone,

The World Wide RibFest "celebration of the Rib" is coming up.  This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).  I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.

For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).  A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a "peoples choice" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).  

Every year, my wife asks the following: 	"So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?"
			          I reply:	"Nothing comes to mind."	
		               She replies:	"No." 

As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.  So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.  The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.  The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.

There are a couple of changes to this year's competition:
The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire
Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing "personal reasons"

Date & Time
Saturday November 3rd.  We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
		
Where
4807 Elm Street in Bellaire

Directions (from John Mee himself)
>From downtown, take 59s to 610s. The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit. Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April. Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building. Right before that building is Elm Street. Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street. Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS
Bring 'em!  We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.  The more kids the better.

What you need to bring
Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

RSVP
Call 	John and Laura  713 839 8700 -or-
	Greg and Martha 713 861 2766
We need to make sure we stock up enough ribs to go around.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

They all were released on $5,000 bonds, except for Hudson, who also was arrested for DUI. His bond was $5,500.Police responded to the scene at approximately 5 a.m. Sunday after one of the women called to report the disturbance. The three men had already fled the scene. One woman described the vehicle to the police, who tracked it down.The undergarments, which were worth a total $50, were recovered.President of ATO Lance Jones said the houses had been involved in a series of pranks against each other."We're doing our best to make sure this won't happen again," Jones said.

We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our "live" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for "external" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Subject: RTO Week -- Summary of Day One Panel


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues in both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.  

Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />

The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).  

Energy Spot Market

There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.  

Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules

Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.

ICAP Requirement

Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton -- University of MD) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).  

Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.

 Standardized Markets

 Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.

Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.

Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets

The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).

This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.

Mandatory Markets

Other than Ed Cazalet (APX), the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.

 ICAP

 Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.

Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.

Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?  Most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.

Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.

Please call me with questions or comments.

The word is out!  The KSU game with Texas A  & M will be telecast at 11:30 this coming Saturday.  There will be a  Watch Party at the SRO in Northwest Mall starting promptly at 11:30.  Hope  many of you can be there.  The Wildcats need our help against the Fighting  Farmers from College Station. But we can do it!  
 
Hope you will come out and support the  team!
 
GO CATS!
 
Our Alumni Club had a fun night last night at  Jillian's for our annual "Sunflowers and Sage" scholarship  benefit.  About 60 were there.  Wish more of you could have  come!  We always have a great time with Dan Lauck and Matt Musil as our  emcees and Matt is our very persuasive and fun auctioneer!   You  missed a fun and informative talk by Zac Burton '00, back-up quarterback.   A great time was had by all!  Ken and I want to thank our committee for  their help and for all who participated in the auction.  
 
We'll be in Manhattan for the Aggie game - watch for  us!

We finally got signed up with a internet service provider.  I have
attached a business card with our current pertinent information.  If for
some reason the card doesn't work, drop one back and I will just send
the info.  Hope all is well with everyone.  Tina and I have a joint
email as well.  It is cntspain@swbell.net.

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Louise

All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from "ambushes" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may "only" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Subject: RE: RTO Week -- Summary of Congestion Management Panel



 RTO Week

Day 2 -- October 16, 2001

Congestion Management and Transmission Rights

The morning panel discussion was on congestion management.  The panelists w=
ere:  Nancy Brockway, Commissioner New Hampshire PSC; Reem Fahey, Edison Mi=
ssion; Carol Guthrie, Chevron/Texaco; Shmuel Oren, University of California=
 - Berkley and advises Texas PUC; Andy Ott, PJM; Michael Schnitzer, NorthBr=
idge Group.

General Observations

The Commissioners were again all present (Wood left mid-morning to give tes=
timony on Capitol Hill).  Today, however, FERC Staff was much more active i=
n the discussion and the commissioners asked very few questions.  The topic=
s are so interrelated that many of the same issues already discussed are be=
ing rehashed again.  This will probably continue for the rest of the week. =
 What I have found most encouraging so far has been the widespread support =
for some of the basic concepts, most notably the need for a real time energ=
y market based using LMP.  Very few panelists have opposed this; at most, a=
 couple of panelists have argued that the real time market should not be st=
andardized -- basically conceding that PJM's system will be implemented in =
the Northeast but urging that it not be mandated everywhere else.   =20

Locational Marginal Pricing

The panelists all agreed that LMP in the real time market is necessary (Sch=
muel Oren does not oppose it).  Most of the panelists think this needs to b=
e standardized across RTOs.  Andy Ott says the seams will remain a problem =
and a barrier to trading if the real time market is not standardized.   Car=
ol Guthrie does not favor standardization and urged FERC to not standardize=
 the PJM system throughout the eastern interconnect.  She said FERC should =
try a couple of different systems and see what works. =20

FTRs versus Flowgates

The panelists agreed that transmission rights should be financial, not phys=
ical.  Schmuel conceded this point for the discussion but this may not be h=
is preference - unclear.  Most of the panelists, including the PSC commissi=
oner, prefer FTRs rather than flowgates.  Schmuel is a flowgate advocate.  =
After some discussion, the panelists agreed that FTRs and flowgates could w=
ork together, provided that the definition of flowgate is understood.  Andy=
 Ott said flowgates could work with FTRs if the purpose of having flowgates=
 is the same purpose of having hubs (liquidity, standard product), and if a=
 flowgate is defined as a grouping of point-to-point rights, then FTRs and =
flowgates can coexist.  If a flowgate is a hub for transmission rights, it'=
s okay.  However, if flowgate is defined as a physical boundary requiring s=
cheduling, the two cannot coexist.  Schmuel seemed to agree with this premi=
se, although this is not his preference.  He seems to prefer only flowgates=
 without FTRs.   Brockway seems to prefer FTRs rather than flowgates for fe=
ar that flowgates will result in excess socialization of costs.

The panelists also agreed generally that revenues generated from FTRs or fl=
owgates should be allocated to load, but the method of allocation was not a=
greed upon.

FERC staff asked the panelists to discuss commercially significant flowgate=
s.  Many of the panelists discussed the problem with deciding what constitu=
tes a commercially significant flowgate, and what happens when circumstance=
s change over time, resulting in different flowgates being commercially sig=
nificant.  Schmuel said you could use either a system that relies only on c=
ommercially significant flowgates or one that uses all flowgates, but if pa=
rticipants are willing to accept a system where they are not perfectly hedg=
ed, use of commercially significant flowgates is acceptable. =20

The panelists agreed that these financial rights (either FTRs or flowgates)=
 should be tradable in the secondary market.  The panelists disagreed on wh=
ich instrument -- FTRs or flowgates -- are more tradable.  Andy thinks FTRs=
 are more tradable; Schmuel thinks flowgates are more tradable.

Options versus Obligations

The panelists discussed the benefits of having FTRs be options but also dis=
cussed the additional problems presented to the system operator if FTRs are=
 only options and the FTR holder is not required to flow or pay if it does =
not flow.  Andy Ott said options will most likely result in fewer FTRs bein=
g allocated.  Schnitzer says the issue must be resolved up front. =20

The afternoon panel was on Transmission Planning and Expansion.  Steve Walt=
on was a panelist and will be providing a summary of the discussion shortly=
. =20

Let me know if you have any questions.

Dear Class,
The POV is having a guest speaker who is the equivalent of a  priest in Islam.
I had to leave last week before I could tell you that due to  the blood drive we would have to meet somewhere else for this coming Sunday. So,  we will meet in the GYM for Sunday School.
