  Hi Robin,

  Congratulations on signing up for the best test prep course
  available! As part of your course, you get enhanced access to
  The Princeton Review's award-winning web site. Below is some
  important  information to help you use these services. Be sure
  to save this email for future reference.

  NEW TO THE WEB?
  ---------------
  If you are not too familiar with using the Web, you should
  check  out "Web 101" at the HotWired site. It's a great
  resource that'll answer just about every question you could
  have about the Web. You can find it at:

        http://www.hotwired.com/web101

  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  -------------------
  To use all of the features on the website, you'll need the
  following:

  SAT and GMAT students:

   Web Browser:
 ------------
 PC Users will need Internet Explorer version 5.0 and above
 or Netscape Navigator 4.7 or above.
 MAC Users will need Netscape 4.7 or above.
 JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this.

 Finally, you=01,ll need a Flash and Acrobat enabled browser.  If
 you do not have these, you need not worry.  Simply click on the
 Requirements Check link after Logging In and clicking on the
 same link off of the Getting Started Page.  The Online check
 will allow you to download all necessary plug-ins.

 Modem:
 ------
 56 kbps or faster

  Students preparing for all other tests:

 Web Browser:
 ------------
   Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 4.0 or
   higher. JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this. For best
   results, we recommend using Netscape. If you need to download
   a new web browser, you can do so at the following address:

         http://www.netscape.com/download/

   Modem:
 ------
   28.8 kbps or faster

  LOGGING IN
  -----------
  Whenever you go to the Princeton Review website
  http://www.princetonreview.com, you should click on the "Course
  Students Click Here" button that appears at the top of each
  page. To enable your course services, simply enter your
  username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.
  For your records, here are the username and password you
  selected when you registered:

       USERNAME: robin.rodrigue@enron.com
       PASSWORD: 7@hzq*hq

  LOGGING OUT
  -----------
  If you are using a public computer, like one in a library or
  dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your
  work on the website. All you have to do is click on the "Log
  Out" link that appears on every page after you log in.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  -----------------------------
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
"real"
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  ------------------
  Tech support is available at no charge to all Princeton Review
  course students Monday through Friday from 10am until 11pm
  Eastern and Saturday from 12pm to 6pm Eastern. You can reach
  tech support by either phone or email:

       Tech Support Email: websupport@review.com
       Tech Support Phone Number: 1-800-546-2102

  Once again, thanks for choosing The Princeton Review. You are
  well on the way to higher scores!

  Regards,
  The Folks at Princeton Review Online

understood it....b/c I sure didn't!!  I have no idea what you're trying to

Either they have spare time or they are doing it in their sleep.  I really 
don't want to think of anyone I know here working on having babies.  I say 
that and yet I know Tracy is trying to get pg.  She says she is tired of 
always having her legs in the air.  I know she doesn't have any spare time.  
Maybe she utilizes her time by doing two things at once.  Like eating dinner 
and you know...... Or like, heck I don't know.  My brain is mush.  See ya.  B

Beginning this week an Origination report will be given to Fred Lagrasta each 
morning.  The information for this report is taken from the Origination 
schedule tab of your P&L file.  It is imparative that all the information is 
filled out for each origination granted.  The item most commonly overlooked 
is deal volume.  There is also additional information that is now required 
for all Middle Market Nymex Originations.  

Please add the following columns to your Origination Schedule:
Buy/Sell
Term of the Deal
Price
Pub Code

If you have any questions or you are no longer responsible for updating the 
origination schedule, please call me.

Thank you for your help.

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Dawn,

I can't believe it...I just saw Phillip Allen laugh!!!  Like laugh out loud!  
Shocking isn't it?  I don't know what caused this phenomenon but I thought 
you'd like to know about it.

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Robin

Hey,

I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that 
would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the 
blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were 
being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can 
probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I 
just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  

That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later,
Robin

I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard 
from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out 
of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no 
progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon.  
If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon.  
That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when 
I hear something.

I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.  It's the best family 
email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, 
wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and 
delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my 
brother's name on the gift.

I still haven't caught her.  Supposedly her meetings end at 5, so if I don't

Hey,

I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave 
him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him 
something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.  

Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of 
course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny 
that you wrote that to my from your work email.   

Well it's about time I got started working today.

Robin

Brian,

Frank forwarded you messaged about the error you were getting when trying to 
load adhoc var.  I can't help you with that issue, but you also mentioned you 
were having problems loading your spreadsheets.  I might be able to help you 
with that one.  Just give me a call.

Debbie,

Thank you for returning my call.  I went to the eRequest to submit a request 
for Risktrac but the only option was to get access to the application.  I 
already have the application I merely need access to the VAR module.  
Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.  Please let me know what I need to 
submit to ensure I get the proper access.

Thank you,
Robin

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

So all those West Virginia stereotypes are true after all!!!  I think all my 
family has their own teeth.  Even my grandparents have their own teeth.  You 
know I always thought I had good family stories, but you definitely outrank 
me there.  

Have a good weekend.

Subject: Teeth

Something else weird about my sister and her daughter ( the ones who live in 
the sticks in W.Va.).  They both had all of their teeth pulled and then got 
dentures.  Janey is 46 and Missy is 24 years old.  Isn't that icky?  Missy 
told me that she liked her dentures because her teeth no longer hurt!  And my 
sister, I hate to admit this, says she likes them because she can take them 
out and clean them every few days!  Dang!  If they had used good, or even 
fair, hygiene then they could still have their real teeth.  So, brush, brush, 
brush.
Now that you have picked yourself up off of the floor, stop laughing!
Do you have a family story to top this one?  Hope not.
Becky

I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here.

hey, not much here.  None of my bosses are here, however, Tim left me some 
work to do and I am having a hard time comparing my results to what the 
analysts say they should be.  Tim would be disappointed if this is not 
finished by tomorrow. At least that is what I think, so I am keeping myself 
busy.  I have time to check my e-mail though, so keep writing.   For example, 
you can lie to me about how beautiful Lake Charles is, oopsss.  I think Jeff 
enjoys harassing you very very much. 

Anyways, if you find something interesting to tell me, let me know.

It's unfortunate that the markets will be open right after Thanksgiving and 
Christmas but they will be (bidweek).  I need to know who will be around 
during those times to help keep the ship sailing.  Now, I will try to 
accomodate all requests for vacation time but I may not be able to let you

don't want to have Spanish, but.....  If we didn't have Spanish you and I

Jeff,

I took care of the Executive Viewer.  I talked to Frank and apparently 
Lavorato wants to see the Canadian breakout next week.  I already have 
everything set up to do the positions, but we need to work on Canada to get 
the P&L.  Intra-Canada has a breakout but it's only in Canadian dollars.  I 
left a message for Kathy to call me.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Talk to you Monday.
Robin

Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these 
books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as 
opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!

Most of the time we meet these deadlines.  Several days the P&L hasn't been 
exported by 7:20 b/c I was waiting for the Management p&l changes, so that 
there wouldn't be such large changes between our preliminary and final 
p&l's.  If you rather I didn't wait let me know.  There have been a couple of 
days I've just forgotten, but that's not a regular occurance.

Subject: timing of submitting information to Risk Controls

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

Anything interesting in your world?  

It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.  I may come

I remember when I was Looking for an apartment the locator always made a sale 
pitch on the fireplace. I always said I didn't care. This is the time  when 
you regret that, but anyways.   I first thought of just going to dinner, then 
I thought of maybe doing something else.  Now, I don't know anything.  Why 
do  you need to know if we do something else?   Do you worry you might go to 
bed a little late?   I do not want you to not get a good sleep just because 
of my birthday!!

I'll keep thinking. I will be here and probably will not go to my french 
class. I need to finish something and would rather skip french that be 
working here after class.

So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you 
just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you 
want to do something other than eat you need to let me know.  

We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have 
a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else.

Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these 
books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as 
opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!

Subject: Canadian VaR


I spoke with Bilal.  It is our understanding that the morning VaR report 
regarding Canada represents how we are capturing positions right now.  We are 
currently decomposing/reconstructing Disturnal's book to capture by region 
code (overall positions would remain the same).  This would impact Disturnal 
positions which will be moved to either McKay or Lambie.   From our side we 
are waiting on  the  IT resolution..  We have set a deadline of the last week 
in November to get this in motion.   On Monday, Bilal will give you a detail 
breakout of the deadline for Canada.

Regarding the the Canadian P&L report, I left a message for Gillis to get the 
numbers out there.

Additionally, last week we resolved the Canadian derived curve problem 
(derived curves were improperly mapped and position was not be captured....)  
We re-ran VaR and the e-mail below summarizes the breakout.  Overall, desk 
VaR decreased because Canadian VaR increased (hedges out portfilio).

Hope this gives you an idea of our progress.
Frank
PS. We will be moving Enovate out of Hunter Shively's VaR and give it is own 
place on the bench. This will probably impact the Central Desk VaR by approx. 
200K

I don't think most people would understand the humor, but I thought it was 
really funny.  Especially after the week I've had!!

Brian,

Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be 
the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the 
positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The 
positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our 
directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position.  
Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your 
positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR 
calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve 
this variance.  

Thanks,
Robin

The gas group stopped publishing it to the website, but I am not sure if they 
use the info for other purposes.  Maybe Robin or David can respond to that

Chris, most of the remaining people on the distribution list are EES

You can take Michael Benien and myself off of the list, as we no longer use 
this report.   Additionally, you should remove Rahmaan Mwongozi and Gabriel 
Monroy as they no longer work in the gas group.  You might want to check with 
the others to see if the report needs to continue going to them also.

 Virendra,

Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It 
is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily 
deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the 
current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that 
are fixed price gas daily deals.  

Thanks,
Robin

Hey,

Several of us are going to lunch today.  It's kind of a combination birthday 
party and going away party for Crystal.  Oops I shouldn't have told you she's 
coming...just kidding.  You're invited if you want to come.  But I understand 
if you are too busy today to take a long lunch.  Let me know if you want to 
come.

GOING????!!!  How about completely gone!  I've only been here an hour and a 
half and already we've had two major crisises!  Doesn't that sound like fun?  
Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You 
really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy 
a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her 
yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little 
anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a 
father's day gift for my dad.  

Well, have fun.  Talk to ya later.

I hate to complain but the lunch was greasy and the garlic in the fettuccini 
was crunchy and there was a ton of it.  Can you smell the garlic from there?  
At least the cheese cake was good.
I'm going crazy.

David,

Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  

1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the 
positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  

2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is 
overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  

3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of 
your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books 
your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This 
process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  

4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not 
designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.

4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do 
not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  

5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more 
books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  

6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends 
that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process 
must be started over.

7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time 
researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS 
position.

8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact 
the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours 
it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  

9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone 
with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently 
in the bench.  

10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and 
have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is 
lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen 
it. 

If you have any more questions let me know.

Robin

Susan,

The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, 
we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can 
capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same 
attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the 
AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set 
up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named 
M_Maggi.  

If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks,
Robin

Hey Becky,

What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need 
another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone 
else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The 
olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play 
Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we 
won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first 
week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I 
spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story 
for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, 
muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters 
one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 
80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people 
on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII 
veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was 
pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why 
they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the 
war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a 
lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when 
an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war.  
He said, "Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very 
well so I left."  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece 
where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in 
the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends 
bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of 
money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then 
they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that 
interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out 
with old people!!  

How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's 
all anyone's talking about around here.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Debbie,

I would like to have access to the VAR reports in RisktRac.  I am responsible 
for preparing the Gas Benchmark and the VAR report that is given to ENA 
management each morning.   Therefore I already have access to the VAR 
information.  Please let me know what I need to do to be granted this access.

Thank you,

I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these.  Actually the first one's kind 
of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the 
bottom.  

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal 
carcasses with cancers,
     tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for 
human consumption as
        long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a 
general loosening of
     slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends 
Aug. 29. One critic
    already weighed in, saying she did not want to "eat pus from a chicken 
that has pneumonia," but
    also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, 
infectious arthritis and diseases
                             caused by intestinal worms.



                               In Their Own Words

     Hubert Penrod Jr., on why the May promotion he had scheduled for his 
Huge Hooter Haven
     strip club in Nashville had failed to attract men who had come to town 
for the Billy Graham
    Crusade that weekend: "I know all the porn stars, but I don't exactly 
keep up with preachers.
     Hell, I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something. It never 
entered my mind that (it
                was) some preacher (who) was filling up the football stadium."

Thank goodness she's in when Congress will be a complete deadlock on every 
issue that is brought up!!  I really don't want  a government that can't even 
manage their money or make a decision in under a year deciding what doctor I 
can see.  It probably will reduce medical cost significantly.  People will 
just die before they can wade through the red tape to go to the doctor!!!

Later,
Robin

Wei,

I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open 
Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.   
Can you refresh the table to see if this position will pull into the 
Benchmark Agg_View table?  I am including the book id, post id, and position 
from yesterday.  Let me know if you need any more information.



BOOK ID   POST ID POSITION
INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  1062779 -477.7 contracts


Thanks,
Robin

Yeah, I'm still here.  Still trying to tie out the basis.  I'll let you 
know.  I'm beginning to think I'll just tell them I haven't accomplished 
anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted 
anyway...my PRC rep doesn't even know I'm a girl.  In the email he sent 
Gossett he kept saying summarize "his" accomplishments, and "his" strengths, 
etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious.

I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave.

These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate 
(scheduled) volumes for May.
The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel 
retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy 
price for the storage book.
The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule 
6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility 
balance, (4,295 mmbtu).

Thanks,
Kenny

Time spent actually typing, procrastinating, or staring blankly into space??  
I spent the most of the morning Wed. on evaluations.  Of course I had five to 
do and plenty of little tasks thrown in the middle.  So it probably took me 
about 20 minutes per evaluation.  Some I had to think about a little harder 
than others.  It all depends on how many comments you write.  Mine took me 
the longest and I'm still not happy with it.  

Have fun bowling.  I'd love to see your shirt!!

While waiting for the computer guy to fix my software connections I went

Python.  The high points of the snake included the comment that it has "never 
bitten" anyone and that it come with an exercise stick.   If you were a 
snake, would you bite someone with an exercise stick?  Sounds like a time 
bomb to me.The stupid snake also comes with a bed and a light!  Is that so it 
can read in bed?  Who cares about a stupid snake.  The things people try to 
sell.  FYI.  B

You really want to leave badly, don't you?  I don't think I have anything you 
can do though.  I packed when I went home for my nap, so as soon as I can get

then I should be ready to go.

Hey Becky,

I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from 
me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to 
Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my 
family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if 
there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas 
shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got 
to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a 
hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing 
really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be 
running marathons by now.  

I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right 
now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right 
now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this 
month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each 
day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one 
week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact 
I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this 
afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  

Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.  

Robin

I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down 
here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me 
nuts.  That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your 
other buddy, Chris Disable.  All we did was go in circles for about 45 
minutes.

How's your day going?

Kathy,

I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will 
be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your 
number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on 
the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with 
Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to 
remind him at the end of the month.

I start my new job in Chicago next week.  Bilal Bajwa will assume my 
responsibilities.  Here are everyone's numbers.


Bilal Bajwa x713-853-3409

P&L-  Bradley Jones  x713-345-8960

Positions- Binh Pham x713-853-5791

Thanks,
Robin

Nancy,

The OPTIONS-EXOTIC-PRC book should not have EXCELSHEETS as the database id.  
This post id is calced and officialized in ERMS.  The book administrator 
informed me that this post id contains only option premiums and does not 
contain positions.  

Hope that answers your questions.
Robin

Subject: DEC 29 '00 PostIDS

All:

Can you please review the attached and provide assistance in resolving.  We 
are trying to resolve why these postids did not get captured by  RisktRAC for 
Dec 29, 2000                   




1) For the Gas-Chase9 books does anyone know when the database ID was changed 
to ERMS OLD? Are these accrual books?

2)  Does anyone know why the Options-Exotic-PRC  book has a database id of 
EXCELSHEETS?  Is the book uploaded as a spreadsheet or is it suppose to feed 
from RisktRAC?

3) For the FT-EAST-BAS book, which is the correct postid?

4) For the Weather book does anyone know why the PostID was not 
officialized?  Does it need to be officialized?

Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.  They are in the 
process of tying out the Annual report and need to resolve these issues.



Regards,



Nancy

Maybe if you had done more to relieve my boredom yesterday I would have been 
more willing to drive you back downtown.  I'm glad you made it back somewhat

Tom,

It looks like everything ran perfectly.  I have attached a copy of the 
positions that were loaded into the system.  Let me know if you see any 
problems, but they seem to be in line with what you expected.  

Let me know if you have any questions.
Robin

Good morning,

Here is last night's benchmark report which includes our latest intramonth 
deals.  I also made the changes you suggested.  You should see MTM of around 
(79,000) and a volumetric position of approximately (600,000) for the 
intramonth deals.

Please test the file at your first convenience.

Thanks,

Tom

How did you start your accomplishments?  About the only thing I'm coming up 
with is "Once upon a time I didn't work in risk and I had a life."  There's 
probably a better way to do it though.

Good morning.  How's your day going?  Mines pretty good...no screaming yet.  
But then there's still plenty of hours left in this day.  Could you send the 
the procedures you wrote for this job.  Don't you think it's about time I 
figured out what I was supposed to be doing?  

Thanks,

Nancy,

The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
used.

If you have any more questions, give me a call.
Robin

Robin:

Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
follows



	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST

In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
were also changed as follows:


	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1

These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.


If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751


Nancy

As an update on Canada, I replied to Kathy's email and told her we weren't 
going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.  I 
told him they wouldn't listen to me and his comment was "They'll listen to 
Sally."  Hehehe.  We'll see, but I'm not convinced that Canada will listen to 
anyone.

Thank you, it worked
 MS DOS definitely does not work for me anymore. It is weird because it works 
when I send myself a message. Try sending yourself a message to see what 
happens. Let me know. 

Have you kept up with any new information about Risk people? You know what I

I would like to change my parking contract from the Clay garage to the Allen

Precisely the problem...I haven't been getting that file.  I finally just 
built an EES report in the Basis report.

Thanks for sending it,

Here's all my trip information.  Do I need to highlight how long the flight 
is so you'll know when to come pick me up??  How's your day going?  Mine's 
really quiet.  In fact everything went so smoothly this morning that it made 
me nervous.

Are you watching this eSpeak?  Either no one is asking interesting questions 
or they are censoring them.  I asked about why we have arbitrarily assigned 
PRC reps, but she hasn't answered that yet.

You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a 
year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I 
must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as 
they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited 
to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c 
anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm 
actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One 
of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it 
should be a nice 20 hour day today. 

I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need 
something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can 
find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm 
tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and 
give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  

Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that 
has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty 
funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  

Enjoy a doughnut for me.
Robin

Gas prices are so high that when I pulled into a station this morning and
asked for a dollar's worth, the attendant dabbed some behind my ears.

I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 
11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have 
one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it 
tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by 
tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!  So it's not safe to ride with me 
yet.  Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage!  

I'm glad you'll be getting out of here early.  

Robin

Subject: [1_Bakery_Madness] A CHANGE IN PLANS


Couldn't resist sending this!!!!!!!!!!! Sandy
Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this

A CHANGE IN PLANS

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will
get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you
wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made
regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember
that
most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey
was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's
recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should
mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal
drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore
them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also
decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,
please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of
harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate
room. Next door.

Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front
of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our
dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress "private" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the
kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on
my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to
reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.

Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional
pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will
still have a choice: take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either.

I am thankful.

Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke.  
Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new 
guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call 
and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving 
that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff 
he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have 
to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy 
hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent 
him an email with the flight information.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch?

Kathy,

The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated 
in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually 
made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and 
origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting.

Robin

Robin,
$4.1 M was to have been reduced from our Q1 trading income to break out the 
origination correctly.  It looks like this was never done in your report.  I 
thought it had been based on previous Emails.  I don't think the p&l in your 
report is correct as it is $4.1M too high.  This is what our trading income 
at Dec 31 should be.  Note:  the DPR was never adjusted because the LTD and 
YTD numbers do not exclude orgination income.  It also looks like the break 
out by trader is not quite right

Kathy

Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.


 

Thanks,
Robin

Okay, here's a trivia question for you.   There are two siblings.  One's an 
engineer and one's an accountant.  One works for a natural gas company and 
the other works for an accounting firm.  Which one works for the accounting 
firm?  

Do you see the absurdity of our lives???  Level III, huh?  I don't know 
anyone over level II.  Well, except Mr. Kirkpatrick's friend that's a partner 
in New Orleans.  

I dreamed the other night that I was outside the Swimming venue in Australia 
and the American coach heard me talking and realized I was an American.  He 
told me I had to swim an event b/c all the swimmers were either sick or 
injured.  I never did get to swim, though.  The alarm went off before I even 
found out what event I was swimming.  I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't 
be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.  Not that I'd even be 
competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the 
special olympics...then I might stand a chance!

Congrats on the job.  
Robin

We actually got some significant rain...up to 8 inches in some areas. Of 
course there was none at the airport, so officially it didn't rain yesterday. 
I was in FortWorth while it was raining here, so all I got was the spray from 
the wet roads making my car dirty.

When do you leave for Australia. Bring me back something nice.

I'll be an Experienced Consultant Level III in the Supply Chain service line 
with Arthur Andersen. It sounds like a really fun job, and they made an offer 
I can't turn down.

>>> <Robin.Rodrigue@enron.com> 9/12/2000 3:33:27 PM >>>

Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain
here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make
my car look like I went driving through mud puddles.

What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I
enjoy the fact that this is on your company email.

I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and
dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I
don't think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have
two right now.

Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But 
then I'm sure I'm prejudice.  

Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday.

These books to be added to AGG-GASIV, AGG-GASIII and Canada

Kathy,

I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more 
guidelines for the text files.  

1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every 
day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then 
IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)

2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.

3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.

4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a 
zero.  

5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no 
dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have 
them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest 
of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take 
me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last 
crack b/c if I didn't you would have!

Chris,

The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on 
the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today.  
However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book 
administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination 
category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that 
file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Robin

No I did not send the postid's Robin and Rahmann.  I did not realize I needed 
to do this every night.  We can send you our postid sheet everynight if this 
is 
what you need.  When can we expect to get these books off the list?  I keep 
offocializing but they keep showing up on the list.  The physical books may 
not be showing up 
because, as per a previous memo from you, the book names are actually 
INTRA-MONTH-CANADA, and then there are desks are CAN-WEST, CAN-BC and

the following Canada intramonth books were on our unoofficialized list this

for Basis books the related Prc book did receive a post ID.  Were the post 
ids for the PRC books sent to Robin and  Roc so that they could override the 
basis information with the post ids?  Please advise as soon as possible.  I 
will be in class today, but please communicate with Burton regarding the

What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little 
stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend 
coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. 
afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range 
around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to 
rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies.  

As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the 
Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call 
Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I 
might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't 
know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do.  
Thanks for the help with this.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Well, We can go different routes. Do you know Brian Hoskins?  If not, I know 
him well. Well, he works in that group. He can tell us what it is about. The 
last time I talked to him, he did mention something about customers (big 
customers); but honestly I am not sure exactly what it is. Then what we can 
do is ask Ibrahim the name of his friend. We'll ask Brian if he knows him ( 
Brian, by the way, loves to help people. but only good people : ( 
 and we can go from there. 

If not, we can just go trhough Ibrahim. Once that is done, We'll figure what 
to tell Gossett (ouchhhh) . Uppsss, I do not want any oart during this stage. 
He will probably kill me if he knows I told you about this group.

Ibrahim is leaving next week. He had told me that he was going to stay about 
3 more weeks, but his new group wants him. Uppsss  I feel I have SOOOOO Much 
to learn. I really feel behind. There will be a lot of reading this weekend 
but of course I might take a break and go to the drive range if you want to 
go. You never responded me. Ok, ok, maybe you do not want to go. I'll go on 
my own and hit the ball with my tennis raquet.

Anyways. who said there was no stress level here. I am getting kind of 
nervous because it is a little complicated.  Tell me what you think.

Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis 
positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post 
id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the 
same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.

read what I wrote and "correct" things that are wrong...

Thanks,

Debbie,


I spoke with Robin and she confirmed that:
One post id for both price and basis books
She overrides the price book

The reason is that Risktrac needs unique book id/post id combo's.  However, 
the price book comes in no matter what, so she overrides the price book in 
order to pull in the basis book...She added that she also did not understand 
why they use one post id..

Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to 
live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They 
screwed their position up again today.  

My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the 
rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon 
and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some 
friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of 
Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type 
that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He 
was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a 
message on it that said, "Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't 
available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you."  

Are we having Spanish class today?  

Robin

PS My forearms are a little sore, but that's all.

  Rest of Saturday was good I went out with some friends to this place I

So, that was almost like going to Austin, plus on the way back rain was very 
very bad (The 10:30 pm. rain).  For the second time, Alejandra's plane was 
delayed, but this time it was more than 5 hours delayed. She got stuck in 
Dallas and of course I knew once I was already at IAH.  How about you? 
Hey, My right shoulder is a little sore (Golf). Is your's sore? or am I just 
a little rusty.

Sorry to hear you're having a bad day.  If it helps mine's not much better.  
I've been harrassed by at least half the company, I think.  Frank's out of 
the office, so I've got Sunil's replacement (who doesn't have a clue) calling 
me every two minutes, as well as Vlady calling, and the out of Control group 
calling, and Canada calling trying to get their p&l right......it's been 
nuts.  I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.  I 
would love to get out of the building for a little while.  Some lady just 
asked me for directions to get off this floor...  Does this seem scary to 
you??  Especially when you consider she was facing the neon EXIT sign down 
the hall.  Wow!!  Apparently everyone's lost their mind today.  

Hope your day gets better.
Robin

No not the HR Spy.  I was in the middle of emailing you when Jennifer walked 
up to chit chat.  I didn't even think about it and left my email up the whole 
time she was here.  But I went back and read it and I hadn't written anything 
incriminating yet.

How scandulous of your mother!!  My mother would never use sucks...but my dad 
told me something pissed him off one time.  I was completely shocked...I 
didn't even know what to say.  I know it's hard to imagine me speechless, but 
I was.  

You should know by now that I'm heartless and that my grandmother will have 
to go the hospital all alone.  I had to listen to her last time whine about 
how no one respects her.  It took everything I had not to say, "Of course we 
don't respect you.  We all know you're crazy."  

What are you doing for lunch Friday (as in probably the day you're reading 
this)?  I'm going to come in early b/c I've been bombarded as soon as I walk 
in the door the last two days.  

Let me know if you want to go to lunch.  I'll call you when I get in.  

I'll be praying for Megan.

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,
Robin

Notary accomplished.  Now I can drop this off on my way to get my oil

Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I 
had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling 
different factors.  

Let me know how the position looks tonight.

Jon,

Attached you will find a copy of the basis positions as reported to John 
Lavorato for November 17.  The positions listed represent the entire Canadian 
office position at each point.  The attached includes only those points that 
John Lavorato has requested be reported by trader, not every point at which 
you have positions.




If you have any questions please let me know.

Several books were set up in Risktrac will incorrect names.  Is it possible 
to simply change the names of the books already set up or do we need to have

So, I take it your having a bad day.  Don't let him stress you out.  Is there 
anything I can do to help?  I'm headed downstairs to buy stamps later.   Let 
me know if you want anything from downstairs.  

No one's asked the questions I was expecting.  I think Anne was too drunk to 
remember asking.  I'm sure it'll come back up eventually.  

Are you still planning to go work out at lunch?

Hope everything gets better.

I paid about $94 Austalian which is around $50.  It was a pretty big, and 
definitely awkward (that word doesn't look right) that's why it flew home on 
it's own.  Besides I already had my luggage allotment.  My box wasn't nearly 
as heavy as yours is.  What kind of tree did you buy???  What is it an iron 
statue of a tree?  

Are you leaving tomorrow?  I know I've asked you this before but I can't 
remember.  If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch.

Thanks,  I'll send this to Ibrahim and he will then send that to the guy in 
EBS.  I have a few  questions for you.  How much did you pay for the box that 
was sent to you from Australia?  Why did you not take it with you? 

Ok, this is the story. My mom asked me if I could buy a Christmas tree,and of 
course, being a super duper nice son as I am, I was stupid enough to buy it. 
Well the box is about 63 lbs. and 57 x 14 inches . I called Continental and 
they said they would accept it.  Well, I am not sure about the whole thing. 
First, it is so big that it doesn't even fit in my car. I had to take it home 
with the trunk open. I'll see how I can figure this out, but I just wanted to 
ask you about the box from Australia. 

Anyways, I hope I can see you before I leave for Mexico. I probably just drop 
by and say bye. Of course I have not packed and still have to buy a few 
things. Have a nice day. I'll let you know about the whole EBS thing.

It sounds pretty good, but I'd rather talk to mom and see if there's 
something specific he wants before we get that.  B/c for all his talk about 
using the computer he usually ends up using his books instead.  

I'll call mom either tonight or in the morning.  I'll let you know what I 
find out.

Subject: Differences in Portfolio!

I compared the different portfolios in RisktRac and came up with the 
following changes. Hopefully this would help eliminate some of the 
differences amongst the different portfolios ....

FT-Peoples needs to be removed from P Keavey - Currently it is being double 
counted in P Keavey and J Williams.

The following books to be added to AGG-GASII
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-BAS 
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-PRC 
FT-HPLC-BAS 
FT-HPLC-PRC
FT-INT-CEN-MKT-GDL


These books to be added to AGG-GASIV, AGG-GASIII and Canada
FT-US/CAND-ERMS-GDL (Under J_McKay - Robin please confirm)


Please let me know if you have any other suggestions/comments to help solve 
this problem as soon as possible.

Bilal

Gary/Susan,

We need to set up a new Intra-Central Physical Book.

INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY

There are already Intra-Cnt-Trans Price, Basis, GD, and IDX books set up.  
The region code for the physical book should be CENTRLTRSP.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin

Frank, 

I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those 
days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of 
the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 
31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once 
Feb rolles to intramonth the "From date" on the calc is changed from the Jan 
1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect 
on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly 
captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR 
calc not the post ids.  

Let me know if this doesn't answer your question. 
Robin

Wei,
I appreciate your help. If I hear you right, it appears it may have to do 
with the way post id's and books are officialized.  Thanks for your help.

Robin,
For whatever reason, we didn't pick up VaR for Feb intra-month on Jan 31, and 
on Feb 1, a lot of intra month hit.  I've been investigating, with Bharat, 
and RAC initially thought it had something to do with the code and that GRMS 
didn't roll in physical until the first of the month (I guess).  Now it seems 
like it may have something to do with the way Post id's/books are 
officialized. (I guess).  Please give this a looksy and let me know.

Nilay,
Thanks for your help, any ideas on why would be helpful.

Let me/Bharat know if we should bring ERMS into the picture.

Thanks,
Frank

Bharat,

First I checked VaR number for this portfolio_id since 26-JAN-01.  Notice 
there was consecutive VaR jump from 26-JAN-01 to 1-FEB-01.

PORTFOLIO_ID    EFF_DT        DOWN95       UP95
--------------- --------- ---------- ----------
INTRA-WEST-PH1  26-JAN-01 -534098.14  468809.11
INTRA-WEST-PH1  29-JAN-01 -2472601.4 2351240.92
INTRA-WEST-PH1  30-JAN-01 -4860067.9 4509638.58

INTRA-WEST-PH1  02-FEB-01 -6328870.8  6454349.9
INTRA-WEST-PH1  05-FEB-01 -5535044.3 5546160.24

Then I checked sum of delta_position and gamma for book_id INTRA-WEST-PHY on 
those dates.  Since I notice that VaR had a big jump from 26-JAN-01 to 
29-JAN-01, so I also group by reference data on those two dates.

  1  select ref_dt, strip_flag, sum(delta_position), sum(gamma)
  2  from rms_open_position
  3  where eff_dt = '&1'
  4  and book_id = 'INTRA-WEST-PHY'
  5  and nvl(strip_flag, 0) >= 0
  6  group by ref_dt, strip_flag
  7* having (sum(delta_position) > 0 or sum(gamma) > 0)

The following is the list of sum of delta position on those dates without 
group by reference_dt:

31-JAN-01 to 28-FEB-01)
   30-JAN-01          3          8901557.37          0 (Reference date 
01-FEB-01 to 28-FEB-01)
   31-JAN-01          3          9539555.15          0 (Reference date 
02-FEB-01 to 28-FEB-01)
   01-FEB-01          3          8782018.97          0 (Reference date 
01-FEB-01 to 28-FEB-01)
   02-FEB-01          3          7889069.32          0 (Reference date 
06-FEB-01 to 28-FEB-01)
   05-FEB-01          3          7597454.74          0 (Reference date 
07-FEB-01 to 28-FEB-01)

It looks to me the trend on VaR change is very similar to the trend on delta 
position change.  If you want to know why delta position went higher from 
26-JAN-01 to 01-FEB-01, we need to get ERMS people involved.  RisktRAC 
basically just pulls position from ERMS.

Thanks,

Wei

added to the AGG-GAS III or AGG-GAS IV portfolios.  Please add these books 
under the J_Mrha porfolio in AGG-GAS III and AGG-GAS IV.

That's scary.  It's probably just as well I couldn't open it...I wouldn't

Subject: Enron ends exclusive agreement with Blockbuster

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress.

Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they 
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and 
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the 
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled 
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they 
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to 
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian "logic."

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an 
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the 
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted 
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if 
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her 
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian 
p&l and for the originations total.  

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country 
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT 
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

I'll whine more later,
Robin

Hey, are going to Jeff Skilling's Analyst kick off ?   How's your day? Mine

I definitely want them.  We had several questions last month about why some 
curves where included where they were.  So it'd be nice to be able to blame 
someone else!  How's your day going?  How long did it take you to get up the 
elevator?  I made it in before the crowd backed up.  But apparently one of 
the elevators got stuck.  You know Dave Delainey's admin, Beverely.  She said 
she was stuck in the elevator for about 45 minutes this morning!!  She didn't 
seem too excited about it either.

Subject: Curves

Hey,  I have the original list of physical curves for the basis report that 
we divided up in  East, West, Central and Canada.  Remeber? It is the one 
that Gossett helped us divide into all these regions.  I also have the one 
where all the desk leads wrote their physical curves on.  If you want them 
I'll keep them, if not, they will be autodestroyed in 5 seconds.

Brad,

Here is the book that was set up for John Arnold's crude position.  The

you require additional information please do not hesitate to call.

Thanks,

Nancy,

I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the 
Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS 
for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied 
to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.

BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE

INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST

IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter 
as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently 
used region code.)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help,
Robin

Nancy,

The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
used.

If you have any more questions, give me a call.

Robin:

Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
follows



	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST

In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
were also changed as follows:


	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1

These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.


If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751


Nancy

Actually I already have plans with the "girls" from Accounting.  I think 
we're going to Lupe's.  You are invited if you want to come.  But give me a 
definite yes or no...none of this "I'd like to" crap.  

We're going to leave at 11:30.

When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid 
harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have 
nothing else to do I might as well go.

Hey Lynn,

Is Laura back in the office?  I was hoping we could start working with HR 
early this week, so there would be a possibility that we would have a 
decision made by the end of the week.

Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene 
what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, 
if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any 
legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers 
that.  

I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had 
better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her 
about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good.  

Do you have lunch plans?

I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight!  But I'm also bringing a good 
book, and I'll probably bring a pair of headphones...even if I don't plug 
them into anything.  I think I'll have them as a decoy in case I end up with 
an annoying neighbor for the flight.  Everyone around me knows my travel 
plans as well as I do.  I think I must have become a little annoying myself.  

Well back to work.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging 
out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I 
don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today.  

Hope you're having a good day.

A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive
   cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month,
   having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made
   even
   his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against
   the
   insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were
   lost
   "in a series of small fires".
   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that
   the
   man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and
   won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated,
   nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which

   it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that

   it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be
   considered to be an "unacceptable fire," and was obligated to pay the
   claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the
   insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the
   rare cigars he had lost in the "fires".
   And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance
   company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance
   claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the
   man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and
   sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.

At that rate you will pay to get out of Houston right?     No worries, there 
is still another game on the 20th and the Season begins Feb 27th (this one is 
for points. The other two are Pre-season but still very competitive because 
they are organized by the league).  By the 27th, maybe you will already have 
finished GMAT. 

So, I guess I should not even worry about having told Purvi right?    Well, 
if you finish the benchmark early, you know where to go, but don't worry. I 
won't be expecting you. Let me know what you hear from Laura (if that is how 
you spell her name).  I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess. I'll let you 
know what the outcome was. 
There is absolutely nothing to do. I am educating myself by reading some 
things about Acquisitions.

I thought you  comments about the "flexibility" of the program were 
hilarious.  I just talked to Laura.   I'm moving to Chicago.  I'll give you

I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a 
July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the 
same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are 
not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that 
had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  

BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)

GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9

GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3

GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)

If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic 
please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin

All I know is no one is here to answer my questions and they are all in the 
same PRC meeting.  I don't know if it's just the leads or if it's an HR

Interesting though isn't it?

What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my 
accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues 
with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments 
tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start 
until 8:45 right?

Yeah, I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do! Just 
kididng.  I just completely forgot about it this weekend.  I meant to drop it 
off Sat. and then us go shopping.  Oh well.  If I don't get to it I'll have 
it done as soon as I get to Lake Charles.  The other stuff shouldn't take 
that long.  It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it.  

Call me when you get out of French.  I'll probably still be packing, so you 
can stop by and visit.

  Hi Robin,

  Congratulations on signing up for the best test prep course
  available! As part of your course, you get enhanced access to
  The Princeton Review's award-winning web site. Below is some
  important  information to help you use these services. Be sure
  to save this email for future reference.

  NEW TO THE WEB?
  ---------------
  If you are not too familiar with using the Web, you should
  check  out "Web 101" at the HotWired site. It's a great
  resource that'll answer just about every question you could
  have about the Web. You can find it at:

        http://www.hotwired.com/web101

  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  -------------------
  To use all of the features on the website, you'll need the
  following:

  SAT and GMAT students:

   Web Browser:
 ------------
 PC Users will need Internet Explorer version 5.0 and above
 or Netscape Navigator 4.7 or above.
 MAC Users will need Netscape 4.7 or above.
 JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this.

 Finally, you=01,ll need a Flash and Acrobat enabled browser.  If
 you do not have these, you need not worry.  Simply click on the
 Requirements Check link after Logging In and clicking on the
 same link off of the Getting Started Page.  The Online check
 will allow you to download all necessary plug-ins.

 Modem:
 ------
 56 kbps or faster

  Students preparing for all other tests:

 Web Browser:
 ------------
   Netscape Navigator 4.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 4.0 or
   higher. JavaScript and Cookies must both be enabled. This is
   the default setting on both browsers so if you haven't changed
   anything, you don't need to worry about this. For best
   results, we recommend using Netscape. If you need to download
   a new web browser, you can do so at the following address:

         http://www.netscape.com/download/

   Modem:
 ------
   28.8 kbps or faster

  LOGGING IN
  -----------
  Whenever you go to the Princeton Review website
  http://www.princetonreview.com, you should click on the "Course
  Students Click Here" button that appears at the top of each
  page. To enable your course services, simply enter your
  username and password in the appropriate fields on the page.
  For your records, here are the username and password you
  selected when you registered:

       USERNAME: robin.rodrigue@enron.com
       PASSWORD: 7@hzq*hq

  LOGGING OUT
  -----------
  If you are using a public computer, like one in a library or
  dorm, it's a very good idea to log out when you finish your
  work on the website. All you have to do is click on the "Log
  Out" link that appears on every page after you log in.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  -----------------------------
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
"real"
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  ------------------

So what you're telling me is that you're intentionally trying to bait me.  
Apparently you haven't figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your 
health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last 
statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You're going to spend the 
rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don't deny it.  I know you too well.  
So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little 
better I'd be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I'll just leave it at 
this...the US could kick Mexico's butt at anything!!  Mexican men can't even 
knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to 
try!!  How could you possibly expect a group of these weaklings to beat a 
group of top quality American athletes.

Bye.

PS Have fun in all those meetings.  Pretty soon you'll be going to more than 
Gossett.

Oohhh that one, it was cancelled.  I am becoming more bureaucratic now, so I 
had a meeting at 10:00 with Treasury, then I was supposed to have this one at 
1:00 and there is another one with Corporate Finance at 2:30.  To tell you 
the truth, the one at 10:00 I was clueless and then I found out I was the one 
that was supposed to kind of give all the information. (information I of 
course did not know). It was a good learning experience because we called 
somebody else that I told them had the information.   

Thanks for asking.  I am getting ready and pumped up because I think today at 
6:30 we are going to kick some gringo butt.  What do you think?  You need to 
get upset, because otherwise this is not going to be fun.

I wasn't worried about you making it.  I was worrried about you making it 
back in time to give me my presents.  I work with a guy in our Chicago 
office.  He said it was pretty bad there.  I told him you were headed up 
there and he said he hoped you didn't mind delays.  Glad you made it safely.  

You know you can buy disposable cameras at most stores.

What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on 
Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for 
overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I 
can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of 
shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit 
these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it 
felt like.  

Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with 
how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always 
asking and driving you crazy.  

Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.

Some one butchered Carla's hair.  Poor thing.  I think I'd go to another hair

Megan's getting an MRI this morning.  
I need another day off because I worked so much Thursday, Friday and Sunday!  
And food is not payment!

Gabriel,

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.  

Thanks,
Robin

Subject: Origination Problem

Robin,
I spoke with Kathy regarding the problem we are having with origination. Her 
explanation is as follows:
This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) 
which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense 
will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses 
on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate 
and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination.  
Therefore, the total origination as per the "origination" tab will NOT equal 
the origination as per the "report" tab. Robin should add in the translation 
gains/losses to get it to reconcile. 
I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to 
the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our 
origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never 
again be the same.
Please call if you have any questions,
Nicole

Hey guys,

Here are your positions for tonight.  We are off on FT CAN, but remember I 
included the Exotics text file in that position.  I am also attaching IM 
Canada.  

Please let me know how it looks as soon as possible so we can resolve 
variances before the system is shut down.

The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today.  
When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not 
divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John 
Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included 
in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin

So are you thinking going to dinner or something else?  I need to know if you 
just can decide on a resturant or you can decide on what to do?  And if you 
want to do something other than eat you need to let me know.  

We could just curl up in front of the fireplace...oh wait neither of us have 
a fireplace.  Guess we'll have to think of something else.

I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this 
morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably 
needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's 
just no pleasing some people.  

I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no 
sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH.  
Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.

I'll give you a birthday call later.
Robin

Don't you think that you are going to get away with just leaving a message.  
I am waiting for a more personal Happy Birthday call. 

Thanks anyways. 

What time did you get out of here yesterday?

Gabriel

Unfortunately I'm afraid that your last estimate is probably the most 
realistic.  Today is my favorite day of the month...we're rolling everything 
today!!!  Let me  rephrase that I'M rolling everything tonight.  Maybe that 
way I won't have to reroll it in the morning!!

Kathy,

Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it 
looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't 
send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel 
file that Brian saved in the directory.

Thanks,
Robin

Sorry it took me so long to reply, we had a slight crisis here.  I went to 
Shreveport on Nov. 2.  That would be about right for when you left b/c you 
left me just in time to have to roll the month by myself...just kidding.

She does seem pretty impressed that she's effectively the first person we've

I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit 
looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today?  
So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and 
their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A 
manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the 
analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for 
him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his 
desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 
30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to 
come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 
7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, "Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't 
work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any 
questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further."  Funny, I 
didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I 
had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been 
nice to chew someone out.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Nicole,

This is the position EXCLUDING Exotics.  I haven't been able to load the text 
file yet.  But I'll send that as soon as I have it.  I also included the

Let me know if I can help.

My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake 
this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John 
called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 
million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are 
calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was 
something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  

That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to 
actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that 
has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might 
call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake.  
You'll be invited too of course.  

I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?

Talk to ya later

No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should 
be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent 
three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible.  
They just keep saying the same things over and over.  

What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?  At the rate we're 
going I'm never going home.  No one is finished yet.  Talk to ya later.

did not have Spanish. Even though I am not busy we were kind of determined to 
finish fixing the model. We are tired of it.  I am also tired of looking at 
it. Did you start watching Defensive Driving?

Yeah,my family's pretty entertaining!!  I went home last weekend for my mom's 
birthday.  We had all gone somewhere and when we were about to turn the 
corner on our street we were all praying and holding our breath hoping my 
grandmother wasn't at our house!!  She's been driving my mother crazy (it's 
my dad's mom by the way).  She's now determined that there's something 
terribly wrong with her.  She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's 
going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.  My 
dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she 
actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and 
forth to the dr.   She's wrong of course!  

Well enough rambling for now.  If I get any good family emails I'll let you 
know!

You must be having a bad day!!  But you know it's not my fault...and there's 
nothing soft about softball!!  And I slid yesterday, twice, so I have a 
little bit of a rasberry on my calf.  Did that get me any sympathy??  
Probably not!  I hope you finish close soon.

Sorry to hear you're being hazed today.  I'm glad to know he thinks you are 
worth something.  You can be pretty certain I won't be coming to join your 
new group when I rotate.  I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group 
so I don't have to do anything.

Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the 
fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited 
today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today 
off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift 
day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December 
calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the 
first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited.  

Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today?

Bye-bye.

I am glad everything is fine on your side.  I am sorry you did not get much 
sleep.  It is a mistery why sometimes you have those nights where you wake up 
looking at the clock. I am sure your problem was due to your  excitement to 
come back to work. You could not wait any longer. Well, I am definitely not 
glad... the hazing started again, and I think it doubled.  If we look at it 
in an optimistic way, having me do these exercises that are really hard mean 
his expectations have not been lowered.  He still thinks I am worth 
something. 

Talk to you later. I am being subdued right now.

with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get 
much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to 
bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and 
look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other

And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?

Hi!
How is it possible that my Financial Statement Analysis book was more helpful 
than your Tax book as far as how to handle NOL accounts?
It was not even worth carrying that heavy book. Just kidding, thank you very 
much anyways.  Was everything ok this morning?

I felt bad I left really late last night. I hope you got some good rest. 
Glad you are back at work?

Kathy,

Here is the detail and position for IM Canada yesterday.  It seems that the 
price txt file didn't get run last night (our fault).   I'll make sure that 
gets done tonight.

Let me know if you need anything else.

I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my 
parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right 
there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and 
stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my 
complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have 
the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much 
money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I 
don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes.  
I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over 
there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's 
and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own.  

I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all 
the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know.   
And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers.

We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours.  

Talk to ya later,
RR

Kathy,

I just spoke with Gary Stadler and he said the number doesn't really matter 
for our purposes but it must be unique for the system.  He suggested you just 
make it a consecutive numbering down the file.

It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the 
weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and 
a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a 
lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  

I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So 
just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or 
in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Jeff Gossett has indicated to me that you are the person responsible for the 
Benchmark and NGP&L cost center (cc107074). I left you a voice mail 
indicating that I would send you a copy of energy operation's activities.  We 
are still in a phase-in process where we are trying to make this process as 
efficient and easy for you as possible. 

For now, if you could:
Identify the activities being performed by your team (cc107074), and the 
hours worked during the month of October
Identify drivers for your activities. This would be things that affect your 
workload, for example, in RM Texas the driver is # of deals; please call me 
if you need further clarification
Identify the commercial teams that you guys support



Our goal is to have this information by Wednesday, Nov. 8, if this is going 
to be a problem, please let us know.  Next month, you will be able to access 
cc107074 through the normal survey, which is through MS Access.

Please call either myself, x3-597, or Shari Mao for further information.

Thanks,
Jen Reside

You crack me up...I think I only know one person who has worse luck at work 
than you do, and that would be my EMT friend that broke someone's glass eye.  
I can't believe your boss is making you work on Monday...even we don't have 
to work Monday.  

I'll talk to ya later,

Oohhh that is fine. Not a problem.  I love biiiiigggg breakfasts in NIICE 
restaurants. 

What is up with me in this group. They are definitely going to fire me. We 
were in a conference call with  the CEO of the Transportation company. His 
counselors, his tax lawyer, his investment bank, my boss, our counselor, our 
tax expert, and other very important people. Actually the conference was very 
very interesting. We (they, I just listened)basically talked about what to do 
with the unvested options of all the employees from the transport company, we 
talked about how the deal was going to change from a Stock purchase to a 
Merger. We talked about tax strategies, etc. It was very interesting.  HERE 
is the funny part. When we were discussing about all these things, I decided 
to stretch my leg  and guess what? "I unplugged the phone line".  Yeahh we 
missed some of the conversation.   My boss was like "ohhh sh.....".  I 
thought it was funny, but obviously he did not think so. 

Oohhh you know what. I actually work Monday. My boss decided to veto our 
holiday Monday.   I am going to come in just to sort out all the due 
dilligence paperwork. It will be for a couple of hours only. YOu can take my 
car, and when the car is ready, you can probably pick me up and we'll go and 
pick it up.   

Gabriel

Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last 
year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  

I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange.  
Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my 
accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I 
could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my 
accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated 
every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and 
positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.

See you at lunch.

I have a question. Do you think it is possible to RSVP for the X-mas Party - 
you and your invitee- then your invitee shows up without you? Do you think 
they'll let him/her get in?

I'll explain what I am trying to do at lunch or Brown Bag.

the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they 
were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge 
$6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an 
entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of

1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.

2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to 
properly represent originations on the NGP&L.

3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.

4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by 
consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so 
that the information                need only be queried once.  This was 
accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  

5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total 
and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.

6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that 
have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report 
to the Benchmark.

7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the 
fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price 
position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  

I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would 
like to see them also please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin

I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I 
thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been 
much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in 
Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this 
floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm 
just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her.  

Talk to ya later.

Kathy,

I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position.  
Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to 
find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato 
requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other 
traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are 
not shown on this report.  

Brian,

I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let 
me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report 
containing December 12th basis positions.  

Thank you for your help.
Robin

Robin,
I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do 
Disturnal, Lambie & McKay



I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the 
following:
1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the 
spreadsheet.
2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not 
being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this 
month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be 
picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For 
example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM 
traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco 
prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek).

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field 
yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should 
pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her "I've been here 
longer, so you can work Valentines night."  The only thing that makes me feel 
bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a 
while.  

Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute

I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though.

Thursday.  Yippee!!  This is my last bidweek...Thank goodness.

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,
Robin

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my 
time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it 
again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through 
that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch.  
If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  

Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up 
for whatever you want to do (within reason that is). 

Gotta go Canada's calling.

Guess what I found out this morning.   It looks like I'll be rotating out of 
this job just in time.  Jeff said Louise Kitchen is just like Shankman.  
Yikes...  We've (Jeff and I) not to tell Binh anything about her.  Lavo 
stresses her out, so I don't think she'd take the job if she knows it's only 
going to get worse!!

I told you about this Friday...you were probably just not awake enough to

Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your 
email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive 
chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the "fun run" on 
Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were 
here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate 
how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how 
Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out 
the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that 
he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.

As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.  
I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They 
have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though 
was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I 
guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a 
vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of 
lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat 
meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to 
the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little 
too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in 
seasoning.  

I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course 
going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But 
then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the 
speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be 
worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear 
under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the 
beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure 
he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might 
see and for fear he'd think I was interested.

Gotta go to a meeting.
Robin

Wow, what a trip.  Wish I could have been there to be with all those old
people.  I do have specific questions about Australia though.
How is the food?  Weird, good or just not worth eating?  What do they eat?
What did you eat?
See any good looking guys?
Did you make them speak just to hear the accent?  Did they make you speak
just to hear your accent?
Going back?
Megan enjoyed your email  message.  Needless to say so did I.
Ann and I ran a 25 K (15.5 miles) yesterday morning.  Got a T-shirt and a
banana for the run.  Neat, huh?  I was nine minutes slower this year than
last year but it doesn't bother me.  I had fun but at about mile 13 I was
definitely ready to cross the finish line.  I just had a couple more miles.
 My shorts chaffed the inside of my inner thighs and that was/is painful.
Is that too much information?  I can walk this morning but my legs are
fatigued.  I couldn't run from the front door to pick the newspaper off of
the front lawn this morning.  Pitiful.  Too bad you can't see and hear me
moan.  I'll just write it a couple of times.  Moan, moan.  There, that's
better.
Plans for Turkey Day?  Want to run a 5 K with Ann and I?  It'll be fun.
Let me know.  You know, I think Ann is going to Michigan, so it'll just be
me.  Maybe I'll just stay home and stuff my face.
Megan is very weak.  I sure do love that kid.
Well, don't work too hard.
See ya, Becky

Kathy,

I have attached  a copy of the P&L that was reported as of January 31 for 
Canada.  You will notice that Disturnal's P&L is no longer reported as part 
of Canada, however I have included his p&l  for tieout purposes.  If you have 
any questions please let me know.

This is what I have for Canada's p&l for January 2001.  Can you let me know 
what you reported so that we can make sure that it is the same?

Ramesh/Wei,

I just wanted to know what your estimated time was for implementing the code 
to apply basis roll off to the benchmark quantity as well as to the open 
position quantity.  The timing is not critical for our purposes.  I just want 
to make sure it will be available before March bidweek.  If you need any 
information please let me know as soon as possible since  Thursday will be my 
last day in this group.  If you need anything after Thursday please contact 
Binh Pham.  

I have enjoyed working with you both.  Thank you for all your help.

Robin

I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet.  Actually no one's asked that, but 
everyone's asked me when I'm going to Chicago.  There certainly aren't any 
secrets around here.  I never told anyone except Jeff, David, Rock and Binh 
that I was going to Chicago and yet everyone on the floor knows.  

They're putting out the food for today.  And they brought flowers for the 
tables!!  I'm so impressed.  The food's probably not very good is they're 
going to so much trouble to dress it up.  I think it might be tortilla soup.  
Actually, I just found out we're taking Crystal out to eat since tomorrow's 
her last day.  I would invite you but then you'd just be disappointed when we 
left without you.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Ps  Your boss actually has a reason to be stressed today!!  I wouldn't want 
to be in that meeting.

I'm working hard as usual.   I saw you call...don't start screaming yet...I 
had an IT guy and several other people at my desk at the time.   I saw Me, 
Myself, and Irene too.  It was pretty good as long as you're in the mood for 
stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the "sons" got on my 
nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little 
excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  

Well I better get busy.  Bye.

We still need to go to lunch sometime.

My morning was great...no problems, everything nice and quiet the way I like 
it.  But this afternoon has been a little hectic.  Oh, well, it's making time 
go much faster.  Well except for the meeting with disable...that dragged on 
and on.  I'm so excited about getting out of here at a decent time.  If 
people will quit asking me questions so I can finish changing formulas on the 
basis report I'm going to get out of here by 3...that's my goal anyway.  

Talk to ya later,

My day has been great. Well, more and more I realize that my stress is all my

associate does not understand a lot of things because our boss hasn't come up 
with many of the assumptions needed for the project we are working on....... 
and I thought it was all my lack of knowledge.  Anyways, I think I just need 
to learn how to work with my new boss. I need to come up with my own

Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain 
here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make 
my car look like I went driving through mud puddles.  

What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I enjoy 
the fact that this is on your company email.  

I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and 
dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I don't 
think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have two 
right now.  

Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Subject: 'NG' positions roll-off logic

Jeremy,

Here is the roll-off logic for 'NG':

1.  For regular ERMS books (not Intra Month book),  first we get the promptDt,

 promptDt := TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1), 
'MONYYYY'), 'DDMONYYYY');

 Then if p_commodity_cd = 'NG', we go get the cutOff date,
  SELECT exp_dt
           INTO expDate
           FROM egs_expiration_dates
         WHERE expiration_rule_cd = 'Natural Gas Futures'
             AND ref_period_dt = promptDt;

 IF (TO_DATE(p_effDt, 'J') > expDate) THEN
        cutOff := ADD_MONTHS(promptDt,1);
      ELSE
        cutOff := promptDt;
      END IF;

 The strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs table, is computed using 
the following DECODE statement,

 DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(cutOff,'J'))),-1,-2,NULL).

 Positions with strip flag as -2 will be rolled off by V@R program.

2.  For Intra Month books, first we get the nextMonthDt,
 nextMonthDt := 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'MM
')||
        TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'YYYY'), 'DDMMYYYY'),'J'));

 Then if book flag is 'P', the strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs 
table, is computed using the 
 following DECODE statement,

     if pub cd starts with 'GD', then the positions are taken in as 
'FLOATVSFLOAT', and strip flags for
  two legs are,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, -1, 0, 
-1, -1, -2, NULL) and
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL),
  respectively.

     else if pub cd does not start with 'GD', then only positions with 
swap_cd as 'S' are captured as    'SWAP'.  The strip flag is,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL)

 Else if book flag is 'G', the strip flag in rms_deal_legs is hard coded as 1.


Thanks,

Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from 
them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do 
get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the 
closet to hide it in!!  How was that for a run on sentence!  I'm not sure I 
believe we're going to have sleet here tomorrow.  It's still hot and muggy 
outside now.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

Of course I remember you...I'm not that much of a flake.  How long have you 
been back in Houston?  I actually saw you fighting the elevator crowd in the 
lobby several days ago.  We should definitely get together.  Do you have 
lunch plans for today?

Hey Robin,
It's been a while since I have talked with or seen you.  In case you forgot, 
we worked together at LA Tech for Becky.  I am back permanently now as a tax 
analyst.  I am in the rotation program and am working in 3AC for what used to 
be EI for my first rotation.  I thought maybe we could get together sometime, 
go to lunch, and chat.  I would love to hear from you.

Dawn,

Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the 
country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were 
gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without 
you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just 
works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no 
idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  

Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really 
happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't 
tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you 
spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I 
haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment 
that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything 
you don't know.   

Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  

Hope you enjoyed your trip.

Robin

I'm not sure specifically what you're refering to...Do you mean someone on 
the financial book's love life (ie Susan or Kori), or the HR spy?

Glad it worked, now maybe you won't get fired.  Have you gotten something to

 MS DOS definitely does not work for me anymore. It is weird because it works

Have you kept up with any new information about Risk people? You know what I

really slow.  I'll give you a call when I get it.

Kathy/Brian,

As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian 
VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help 
investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files 
that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding 
that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled  
incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not 
being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are 
spelled correctly in all position files.  

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Robin

Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless.  They are 
definitely censoring.   She hasn't answered anything other than the program 
requirements, etc.  What a waste of time.  But I guarantee you they'll bring 
this up as something great they've done to improve communication.

Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would 
have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or 
her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her 
husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories.


Let me know if you change your mind.

I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was.  It's scary, we 
think alike.  I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.  I have soooooo much to 
do today.  Well a lot of it probably won't get done at this point.  I've 
pretty much given up on most of it getting done before I leave.   After work 
I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I 
have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my 
brother's cd.  Oh and I have to pack...can't exactly put that one off any 
more.  But other than that I'm free this evening.  Do you have French?  

I'll call you later.
Robin

Hey Brian,

I'm having to plug your positions again.  I checked the conversion factors 
and I have the same ones that you have on the IM Positions tab of your excel 
file.  Let me know if you have any ideas as to what the problem might be.  
I'm attaching a copy of the positions that I pulled in and the detail.  I'll

Hey,

It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I 
won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which 
means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now 
running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running 
it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all.  

Enough whining for now.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about 
the food one day (well actually I complained a lot, but one day I made an 
official complaint).  Anyway I was telling the guy over the food service that 
the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they 
were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge 
$6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an 
entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of 
the world.  I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him.

You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this 
time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing 
is that Emily finally finished high school.  

I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the 
HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly.  
I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone 
ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's 
office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find 
something out.  

Talk to ya later,

Hey, 
I thought you might enjoy reading this if you have a few minutes to spare.  
It's from Becky, and it sounds just like her.  I thought you might get a kick 
out of what we are missing around there.  

Enjoyed lunch the other day.  We'll do it again sometime.  
Did you find out anything else about going to Chicago?  Keep me updated.

Later,
JoAnne

Hey yourself,
Glad you've gotten to work and have gotten settled.  Of course, now you're
one of the working class.....sounds like you're gonna be busy.  We have been
here-if anything, we're busier than ever.  The auditors are
here ---yuck...and will be til the end of the year probably.  Oh well,
nothing to hide.
Emily is enrolled here-can you believe it?  and Zach decided to help out by
cranking my truck last week.  Emily had left it in gear so now my utility
room has a large opening in it that was not previously there.  He was used
to cranking his dad's automatic car and  boy, did he get a surprise...Oh
well, he's not hurt and the truck and utility room can be fixed.
Had a birthday yesterday.  Jake took me to the Warehouse last night and I
stuffed my face.  Really good.  Seems like you had one a few weeks ago,
yourself.  Happy belated birthday.  Hope it was a good one.  Sounds like
things are going great for you two-buying a house and everything.  Where is
Shannon working?  Is he having to drive far to get to work?
Guess I better get some of this junk rounded up.  Maybe he'll let us go a
few minutes early.  I could handle that...some of my birthday money is going
for a massage in an hour or so...Let us hear from you...send me your address
and I'll add you to my book..
Bye for now, tell Robin hi for me and you keep in touch also.

Becky

Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.


 

Thanks,
Robin

I would like to make sure before year end that the p&l being reporting for 
Canada ( trading profits only) equals what I think it is as per attached:



Would you let me know what you are currently reporting for Canada.

Thanks

Becky,

It's good to have you back...I don't think I've eaten at Luther's since the 
last time we all went together.  Tomorrow's good for me.  How's it going 
being back at work?  Did you have 50 million emails to plow through?

What  you talking about, Willis?  I thought you were in Chicago.  Last I 
heard it was a little bigger than most college campuses.  For sure bigger 
than Tech.  Well I'd write more but I have to go home for my nap.  I'm 
working a double shift so I'm leaving for a nap from about 10-2.  It makes 
the day pass much faster.  

Good night.
Robin

This is like a little college campus. Once you're
here, you're here. If I had a car, I'd drive into town
and explore a bit.

Hopefully there won't be too many delays tomorrow when
I am leaving.

might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer 
that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll

Need something to do?  The lady that sits in your old spot is helping her 
brother with his divorce.  In fact he may not have to anything but show up in 
court!  The details I don't care to hear, but I can't help it.  I can hear 
everything and every day there is some new personal matter that needs to be 
taken care of.  Maybe if she stuck to just her own business she wouldn't be 
on the phone so much and I wouldn't have to hear all the junk.  Gag.  B.

Gary/Susan,

It came to our attention yesterday that the PWR-GAS-LT-MGMT-PRC book is 
included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  This book is officalized by Jenny 
Latham and the position is not reported on the benchmark.  Therefore, I don't 
believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Also please 
ensure that this book is not included in the AGG-GAS portfolio.  

Thanks,
Robin

Brooklyn,

What's going on?  How was your holiday?  I thought about you this weekend.  
We had fried turkey.  It was sooo yummy.  I was going to bring you some, but 
there weren't even crums left.  

Well, I just wanted to brag.  So I'll leave you alone.

By the way, how was your trip to Kinder?  Did you have trouble finding the 
hotel or resturant?

Later,
Robin

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,
Robin

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime 
as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking 
about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now.  

And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for 
breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it 
home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some.  

I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that 
you blew him off.

Jaime just sent me an email apologizing because he could not find me. He said 
that he asked everybody (friends you have not met). A couple of Nicaraguans, 
and  some other colombians.  Before Jaime, Hector and I moved out of Austin, 
I used to hang out with all these people. Harry does not particularly like 
them, but Ramiro was also part of this group.  Anyways, Jaime kept asking for 
Harry's phone number and nobody knew his phone number, so he thinks he stood 
me up. 

Hmmm, what should I say. Should I say I was waiting for his call all weekend 
long, or just tell him the truth?  

Yeahh I want to try your King cake.  I am not hungry at all though. OUr 
assistants kept getting creative every day and our breakfast was getting 
better and better. I am not sure what happened last time they ordered. They 
must have been stoned. We had Peperoni calzone for BREAKFAST!!!!!!!. The 
worst part is that I ate one. My stomach is a little upset.  Too much junk 
food in less than 24 hours.

It's nice to know I have good tastes. I think I did a good job picking out 
both b-day presents. Do you want me to mail a check or do you take Visa?

I decided to let you use them. It's too hot up here to use them. Maybe if it 
ever rains. If you like them, I got them at a store up here for a really good 
price, but you probably have such places down there too. You won't become a 
golf junkie after you find out how much they want to actually let you play 
golf on one of those nice green courses. It's a little more than the driving 
range.

Glad to hear that you're really not a vampire.

My company was named one of the 100 Best managed manufacturing companies by 
Industry Week. It's been a real joke around here. We're not sure what they 
were smoking when they made that decision. (Note the irony in using company 
email to say this...BTW...I have an interview with Arthur Anderson on the 8th)

Paul
>>> <Robin.Rodrigue@enron.com> 8/30/2000 8:21:45 AM >>>

You got her a $100 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store).
You did a very good job picking it out.

Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.  I thought you weren't going to send
them, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.  I'll hold them
for ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!  I actually went to
the driving range this weekend.  I definitely think I could get hooked on
this sport.  Hopefully I won't become one of the "golf junkies" but I'm not
sure you can avoid it.  I was watching a golf infomercial the other day
thinking "I need that!"

Well back to work.  Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Outside of moving the deals to another book, I don't think you can avoid 
liquidating at the end of the month.  So I'm going to leave these in the 
portfolio.

Thanks for the info.

Robin, the book for Todd Richardson is technically dead.  We are the deals 
that are in there monthly.  Is there a better way to do this?  We hate having 
to remember to liquidate it at the end of the month.  I think it deals in 
there until Aug 2001.

Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck 
with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some "lady" just walked by with her pajamas 
on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high 
school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's 
really scary.  

Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later.

I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes 
you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be 
specific!!

Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll 
probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have 
it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no 
later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a 
hotel I'd appreciate it.  

Thanks,

I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the 
same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so 
I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should 
have the "offer" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell 
you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the 
analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in 
the mood for it!!

I'll let you know what I find out.

Well,  you are in a good position because you could sell your car but you 
don't necessarily have to.  In Enron terms this would be called a put option 
and we charge for it, so make sure you pay me premium.    The actual 
paperwork takes no time. It could be done in a day. Now, if your question was 
the time that you can actually find a potential buyer....well, that really 
depends on how much you want for it.  Have you decided on a  "floor".  In 
other words, decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car.   
Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago.  Prices for cars 
vary a little  depending on the city. So see if comparable cars in Chicago 
are selling for less, that way, it might be a good opportunity to try to sell 
it here.  SInce you don't have to sell it, I would check the market very very 
well.  You don't need the money, and you don't need to sell it. You have the 
power. If you decide to advertise it,  don't mention anything about Chicago. 

I'll help you with research later. 

Gabriel

That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually 
changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily 
Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me 
know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow.

Thanks,
Robin

Subject: GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL

Robin,

The current logic for processing Gas Daily books is as the following:

 If it is a Swap deal (swap_cd is 'S' in ERMS), we check two date conditions 
(ref_dt > eff_dt and ref_dt < nextMonthDt);
 If it is a Option deal (opt_cd is 'O' in ERMS), we only check one date 
condition (ref_dt > eff_dt).

That's why you saw prompt month positions for 'GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL', those are 
all from Option deals.  Other Gas Daily books either don't have prompt month 
positions or the delta position is zero, so you don't see it.

The proposed logic change is even for the Swap deals, we only check one date 
condition (ref_dt > eff_dt).  I don't think there will be any double counting 
for books like GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL after the change.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Wei

Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are 
definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can 
stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up 
at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably 
try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and 
catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  

What'cha doing for lunch?

Robin, 

I thought you were just being polite and you felt bad because it was going to 
be a lonely Thanksgiving for me.  So, you were serious about it?   I really 
appreciate that you still keep me in mind, and I apologize for not having 
told you anything. I am sure you probably need to know to plan ahead. 
Ok, here is the plan. Let me make a few phone calls b/c  my best friend  from 
Cd. Juarez (border with El Paso, TX) said he  was going to Austin for that 
weekend  but nothing is for sure. Also, Ramiro was planning a trip, but I 
don't feel that bad If I decline b/c you know he loves finding foreigners to 
travel with. He actually already found somebody.   

Honestly, I did think about it, and I was a little worried that maybe you 
want to spend quality time with family and friends and I will be a perfect 
stranger there. (Ok, here is your chance to say "yeahh,  maybe you are right" 
"I want to spend time with my F & F)  Or if you are still being polite, then 
let me get bactk to you on that after I make those phone calls. 

THank you.

Hey,

How's your day going?  Mine's been really good...I probably shouldn't have 
said that.  I've actually felt like I'm accomplishing something today.  Isn't 
that novel?  We have Treebeard's for lunch today, YUCK.  It was actually 
pretty funny.  We weren't supposed to have food today, but the Treebeards 
delivered for the traders on the wrong day, so we get a free lunch.  

What are you doing for lunch?  I don't think I can handle Treebeards, so I 
was thinking of going to Subway.  Wanna go?

Bye.

Yeah that very interesting.  What exactly is the origination team doing now 
that they've already signed the deal with blockbuster?  Are they trying to 
sign up customers or providers or what?

Vern,

I spoke with Annemieke and she said that you would be the person to contact 
about adding a report to the executive viewer.  We need to add a gas report.  
The title of the Report will be Natural Gas Basis by Trader.  I am attaching 
a copy of the report that will be published.  Please let me know if you need 
any additional information.  

Thank you for your help,
Robin

Brian, please see the file below.  It  represent an example of a spreadsheet 
that we use on a regular basis for uploading positions.  I am sure that you 
guys are familiar with the format and what goes where.  The important thing 
is to have the book name and the reference dates and the delta positions all 
correct.  Call me if any questions.

Brian,

Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it 
into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 
17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that 
would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all 
unique what you had was fine.

If you have any more questions just give me a call.



Thanks,
Robin

We just passed out the reports.  That should tell you how my day's going.

I've dragged you to two country concerts, so you can pick this one.  Either 
is fine with me.  I promise.  Mom and I did have a good weekend.  We were 
laughing last night b/c we really didn't do anything.  We just sat around and 
talked and watched movies all weekend.  She said to tell you she's sorry she 
ruined your weekend.  I told her you didn't mind that she was here.  

What'd you end up doing last night?

What...A tax book not helpful?  Aren't you glad you didn't have to suffer 
through that class?  Everything went fine this morning.  I just had to 
rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!  Lavo seemed happy 
with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get 
much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to 
bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and 
look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other 
than that I'm okay.

And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?

Talk to ya later,

Hi!
How is it possible that my Financial Statement Analysis book was more helpful 
than your Tax book as far as how to handle NOL accounts?
It was not even worth carrying that heavy book. Just kidding, thank you very 
much anyways.  Was everything ok this morning?

I felt bad I left really late last night. I hope you got some good rest. 
Glad you are back at work?

Robin,
As of the end of the 13th Clark had a Sumas Intramonth Position of 2 
contracts.  

Regarding prompt physical and gas daily positions I don't think that the risk 
is being correctly reflected on the basis reports for Canada given the way 
our market trades (despite what Lavo says he wants).

Kathy,

I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position.  
Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to 
find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato 
requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other 
traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are 
not shown on this report.  

Brian,

I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let 
me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report 
containing December 12th basis positions.  

Thank you for your help.

Robin,
I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do 
Disturnal, Lambie & McKay



I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the 
following:
1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the 
spreadsheet.
2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not 
being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this 
month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be 
picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For 
example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM 
traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco 
prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek).

Kathy

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

How do you come up with all this?  Did someone teach you how to write 
accomplishments?  This is awesome.  I hadn't thought about integrating my 
goals into my accomplishments.  And you consider me an overachiever!!

Thanks.

How much did you pay for your clubs?  By the way, I thought using company 
email was a nice touch.  We were named one of the top 100 companies to work 
for...number 24 to be exact.  They are pushing for #1 next year.   I think 
it's the Analyst program that's holding them back right now!!!  

Well back to pretending to work.  Right now I'm training and there's nothing 
to do in the middle of the day with this job, so there are two of us trying 
to stay busy doing nothing right now!  

Later,

You got her a $100 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store).  
You did a very good job picking it out.  

Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.  I thought you weren't going to send 
them, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.  I'll hold them for 
ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!  I actually went to the 
driving range this weekend.  I definitely think I could get hooked on this 
sport.  Hopefully I won't become one of the "golf junkies" but I'm not sure 
you can avoid it.  I was watching a golf infomercial the other day thinking 
"I need that!"  

Well back to work.  Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?

Talk to ya later,
Robin

We saw an even better one the other day.  Someone was trying to sell a 1972 
Calladic Hurse.  It's white with orange flames on the front fenders!!!  And 
it has a huge stereo system in the back.  Now what kind of freak owns 
something like that and why would you announce it at work?

While waiting for the computer guy to fix my software connections I went 
browsing on the "For Sale" bulletin board.  Some lady is selling a Ball 
Python.  The high points of the snake included the comment that it has "never 
bitten" anyone and that it come with an exercise stick.   If you were a 
snake, would you bite someone with an exercise stick?  Sounds like a time 
bomb to me.The stupid snake also comes with a bed and a light!  Is that so it 
can read in bed?  Who cares about a stupid snake.  The things people try to 
sell.  FYI.  B

Christmas.  And Rock's off that week so there's no chance I could take off.   
I'll just have to stay here all by myself.

For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!


When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

Chris,

Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need 
any more information.

Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen 
sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total 
of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by 
a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 
contracts over the same period.

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,
Robin

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

Hey Becky,

Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was 
something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that 
would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear 
you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your 
knee doing by the way.  

I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people 
just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong.  
And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of 
the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They 
finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's 
actually going to happen.  

You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean 
I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one 
person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple 
of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna 
hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of 
sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit 
blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk 
to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in 
the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really 
interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying 
to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living 
somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the 
interview, much less to live up there.  

Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too 
bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really 
is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer 
than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we 
really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when 
we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of 
October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for 
Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious 
that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's 
been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review 
each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone 
we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's 
said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It 
really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and 
he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the 
questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  

Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but 
sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to 
hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  

Robin

so I'm going to research that further.  Let me know if you have any

separate portfolio named trader under the Lavorato Other region.  

Please let me know when this book is set up.

Stacey,

I have a couple of questions for you to ensure that we report the positions 
correctly.  First, is this a Power East or Power West book?  Second, when can 
we expect to be reporting positions in this book?  Finally, who is the trader 
for this book?

Thanks for your help.

In order for you to capture the positions for the GAS bench, does the book 
need to be included within any GAS portfolio?


I look forward to your responses.

See now I think you should stay with risk. Yeahh.I think you are better off 
there. he he he. You know this means that if you go to EBS our stock can 
actually go down. No, what it really means is that I might have to help the 
new person if you are really busy. Personally I do not like the idea.  

Ok, I'll ask Ibrahim about this friend of his.  

As for golf practice, we'll see if the weather turns out to be ok. I'll send 
you an email once I know this guy's name, ok?

I was asking what you thought about  the whole EBS thing, not about my 
nervousness.

Kathy,

I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie 
to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the 
file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already 
reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An 
adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.

Actually I'm only waiting on two books.  And the price book is already done.  
Can you believe that?  Talk to you later.

I'll call when I get home.  That is if I get home at a decent time.

I didn't want this just popping up on your screen.  

So far it's just getting worse!!!  I've already been up there three times 
today and of course each extra trip lowers the P&L.  He must think I'm the 
biggest idiot in the world.  I'm going to have to change my name to get 
another job after he fires me.  When he saw me standing outside his office 
this last time he just spread his hands like what could possible be wrong 
now!!  

If you want to make a lot of money and are willing to take this job back 
now's your chance.  I think John would pay you $100,000 to take back over.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,
Robin

Subject: Executive Reports Add-In

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  



Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

You guys should submit an eRequest to get access to all the Gas Reports on 
the Executive Viewer.  Here's a list of the reports you'll want.

Origination Schedule
Natural Gas Prices
Natural Gas Basis Positions
Natural Gas Profit & Loss by Book
Natural Gas Net Fixed Price Positions by Book
Natural Gas Basis by Trader

Also, Brad you need to request access to the O:/Bench directory so that 
you'll be able to save a copy of the NGPL in this directory each night.  

Bilal, you'll need access to the O:/Gas_Trad and O:/Bench directories.

Tomorrow I'm going to be here really early in the morning, so I'll probably 
be tired tomorrow night.  But I could go to the concert if you can get 
tickets.  B/c Thursday I'll have to pack and get some sleep for my flying 
trip to Chicago Friday.  

Bye,
Robin

It's official.  I'm going to start up there March 12th.  As for a place to 
live, I'll probably make a quick trip up there sometime next week to look at 
apartments.

Hey Richard,

I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just 
waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible 
March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  

I'll let you know if anything changes.

What's going on?  I haven't heard from you in awhile.  Laura indicated to me 
that she was able to do something with the analyst program to hopefully solve 
your cost of living issue.  We would still love to have you in Chicago.  Let 
me know what you are thinking.

You may have told Laura, but I haven't spoken to her much in the last couple 
of weeks and we were all wondering up here in Chicago.

I think we should park at Samy's again.  What have you been up to today?  
I've been "training" Bilal.  It's really hard to be patient answering 
questions when you are trying to get something done quickly.  He asked me who 
knew the reports besides me.  I told him it was going to be up to him and 
Binh to know all the reports.  I told him I wasn't going to leave my new

Me bored??  I think you must be more bored than me to talk about ear 
cleaning.  There's this new person that sits down the row from me and she 
baby talks...what's up with that!  It's so irritating.  Well now that I've 
gossipped about someone 10ft from me I better send this email before someone 
walks by and reads it.  I think I'll skip the run this week.

Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get your email until 
yesterday afternoon.  I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I.  It's 
really hard to sit still and think about swaps and options when I'd rather 
think about Sydney!  But I guess it's better than being at my desk all day.  
The days are pretty slow.  It doesn't really get busy here until 3:30 or so.  

Bye,
Robin

Kathy,

Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate 
your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a 
unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy 
format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.

Thanks,
Robin

I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably 
don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to 
class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs.  

I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm.

Ivonne,

Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my 
paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any 
expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I 
turn it in to?

Thanks,

Hey girl,

I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the 
people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having 
me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm 
just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this 
week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's 
been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday 
so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave 
without saying goodbye.  We'll have to get together for lunch once I have 
some definite plans.  

Talk to ya later...Enjoy your day off.
Robin

Robin,

I have set it up for this spreadsheet and I already ran it in stage 
database.  The only error message I got was 'OPT_CLASS_CD INVALID'.  
Option_class_cd should be one of the following: 'AMR', 'ASI', 'ASM', and 
'EUR'.  'USD' in the spreadsheet is more like a currency_cd.

Hey Richard,

I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just 
waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible 
March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  

I'll let you know if anything changes.

You may have told Laura, but I haven't spoken to her much in the last couple

PS if you catch the cruise in New Orleans  after Christmas, do you think 
you'll make it to Veracruz for New Year's Eve.

manner.  

1) Sort by book id, then by master deal id, then by reference date.  
2) The dates must be in the following format.  4-Mar-97
3) The book names must be the same every day.  
4) If the cell should contain a number please put a zero if there is no

Lynn,

I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to 
arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling 
my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these 
dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the 
necessary arrangements.

Thank you for your help,
Robin

Ramesh,

Here is the reconciliation of the portfolios.  The third sheet shows what 
books need to be added to Agg-gas and what needs to be added to Agg-Gasiv.

Hey Guys,

We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I 
have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the 
book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen 
that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please 
look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any 
questions feel free to give me a call.

I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please 
take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For 
instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you 
show a position of long 241 contracts.  




Thanks,
Robin

Unless you want to do it, I'd give it to her.  I hate just standing by 
someone's desk waiting for them to see me and get off the phone.

I'm so impressed.  You mean you actually got to leave the building...wow.

I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no 
idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make 
her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet 
b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of 
other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for 
Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the 
weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention 
of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the "secret" lasts.  
Was she mad at you?

Talk to ya later,
Robin

I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call 
the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually 
make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  

Now get back to work!!

Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my 
Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you 
like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter.  

Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears 
were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I 
expected.  My favorite part was when Pat Summitt was whining and the crowd 
starting chanting "Sit down, Pat!" 

Keith and Susan was crazy as usual.  I had a blast over there.  

Talk to ya later.  Good luck with your trip.

So how is Ruston? Anything exciting going on?

I'm heading to Chicogo this week. (St. Charles
actually) I'm hoping that I will even make it. The
weather is so bad up there that they are cancelling
flights now. And what am I supposed to do once I'm
there? Do you think that this poor little Texas boy
has ice and snow clothes? What use would I have for a
wool coat down here. I'm going to freeze my tushy off.

Frank,
Please find enclosed the PL/SQL scripts that are called from the two C 
programs below. The ERMS packages handle all of ERMS positions, with specific 
handling of Canadian and Intra month positions. The power package handles all 
of ENPOWER databases(Australia, Europe and US) and EXPOWER(US only). The 
spreadsheet handling is an entirely different process which specifically 
handles text files extracted from spreadsheets.

The 'C' programs control the calls to the PL/SQL packages. The ERMS package 
also decides on the strip flag for intra month positions.

Regards,
Ramesh

Other than coming down to entertain me there's really nothing you can do.  Go 
Home and get some sleep so you can drive tomorrow!!

I'll call you later.

Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind 
of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't 
submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though.  

How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your 
boss yesterday?

Later,
Robin

Did you finish all your evaluations?  

I haven't .  I called  PEP and they are going to shut the system down at 
midnight tonight.  Just wanted to let you know in case you are planning on 
having an awesome friday afternoon like I am.  I am going to bring popcorn 
and a good CD.
