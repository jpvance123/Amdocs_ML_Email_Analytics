This is to advise you that Stan is required to attend an Enron off-site meeting the afternoon of October 24; therefore, we will need to reschedule our half day staff meeting.      Please be aware that it may be rescheduled on short notice and you may need to clear your calendar to accommodate, and I apologize to you in advance for that inconvenience!

I will be in communication.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Please accept my apologies; I just saw the notice of this meeting a few minutes ago.  (I also did not review my voicemail timely enough...)  My wife stopped by the office at 3:30 and I accompanied her and my daughter to the Medical Center for an appointment.
 
I will be in the office tomorrow and will follow up to see how I can help out in this effort.
 
Rick

I wanted to confirm where we are and give you the chance to redirect me if =
necessary.  I understand that John Goodpasture expects to leave, apparently=
 around the end of the month.  I have also been advised that Steve Dowd is =
getting up to speed on the MOPS deal and will be prepared to jump in if nec=
essary.  Per my conversation with John this morning, I understand John inte=
nds to validate the list of open issues with Dan McVay today.  It is possib=
le that the key issue--the "material adverse effect" clause--has been elimi=
nated along the lines you, John and I outlined in your office about 10 days=
 ago.   If not, we will need to discuss with you our recommendation for res=
olving the open issues by tomorrow or Wed. and then present that recommenda=
tion to Stan for his decision as necessary.  Armed with that decision on th=
e scope of our authority, John would be able to try to close the deal this =
week.  If that chronology holds up John's departure plans should not be a p=
roblem.  Otherwise, the handoff to Steve will need to happen and we'll clos=
e the remaining issues as soon as possible thereafter.  I will keep you pos=
ted on any material changes in where we are.  Thanks. DF

Bullets for NNG Marketing:

Midwest
MidAmerican: Pleasant Hill - Preliminary agreements are being drafted concerning an escrow funding arrangement to address concerns of MidAmerican on Northern's credit worthiness with regard to the proposed Pleasant Hill Generation facilities.

Terra Chemicals: After multiple discussions with Terra concerning their ability to activate an offset provision with Northern and other Enron affiliates, payment was received for their November 2001 reservation invoice of $309,000.

Viking Gas Transmission:  NNG officially entered the recent VGT open season by requesting 35,000 MMBtu/day of delivery capacity at Browerville, MN ( a new TBS for VGT) and a receipt point at Chisago (the existing NNG interconnect).  This request is made in an attempt to lower ProjectMax expansion costs.  Our goal is to make this transaction work for $0.02/MMBtu/day.  This would be for the winter only, 15 years, beginning 11/1/2003.

Duluth:  Negotiations with Duluth regarding avoiding a bypass have been slowed by Bud Krause, Manager of Systems Operation.  He is indicating that he now feels that there may not be enough "value" in the deal for Duluth.  Bob Stevens is setting up a meeting with NNG management and Duluth. 

Pricing & Storage
Pipeline Capacity.  Analyzed (in conjunction with Facility Planning and Gas Control) potential model changes that provide for incremental 60 mm/d Zone EF capacity and 100 mm/d of Demarc-North capacity that will require minimal facility changes (Sean Bolks has been key in this effort).

FDD.  Review possiblities for purchasing 3rd party storage for potential backstopping of FDD requests that were received during the recent open season.  We received requests for 3-5 Bcf of FDD above our ability to provide service from our own facilities.

Transport Deal.  Finalize Jan - Mar Tenaska transport deal for Field capacity.  Total demand charges of ~$540,000.

Preparing to capitalize on incremental transport and storage deals that may arise due to colder Market Area weather that is anticipated for the next 6 - 10 days.

TI Business.  Continue Field Area TI business analysis in an effort to maximize value from TI shippers.


Project Development
Project MAX / MGO - Contacted Wayne Fransdal this Friday to review the latest information regarding options to serve requirements of the Benson branchline. Identified critical facility scope and cost issues that need to be shared with Wayne to drive the decision process and structure a deal that will be acceptable. Will be working with Facility Planning to complete the information and run through our rate model.
Project MAX / Excel - Received a late request from NSPWis requesting incremental service on the La Crosse branchline. Info forwarded to Facility Planning. Will analyze impact to other shippers that participated in the Open Season on a timely basis and decide how to handle the late request. Hopefully, will be able to accommodate NSPWis w/o any problems.
JAL - Working on a proped sale of facilities to Sid Richardson and a proposal to review w/ management. Goal is to have the package ready by the end of next week or week after. 
CO2 ISSUE - Continue to work w/ Facility Planning to develop the best alternatives utilizing the treating facilities at Lyons. Goal is to have the project fully scoped by the end of the year.

Pam:
Good news, someone came by last week in regard to the TV cable but, he got away before I could introduce myself and ask about the installation and timing.

Please advise (a date) when we can expect both the TV monitor and desk top copier.  Thanks.

As a follow up to our call today, please obtain a specific date that we can expect the TV monitor set-up.  It would be a shame to install cable and TV set-up and move in the next month.  

Also note that I have not heard from Iain regarding options on the table top desk copier.  Please advise status and date of expected delivery.

Thank you for your assistance.

Dynegy Seems To Have Options In Enron Deal
By Rebecca Smith and Robin Sidel
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

With the stock market telling Dynegy Inc. that energy trader Enron Corp. is=
n't worth even half what Dynegy has offered to pay, analysts and investors =
are paying close attention to the circumstances under which Dynegy could ba=
rgain a lower price or even walk away from the merger deal.=20
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy offered to buy its far larger cros=
s-town rival in an all-stock deal that currently values Enron shares at $10=
.85 apiece, or a total of about $9.2 billion. But in the wake of post-agree=
ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=
tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.=
 trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=
ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=
r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.
Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under=
 the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=
ent with Enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as=
 some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20
Dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend, =
seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=
red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that=
 some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved=
 assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=
ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "=
accounting error" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=
ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=
s.=20
An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the=
 deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=
o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=
sions "are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=
holders." Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=
t.=20
Clauses related to a "material adverse change," also known as a "material a=
dverse effect," have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=
onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=
conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=
tions.=20
But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=
onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=
t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =
groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =
envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20
Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=
hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=
sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=
t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=
P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=
ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =
accounting issue.=20
In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=
. Strine Jr. wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company =
has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=
ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=
lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=
her than months."=20
That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=
ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=
ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=
dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=
ld qualify as a "material adverse change," or MAC.=20
A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =
is "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is=
 it just a hiccup," says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=
uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =
a court "may be skeptical" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=
ment disclosures were a surprise.=20
The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=
er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=
antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=
ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million "topper fee" to Dyneg=
y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20
Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation=
 liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=
e liabilities hit $3.5 billion "an Enron material event will be deemed to h=
ave occurred," presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=
ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20
Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=
es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=
vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=
es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by=
 officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=
enses.=20
Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=
ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =
give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=
s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =
worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=
fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=
requent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=
ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=
gy to terminate the deal if "any representation or warranty of Enron shall =
have become untrue."=20
Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=
ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=
peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=
ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utili=
ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its "duty of good fai=
th and fair dealing" and said the New Mexico company tried to "sabotage" th=
e deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=
he accusations.

NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to r=

The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which=
 measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge invest=
or sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading sess=

VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money =
managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor=
 optimism.=20
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid=
 victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Fe=
deral Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for sev=
eral weeks following the attacks.=20
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strat=
egy at Credit Suisse First Boston. "Typically, going into the Thanksgiving =
and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in impl=
ied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets o=
utside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels," Mr. To=
ikka wrote in a recent research note.=20
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the t=

The Corporation: Acquisitions
The Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy Trading
By Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=
r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=
e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=
man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=
g for more oil and gas.=20
Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=
. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =
planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is=
 making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =
business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy=
 and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=
ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=
s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=
nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=
nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.
The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming=
 a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=
il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=
vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which=
 should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=
wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have=
 margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=
er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20
Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=
e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=
ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =
sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=
s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.=
=20
Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=
nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say. And they expect O'Re=
illy to use some of that to make more buys; the most likely target is a nat=
ural-gas company. Maybe it's not so bad being No. 4.

BusinessWeek

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

As Houston-based Enron Corp. imploded amid a dizzying scandal over its fina=
nces, few would have blamed Dynegy Inc. CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat=
 back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=
sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=
ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20
Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=
EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =
didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=
e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=
wer could be: Bail us out.
So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =
Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=
ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =
p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=
nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=
llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=
o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up=
 Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=
gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20
Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=
00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =
that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=
I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=
en incredible to watch.''=20
Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=
t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=
00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =
of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control=
 an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=
.=20
That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading=
 operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company=
 to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=
rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=
ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=
ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=
er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=
000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=
d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=
h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=
ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=
h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =
says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=
t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=
ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=
ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=
e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=
ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=
xceed $3.5 billion.=20
Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not=
 a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=
on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=
ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =
was.''=20
But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting=
 tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=
icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=
997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=
nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is=
 still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =
weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=
ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities=
 Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=
ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=
nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=
rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =
Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=
s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=
ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=
ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=
hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=
ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=
ement job with the new company.=20
Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=
g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=
sed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.=
 ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =
at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Tr=

CONFUSED ABOUT EARNINGS? You're not alone. Here's what companies should do-=

(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)

In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard=
 to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=
ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=
, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=
hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It=
 was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had=
 announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=
ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=
nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=
clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a=
 billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's=
 net worth.=20
Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=
rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=
ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=
ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory=
 that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =
companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=
ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.
Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=
e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =
the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=
n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=

to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=
s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=
k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=
uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=
ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=
ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =
the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20
Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =
decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =
results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=
ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=
d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=
y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=
ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=
t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=
t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =
answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20
Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=
ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are=
 woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=
mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,=
 and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=
o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=
counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =
noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =
those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=
nce of ongoing operations.=20
That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=
ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=
mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=
ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says=
 Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =
is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =
perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20
What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=
d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=
vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=
t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=
r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =
early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=
llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=
tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=
d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=
rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20
``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=
as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of=
 hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=
gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to=
 evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=
e better all know what we're looking at.''=20
Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=
erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street=
 is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=
rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=
.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First=
 Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=
he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=
panies.)=20
The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use=
 First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =
modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=
g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20
How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating=
 operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =
or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=
reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=
ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=
entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=
ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=
llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=
rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter=
 within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =
the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=
P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=
o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=
rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=
he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired=
 KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''=
=20
That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=
ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=
arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=
mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=
le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=
cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=
r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=
,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=
les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20
Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=
ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=
asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =
is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=
ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=
ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =
and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=
s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and=
 investors are free to ignore everything else.=20
There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =
asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=
ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=
.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =
SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=
sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =
and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=
to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=
ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=
d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net=
 income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=
ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =
five years added up to only $5 billion.=20
Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=
off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of=
 hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=
arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=
scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=
. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=
ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=
s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers=
 analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=
-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=
rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =
eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=
ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs=
 of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=
erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=
f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=
nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of=
 an asset.=20
When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=
nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group=
 included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=
AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=
ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=
s.=20
The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=
inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =
Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=
rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =
to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In=
 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=
ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =
In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=
r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =
still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=
other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=
les.=20
The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =
changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=
ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=
es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=
mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So=
 GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=
y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=
s out in their unaudited press releases.=20
Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=
g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=
ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=
re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=
wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide=
 missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=
ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =
investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=
ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20
The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=
ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=
stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=
to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=
ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=
chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=
tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=
rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=
se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=
ir pro forma calculations.=20
Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =
of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=
ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=
hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =
Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=
ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =
was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =
Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=
olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=
an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=
ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=
ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =
tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains=
 in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in=
 its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=
e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer=
 maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =
spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=
reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In=
 our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=
here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special=
 charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=
stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =
the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=
12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,=
 and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=
tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are=
 another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to=
 customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=
ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating=
 its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking=
 sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame=
 the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=
n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=
s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=
hed into write-offs.=20
Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=
xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=
gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=
harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=
t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=
n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=
ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =
that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite=
 a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they=
 can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=
ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20
Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=
m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=
sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =
of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =
with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20
Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =
example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=
mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=
ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =
Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=
e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =
in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=
ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=
re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy=
 doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=
anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=
flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=
e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=
s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value=
 falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=
ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=
o take more charges.=20
But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=
here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=
aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =
``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=
ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=
ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20
While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=
es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=
ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =
investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=
funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to=
 plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB=
 Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=
O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than=
 another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20
There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=
store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=
ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income=
 from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=
ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they=
 bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their=
 press releases with the SEC.=20
At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =
numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=
bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment=
 of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=
n is more important to investors.

High-Gloss Glossary
Companies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =
on
their results. Here's what those terms mean:
DEFINING EARNINGS:
NET INCOME
The bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=
P).
Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=
s &
Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.
OPERATING EARNINGS
An adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=
ted
to the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figure
called ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it=
 is
not an audited figure.
CORE EARNINGS
Another term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=
e
calculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything the
preparer wishes.
PRO FORMA EARNINGS
The 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=
s
excludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.
EBITDA
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The
granddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries that
carried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widely
quoted.
ADJUSTED EARNINGS
A new term for pro forma.
DEFINING COSTS:
SPECIAL CHARGES
A general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual and
therefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.
ASSET IMPAIRMENTS
Charges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=
s
current market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=
al
venture-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks at
inflated prices.
GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS
The same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down the
premium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=
s
acquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=
f a
change in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwill
amortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=
s.
RESTRUCTURING RESERVES
An accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down=
 a
portion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=
d
if overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.
WRITE-DOWN
Lowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It is
often excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=
t
long ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cash
costs, such as investment-banking fees.

What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can e=
ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=
s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=
orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=
ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =
New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=
ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=
ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=
g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=
rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =
clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=
rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the=
 global marketplace (page 76).=20
The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=
sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=
odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=
s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=
t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=
od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=
rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.
A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=
AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=
me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=
perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there=
 are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=
ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=
00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=
tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=
P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20
The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =
It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =
and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=
y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=
) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=
rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=
s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=
r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,=
 and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=
uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron still optimistic of averting fina=
ncial meltdown.
By ANDREW HILL and SHEILA MCNULTY.

Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Enron said yesterday it was still expecting outside investors to inject $50=
0m to $1bn into the group, as talks continued to avoid a financial meltdown=
 at the energy trading group.=20
Dynegy, whose rescue bid for its Houston rival is crucial to Enron's surviv=
al, spent last week's Thanksgiving holiday and the weekend reviewing Enron'=
s operations and finances.
Dynegy said it remained "optimistic for the potential of the merger to be c=
ompleted, and in the time-frame we originally announced - six to nine month=
s".=20
Enron's fate depends on a delicate, unofficial pact between its lenders, Dy=
negy, and credit ratings agencies, which have resisted downgrading the grou=
p's debt while the deal is pending.=20
If the pact stays in place, at least $500m is likely to be invested in Enro=
n by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, Enron's key lenders and advisers. A fur=
ther $500m is being sought from private equity firms.=20
But if Dynegy pulls out of the deal, the cash infusion could be put in jeop=
ardy and the ratings agencies could downgrade the debt to junk, triggering =
debt repayments across a network of partnerships and off-balance-sheet vehi=
cles linked to Enron.=20
Enron confirmed yesterday that it was still seeking additional liquidity fr=
om new equity investors, but would not discuss their identities.=20
Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fe=
ll from $9 to $4.74 following a regulatory filing that revealed the extent =
of the group's debt burden.=20
Completion of a $1bn secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigroup, and =
the postponement of a $690m notes repayment due tomorrow were not sufficien=
t to prop up the share price. The bonds also fell to levels consistent with=
 a potential bankruptcy filing.=20
The slide in the share price has encouraged speculation that Dynegy is prep=
aring to renegotiate its all-stock bid, now worth $9.3bn, compared with Enr=
on's market value of $3.5bn.=20
But people close to Enron say renegotiation of the deal would not in itself=

Schwab Chief's Main Theme: Diversification
By Lynnette Khalfani
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- More than two months after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many=
 investors remain edgy. But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has=
 shown remarkable resilience.=20
Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=
s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =
their wits about them.
In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=
f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=
ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=
kes they should avoid.=20
Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20
In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=
nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=
ceptions about risk have changed?=20
I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=
e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =
in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=
tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20
So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=
r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=
arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=
n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20
What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=
hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=
anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =
the markets?=20
I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=
e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=
g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=
untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=
e strength of our government.=20
There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=
ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=
ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=
ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=
t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully=
 before the economy goes up.=20
There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=
e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20
What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =
two or so months?=20
They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn=
't use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =
Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20
Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going=
 to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=
f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: "Thi=
s is still the time to invest."=20
My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, "I just don=
't want to be in the stock market at all." And it's just the time that peop=
le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20
Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=
er child of the last cycle. Or people say, "I'll get back in [the market] w=
hen I see the economy turn around." Well, by the time they see that, it's t=
oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.

Enron Pursuing a Cash Infusion Energy: Company is seeking as much as $1bill=

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. said talks are continuing with potential investors f=
or an infusion of as much as $1 billion as the biggest energy trader tries =
to avoid a collapse of its planned purchase by Dynegy Inc.=20
An investment would ease concern that Enron's weakened finances may prompt =
Dynegy to pull out of or renegotiate the terms of the transaction, which is=
 valued at $23 billion in stock and assumed debt.
Enron is seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in cash but would=
n't divulge details. "We are not going to discuss the particulars of who we=
 are talking to," Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said Sunday.=20
Shares of the Houston company fell by 48% in the last three trading session=
s on the New York Stock Exchange. At Friday's closing price of $4.71, the s=
tock sells for less than half the $10.85 that Dynegy is slated to pay in th=
e acquisition. That's a sign investors are skeptical the transaction will g=
o through as planned.=20
Enron is likely to have approached Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co., Blacksto=
ne Group and Carlyle Group for a private equity investment, said industry a=
nalyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.=20
The firms have declined to comment.=20
In a conference call Nov. 14, Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon=
 said the company is in talks with several private investors and expects to=
 receive $500 million to $1 billion from those sources.=20
On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on a $690-millio=
n note due this week, gaining more time to restructure its finances. Dynegy=
 Chief Executive Chuck Watson said he was "encouraged" by the commitment to=
 extend the note payment as well as the closing of a $450-million credit fa=
cility. He said Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.=20
Enron already received $1.5 billion in cash Nov. 13 from ChevronTexaco Inc.=
 as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In return, Dynegy received preferr=
ed stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural G=
as Co. pipeline. Under the deal's terms, if Dynegy and Enron fail to merge,=
 Dynegy can acquire the pipeline company.=20
But Barron's reported over the weekend that Dynegy's right to the pipeline =
might be challenged by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc=
., which accepted the asset as collateral for $1billion in loans to Enron.=
=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa declined to comment on Enron's attempts to secu=
re financing or whether more cash for Enron is a condition of keeping the m=
erger alive.=20
Enron's dealings with affiliated partnerships have led to a federal investi=
gation of the company, which restated its earnings and saw its credit ratin=
gs cut.=20
The company said in a Securities and Exchange filing a week ago that it has=
 less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left.

Dynegy Optimistic That Enron Merger Will Succeed - FT

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) remains optimistic, after further re=
view of Enron Corp.'s (ENE) finances last week, that it will be able to buy=
 the company, the Financial Times reported Monday.=20
Dynegy said that it, "remained optimistic for the potential of the merger t=
o be completed, and in the time frame we originally announced - six to nine=
 months," the FT reported.
Critical investment in Enron by J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup will procee=
d only if an unofficial pact between Enron, Dynegy, and Enron's lenders and=
 credit rating agencies remains intact, the report said. Investment from th=
ese two is likely to total between $500 million and $1 billion, while Enron=
 continues to look for a further $500 million from private equity firms.=20
The deal suffered a setback last week, when a regulatory filing revealed a =
greater debt burden than some investors had realized. Enron's share price f=
ell following the report, to $4.74 from $9.00.=20
A $1 billion secured credit line from J.P. Morgan Chase and an extension of=
 a $690 million repayment due Tuesday weren't enough to keep the share pric=
e from falling. This led to speculation that Dynegy was considering renegot=
iating its all-stock bid, now at $9.3 billion, compared with Enron's market=
 value of $3.5 billion, said the report.=20
Renegotiating the deal wouldn't have any impact on Enron's finances, unname=
d sources told the FT.=20
But if Dynegy pulled out of the deal altogether, there might be no cash inf=
usion from J.P. Morgan chase and Citigroup. Credit ratings agencies could t=
hen downgrade Enron's debt to junk, forcing partners to repay debts, the re=
port said.=20

Dynegy Purchase Prompts Antitrust Concerns, L.A. Times Says
2001-11-26 07:36 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- California Attorney
General Bill Lockyer is examining Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
acquisition of rival energy seller Enron Corp. for possible
antitrust violations, the Los Angeles Times reported.

     The California Independent System Operator, which manages the
state's electric grid, has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy
and other major power sellers, including Mirant, and AES Corp.'s
Williams Cos., from selling electricity at market prices in the
state, the Times said.

     Throughout the state's power crisis, Governor Gray Davis and
other officials accused Dynegy, Enron and other power companies of
withholding electricity and manipulating the cost of wholesale
power to gouge consumers, the Times said.

     Enron is negotiating with bankers to restructure $9.15
billion in debt.

     ``I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust
implications would consider this one carefully,'' California State
Senator Steve Peace, a Democrat, told the Times. ``If anything,
Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to
manipulate markets than it was before.''

Enron confirmed yesterday it was still seeking additional liquidity from ne=

Enron's crisis of confidence became more acute last week when the shares fe=

Completion of a US$1-billion secured credit line from JPM Chase and Citigro=

The Enron scandal

11/26/2001
Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in ris=
k management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=
d very strong management." James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.=
=20
As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=
agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=
ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =
a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=
are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =
investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=
ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?
No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =
Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=
here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=
nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=
d make an excellent case study!)=20
But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=
out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=
illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=
e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=
d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=
olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =
senior officials were sacked.=20
Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=
cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=
ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20
It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=
ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=
sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was=
 kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To=
 this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron=
 itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=
reshold(s).=20
All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =
mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=
ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=
fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=
s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=
e accounting genius.=20
Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=
he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=
e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million=
 as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20
The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=
nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=
t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=
alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=
ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20
But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=
on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=
nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20
Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack=
ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was=
 always somewhat fragile?=20
But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =
analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=
g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=
are of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg=
ressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified =
the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers=
e" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The =
Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a=
ctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming=
 that "we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo=
lies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.=
" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's =
inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20
For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "=
Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=
hnologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=
g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has=
 not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20
Surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be=
tween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse=
 in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg=
et this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i=
n the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre=
ed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a =
little bit to the left?

India's Mehta Comments on Birla Group Offer to Buy Enron Stake
2001-11-26 03:42 (New York)

     Mumbai, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Jaywantiben Mehta, India's
union minister of state for power, comments on reports of Aditya
Birla Group, which owns Grasim Industry Ltd., the nation's third-
biggest cement maker, bidding for Enron's stake in Dabhol Power
Co.

     Enron wants to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power,
India's biggest foreign investment, at cost. The project is mired
in a tariff dispute over $64 million in bills that haven't been
paid by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only
customer, for eight months.

     ``One more bidder will increase competition, which is
welcome.

     ``Any step in the national interest is good.

     ``Cheap energy is always in the national interest since we
want to increase electricity generation and sell it at a
reasonable price.

     ``I can't comment on the time-frame of buying out the Enron
stake until the legal wrangles are solved. Once that's cleared,
then we will try and clear the proposal quickly.''

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative
2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)

Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative

Fitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enron
securities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt
`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;
and commercial paper `F2'. Pipeline subsidiary `A-` rated
senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co. and
Transwestern Pipeline Co., are also placed on Rating Watch
Negative.

The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital
market reaction to recent disclosures by the company. The
loss of investor and counterparty confidence, if it
continues, would impair Enron's financial flexibility and
access to capital markets, therefore, impacting its ability
to conduct its business. On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron announced
a $1 billion after-tax charge to earnings to be taken in
the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet
equity by $1.2 billion relating to the unwinding of
structured transactions. Since that time, there have been
several damaging news reports on the company and its
management. More importantly, investors have voiced
concerns. Enron's common stock price has plummeted and
spreads on its debt have widened.

The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly
stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its
business. Approximately $1.5 billion of unused liquidity is
available under committed bank lines.

An additional concern is that certain structured
transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II
and Osprey could unwind. While various sources of repayment
exist, such as the sale or liquidation of underlying
assets, or an equity offering, primary credit support is
derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily
convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to
repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120
days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger
event. In the event that the issuance of the preferred
stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the
senior notes in either case, Enron is required to deliver
additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver on
its obligation, then the amount of the deficiency becomes a
payment obligation of Enron, representing a general
unsecured claim. While trigger events include a downgrade
of Enron's senior unsecured debt below investment grade by
one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with
specified declines in Enron's closing stock price over
three consecutive trading days, Enron would have a
forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was
being made to register the shares. The total amount of
Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $3.2 billion. Enron
has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

While capital market uncertainties have escalated, Fitch
has no information to indicate that there are any
fundamental problems with Enron's core wholesale, retail,
and pipeline businesses. Fitch expects to be in contact
with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor
ongoing events and address strategic, longer-term issues.


STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow

10/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Share of Enron were higher in opening trade, after the company dismissed its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, due to his past involvement in running two partnerships, in which Enron had invested, dealers said. 
At 9.56 am, Enron was up 1.13 usd, or 6.95 pct, at 17.55. The DJIA was down 138.60 points at 9,207.52, the S&P 500 index was down 15.95 pts at 1,069.00 and the Nasdaq composite down 39.02 at 1,692.52.
Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow, after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow-related transactions. 
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement. 
Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company. 
McMahon, who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron's Industrial Markets group, had quit his job as treasurer last year, after voicing concerns within the company about Fastow's role in running the two partnerships, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
This morning, Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to "buy- speculative," from "buy-high risk", to reflect his concerns that "lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enron's commercial operations." 
"This is the least likely outcome, in our view, but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked," he said.

=DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings
2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)

   By Mark Golden, Kristen McNamara, Jon Kamp and John Edmiston 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit
quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in
policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the
companies said Thursday. 

  The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of
the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall
by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial
structure. 

  Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of
the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this
week. 

  "We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron," said John
Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). "It's business as usual." 

  Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made
no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and
gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged. 

  Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.

  "Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution," said
Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North
American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A. 

  Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't
expect to make any drastic changes.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos. (WMB) to book $180 million in power sales from the previous period as third-quarter revenues, the company said Thursday. 
The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions.
The state of California has paid more than $11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers, but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the state's ailing utilities in mid-January. Two weeks ago, however, the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back. 
"It's that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO," Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday. 
Williams reported third-quarter net income of $221.3 million on revenues of $2.81 billion, up from $121.1 million on revenues of $2.33 billion in the same period the year before. 
Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales. The process is complicated by the state's role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities, which aren't creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves. The ISO didn't envision third-party guarantors when it set up its settlement process, and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month, state power officials have said. 
The state says it has set aside $1.2 billion to cover ISO transactions. 
As reported, suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free. 
Willing To Renegotiate 

Separately, Williams' officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long-term contracts with California, provided the result benefited both parties. 
California Gov. Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed. 
Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power-supply obligations - perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market, Malcolm said. 
"We're always willing to sit down with a customer," Malcolm said. 
Williams hasn't been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts, Malcolm said. 
Any attempt by California to force through one-sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants, he said. 
"To the extent contracts are changed, financing is going to go away," he said. 
Downplaying Enron Opportunities 

Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market-leader Enron Corp. (ENE), saying it focuses on large, long-term structured deals, not the high-volume, physical-market transactions that Enron dominates, Malcolm said. 
Also, TradeSpark - the Internet-based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner - is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enron's proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ) suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center. 
"That's interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing," Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call. 
Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure. 
Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline, a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades. Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark. 
"We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers," Malcolm said. 
TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc. (ESPD), Cantor Fitzgerald (X.CFZ), Shell (RD) unit Coral Energy, Dominion (D), Koch Energy Trading Inc., TXU Corp.'s (TXU) TXU Energy unit and Williams Cos.' Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Co.

Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic News

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Wall Street Journal Online News Roundup 
Stocks are expected to open with losses Thursday, weighed down by disappointing U.S. economic news and the European Central Bank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged.
About an hour before the New York Stock Exchange opened, futures on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were sharply lower, suggesting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will post a 94-point loss at the opening bell. 
In one of a trio of negative economic reports, the Commerce Department said orders for durable goods, or products expected to last more than three years, tumbled 8.5% in September. That was a much steeper drop than the 0.9% decline forecast by economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. 
Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans filing new claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 504,000 for the week ended Oct. 20. That was more than the 500,000 jobless claims expected by economists. 
The Labor Department also said that the employment-cost index rose 1% in the third quarter, slightly more than expected. The indicator measures changes in compensation costs, including wages and salaries, as well as costs for employee benefits. 
Later, at 10 a.m. EDT, the National Association of Realtors is expected to say that 5.26 million existing homes were sold last month, down from the 5.5 million sold in August. 
Prior to release of the economic news, S&P futures had pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street, after the ECB left rates alone despite growing political pressure for another rate cut to help the stumbling European economy. 
In addition to pouring over Thursday's economic reports, investors will spend much of the session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. 
Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far, Dow Chemical said third-quarter net income plunged 84%, hurt by weak demand, substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning. 
Among other stocks to watch, Enron on Wednesday replaced its finance chief, Andrew Fastow, capping a tumultuous day in which the Houston powerhouse saw its stock price continue to fall sharply. 
States suing Microsoft are hiring one of the nation's top trial lawyers, signaling they may seek a harsher antitrust remedy than the White House. Meanwhile, the software giant's Windows XP formally makes its debut Thursday. 
In key overseas markets, stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index was down 1.2% in intraday trading, while Frankfurt's DAX was 0.9% lower. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.2%. 
In Wednesday's session, Wall Street continued to shrug off disappointing earnings news, and focused instead on hopes that low interest rates and the government's economic-stimulus program will produce a recovery. 
Technology issues saw much of the buying, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 27.10 points, or 1.6%, to 1731.54. The Dow industrials inched 5.54 points, or 0.1%, higher to close at 9345.62, despite substantial losses in two of its components, Eastman Kodak and AT&T, which issued weak outlooks. 
In major U.S. market action Wednesday: 
Major stock indexes advanced. But on the Big Board, where 1.34 billion shares traded, 1,374 stocks rose and 1,743 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.89 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds gained. The 10-year Treasury note rose 13/32, or $4.0625 for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to price, fell to 4.588%. The 30-year bond was up 23/32 to yield 5.330%. Early Thursday, the 10-year note was up 10/32 to yield 4.553% while the long bond was 17/32 higher, yielding 5.303%. 
The dollar was mixed. Late in New York, it traded at 122.87 yen, up from 122.68, while the euro rose against the dollar to 89.35 U.S. cents from 89.07. Early Thursday in New York, the dollar bought 123.17 yen and traded at 88.27 cents to the euro.

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased Enron
Corp. Common Stock

NEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox
(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. and
certain of the Company's officers and directors in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The suit is
brought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the common
stock of Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,
2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").

The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers and
directors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendants
engaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliates
and interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financial
position.  Many of the details of these transactions were hidden from
the public.  Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improve
Enron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at an
artificially inflated price.  Certain Enron executives, who held
positions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts of
interest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from these
transactions.

The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants
made misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron's
Broadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's share
price.  With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would never
post a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued to
make misleading statements about the Broadband business in order to
maintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.
Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadband
business to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars in
financing.  Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financing
arrangements.  Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,
its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron's
finances from its investors and the market, further artificially
inflating Enron's share price.  While the stock was artificially
inflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensive
insider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482
million during the Class Period, before the public became aware of
the above practices.

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and is
represented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP.  Our firm, with offices
in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years of
experience in prosecuting investor class actions and actions

              Mark Haines, co-anchor:

              Joe Kernen, what's going on?

              Joe Kernen, co-anchor:

              We've got to shift gears into this Enron situation which
              has just been--you've been talking about it quite a bit,
              David--how could you not talk about it?  Seventy-six
              million shares yesterday, down fifty percent in the last
              two weeks.  This is a company with--what?--a hundred
              million in revenues.

              James Cramer, guest market commentator:

              Maybe.

              Kernen:  Yeah, right.  Anyone who does any trading in
              energy apparently, you know, uses Enron Online, so anything
              that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize
              the whole energy trading arena and...

              Cramer:  Go ahead, say it!  Say what you're thinking!  No
              one has said it yet.  We know the truth.  We believe that
              Enron caused a national short squeeze.  They knew every
              single number in this gas situation.  They wrecked the
              California utility system and profited from it.  That's my
              bet.  My bet that this--they had--look, they were the
              market maker.  Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going
              to be buying and took it ahead of you.  I think they
              cornered the market for electricity for about four months,
              made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and
              when someone--when the Justice Department gets in there
              we're going to discover this.

              Kernen:  Let's see what happened...

              Haines:  Now, wait a second...

              David Faber, co-anchor:

              Whoa, whoa, whoa!  The Justice Department, Jim?  Now, is
              that new?  Is that something--

              Cramer:  No, that would be, if I were a prosecutor,
              something...

              Faber:  OK, so they are not being investigated?

              Cramer:  Well, no, I'm actually being a little forward
              thinking.

              Kernen:  The SEC wants documents about the limited
              partnership transactions of Mr.--

              Faber:  Which is very different from what Jim is talking
              about.

              Cramer:  No, I'm saying that this is what, if I were an
              enterprising prosecutor, I would say, Did we have a
              nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one
              company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly
              what was happening with the electricity market which then
              wrecked the California utility system, cost the consumer
              billions of dollars, and is now being hushed up?

              Kernen:  Well, let's talk about the actual news.  Here's
              yesterday's trading--

              Haines:  Wait a minute.

              Kernen:  Well, I just want to say that the guy is gone now.
              That's the new news here.  Did you read--did you know that
              Fastow, after four--

              Faber:  Late yesterday.

              Kernen:  Yeah, after four o'clock, Fastow is gone.  What's
              interesting--

              Faber:  He's the CFO--

              Kernen:  But he's a new CFO.

              Faber:  --who benefitted personally from some of these
              off balance sheet partnerships.

              Cramer:  Mark, you know, I'm not on thin ice here, I'm not
              on thin ice.

              Haines:  I just want to make sure we understand that this
              is your theory.

              Cramer:  This is my theory.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  It is just a theory.  It is my opinion.  But I
              think we've got to find out more about that short squeeze
              that occurred.

              Haines:  OK.

              Cramer:  We need to find out whether it was orchestrated.

              Kernen:  The new CFO might help regain some credibility for
              the company because he was the old treasurer who left that
              position a year or so ago because of some disagreements
              with how Mr. Fastow was doing business apparently.  So now
              he's back as CFO and we'll whether that calms the market
              down.

              Faber:  Well, what they need to do-- Joe, they need to come
              clean.  I mean, that is what all the investors in Enron and
              those who've left the company as investors over this last
              week have wanted.  Let's see everything; be as transparent
              as you possibly can be; tell us exactly what we need to
              know.  And as much as they need to come clean with their
              investors, they need to come clean with their trading
              counterparties because that is really what people are
              concerned about.

              Kernen:  Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big
              deal?  Anyone who does trading with them, if their credit
              worthiness were to go--if their credit rating were to go
              down, how would that affect energy trading?

              Faber:  Well, you want to know that they're going to be
              there on the other side and make good on the trades.

              Kernen:  I guess you would, wouldn't you?

              Faber:  Right.  Not that they aren't, but why would you--if
              you can trade with seven other guys--seven other companies,
              maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there.

              Kernen:  Now, why would--

              Faber:  And that would hurt their core business.

              Kernen:  Why are people expecting some type of action from
              the credit agencies, not because of the stock price, right?
              Because of something that could unravel--

              Faber:  Because of something related to these liabilities
              they may have--

              Kernen:  That they don't know about at this point.

              Faber:  --that they may have with regard to funding some of
              these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped
              in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at
              the off balance sheet partnership.  Will it be a liability?
              They don't know.  But that's one of the reasons--

              Kernen:  We're talking hundreds of millions or billions?

              Faber:  They don't know.

              Kernen:  But there were billions of dollars in limited
              partners?

              Faber:  Yes.  About three billion in financing, I think is
              what some analysts estimated.

              Kernen:  This is a pretty big number.

              Faber:  Yeah, they can get to most of that with the assets
              that they have in the partnerships themselves.

              Kernen:  I use a six month chart to show what's happened
              over the last two weeks.  You got to look at here.  But if
              we went back a year, you'd see eighty as far as the high
              for Enron.  Now we're at sixteen.

              Faber:  Everybody else took a hit yesterday.  Dynegy got
              hurt.

              Kernen:  Well, I got Dynegy next.  Don't--  Here we go.

              Faber:  I'm sorry.  I'm getting a little excited.

              Kernen:  You are.

              Faber:  Enthusiastic about your charts.

              Kernen:  There's a weekly chart of Dynegy, and you know
              what's coming next, don't you?  Now I'm worried about the
              utility average.  I've worried about the transportation
              average a lot in my career.  Mark, now the utilities have
              replaced my worries.  I'm angst-ridden.  Did you see this
              chart?  We're breaking below the--

              Cramer:  That's a positive, not a negative, Joe.

              Kernen:  What's wrong with Cramer today?  What happened?

              Cramer:  I'm all fired up!

              Faber:  He really is.  My, God, he's got the DOJ getting
              all crazy, the FBI, the CIA.  You going down to En--you
              going down to Houston yourself?

              Cramer:  I may just have to.  I may have to clean up that
              whole city.

              Kernen:  Jim, why would the--that's the--now getting down
              to the lows, I mean, the other averages have come back
              quite a bit from the post-attack lows, the utilities are
              retesting those.  That's not something to worry about?

              Cramer:  No, because I think there's a lot of money going
              into more cyclical issues.  I think the economy is showing
              signs of getting better.  The consumer is certainly much
              stronger than we thought.  The base book didn't say the
              corporate was strong, but the consumer is strong.  Much
              stronger than before.

              Kernen:  All right.  In the past people have worried about
              the utility averages being a leading indicator, though.  I
              don't--we're talking about four hundred to two-ninety at
              this point.  That's a long way.

              Cramer:  This average has got a lot of problems to it, but
              I still think that--

              Kernen:  It's no longer the--

              Cramer:  --you sell this as safety.  We don't want safety
              as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality.

                        # # #

Please note that Husker gear (sweatshirts, wind jackets and hats) will be given out on the plane.  


Thank you for agreeing to join Enron at the Huskers vs. Oklahoma game on Saturday, October 27th in Lincoln, Nebraska.

The game time has not been determined (Game time is at 11:00 a.m.) and a tentative flight schedule for the Houston attendees is as follows.  

7:00 am departure from Houston and 4:00 pm departure from Lincoln.    

The flight times may adjust when the game time is determined.  

I will furnish information and directions to the Enron hanger closer to the game date.

    It looks like you're going to need some help on your bonus numbers based on your team's performance.  I have an extra $24,500 that you can have now.  Use it if you need to.

Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)

     (Adds comment from CFO Fastow in fourth paragraph, Enron's
short-term borrowing rates in seventh paragraph.)

     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggest
energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 million
loan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cut
off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.

     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the company
said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its
finances. The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75
percent this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends
on a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to
finance day-to-day operations.

     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13
billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch for
possible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,
any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial paper
market and raise the costs of short-term debt.

     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to both
the capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's Chief
Financial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.
He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,
giving it enough cash to operate normally.

     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to
$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.

     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,
declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declined
to comment.

                      Commercial Paper Rates

     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper until
Oct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companies
with the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not on
credit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for a
possible downgrade.

     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance and
advice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised the
company on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-
fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, along
with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billion
loan.

     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying two
partnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadership
of them was a conflict of interest.

     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliated
companies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors.

     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buy
and sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on its
books.

     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forced
to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners in
cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may have
to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron's
debt ratings fall too far.

Enron CFO: Company Has Sufficient Liquidity
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.
In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. 
The procedures were "rigorously followed," Lay said. 
In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were "reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties." 
Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. 
The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. 
During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. 
Lay said the company would be providing a list of "Frequently Asked Questions" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. 
After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. 
Lay said he was "extremely disappointed" in the current stock price. 
"Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business," he said. 

During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. 
Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. 
Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. 
Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a "worst-case scenario." 
However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. 
Moody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. 
According to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. 
"We are committed to maintaining our ratings," Lay said. "Moody's said they would work with us," he added. 
Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have "sufficient liquidity" to meet all its capital requirements. 

Enron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. 
Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
"Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that," Lay said.

Enron says shareholders' 'best interests' were sought in all LJM dealings

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp said it sought the "best interests" of its shareholders in all its dealings with LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships which were set-up and run until recently by Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
"The board (of Enron) was fully aware and kept a real Chinese wall between Enron and LJM. Enron's shareholders best interests were sought in all LJM dealings," said Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay, in a conference call with analysts.
The company scheduled the call after Enron's stock slid 21 pct yesterday, when it revealed the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. 
Overnight, two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against Enron and its officers, alleging that operating results were also "materially overstated" as a result of the company failing to timely write-down the value. 
In its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, of 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders' equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow resigned from the partnerships in July, due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests. 
During the call, Lay said that he, and Enron's board of directors, have "the highest faith and confidence in (Fastow)." 
Lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations, and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating. 
Analysts have raised the possibility that, should Enron's credit rating and stock price continue to fall, the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with.

US class action suit filed against Enron for misleading statements

10/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against Enron Corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between Jan 18, 2000 and Oct 17, 2001, thereby inflating the company's share price artificially. 
The suit was filed on behalf of Enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the US District Court in Houston against Enron Corp, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned recently, and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. 
The suit claims that Enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy.
The company's operating results were also "materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships" managed by the company's CFO. The suit additionally alleges that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. 
On Oct 16, Enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non-recurring charges of 1.01 bln after-tax, or 1.11 usd per share, which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's chief financial officer. Enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd. 
Enron's share price consequently fell sharply. During the class period, Enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally-held Enron common stock. 
Holders of Enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than Dec 21, Milberg Weiss said. 
Yesterday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions.

Word of SEC probe puts Enron into deep dive: Problems mount

NEW YORK - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20% yesterday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.
The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. 
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took US$1.01-billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined US$5.49, or 21%, to US$20.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shaving off almost US$4.2-billion of its market capitalization. 
The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8% yesterday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related-party transactions" involved the partnerships. 
"Related-party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Mr. Fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy- and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported US$35-million of its third-quarter loss of US$638-million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. 
"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." 
The price of shares in the company is down 75% this year.

in New York 
ENRON, the American power giant, saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.
The Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which Mr Fastow has, or had, links. 
Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement: "We welcome this request. We will co-operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." 
Questions were raised last week on Wall Street after the company announced a write-down of more than $1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses. 
The disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23pc. Yesterday they fell another $5.30 ( #3.80) to $20.75 in early trading. 
According to the annual report the "related party transactions", as Enron describes them, took place in 1999 and 2000, resulting in losses of $16m and $36m respectively. 
Mr Lay said that auditors approved the deals, but would not give further details of what they were. 
They are understood to have been hedging transactions against Enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment JP. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," added Mr Lay. 
The relationship between the investment losses and the SEC probe is not clear, though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions. 
Enron owns Teesside Power Station and Wessex Water in Britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the US. Investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company's credit rating. 
An Enron spokesman said Mr Fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion. 
The SEC inquiry is "informal", says the company. The watchdog contacted Enron last Wednesday, the day of the results announcement. The SEC declined to comment. 
Enron made a loss of $638m in the third quarter, its first in over four years.

Shares of Enron Plummet 21% Energy: SEC requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive.

Shares of Enron Corp. set a 52-week low Monday on word that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the Houston-based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive. 
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said it had voluntarily provided information on "certain related-party transactions" that had been previously disclosed to the SEC.
"We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive. 
"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest," he said. 
The SEC request is the latest in a parade of bad news for Enron, which has seen investments sour in telecommunications, retail electricity sales and water. 
Investors have battered the company's stock, which once sold for nearly $85 a share in the last year, and many have criticized Enron's stingy meting out of financial information. But several Wall Street analysts remain upbeat on the stock, noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn. 
In August, Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, one of the main architects of the company's strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit, stunned Wall Street by resigning. 
Skilling cited personal, family-related reasons, but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company's stock price contributed to his departure. 
On Monday, Enron shares plunged $5.40, or nearly 21%, to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Enron's stock has lost nearly 40% of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third-quarter loss of $618 million after $1.01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments. 
But the charge also included $35 million related to what Enron described only as the "early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity." 
In a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings, the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions. 
But investors were stunned when stories last week in the Wall Street Journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and that Enron had whittled $1.2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $1.2-billion note it had received from the partnership. Shareholder equity now stands at $9.5 billion. 
The limited partnership, called LJM2, and Fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved Enron assets and stock, the Journal reported. 
Lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed. 
A shareholder lawsuit charging that Enron's directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in Texas state court. 
Many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes, but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them, analyst say. 
Investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that Enron has guarded financial information, making it difficult to analyze the company's complex web of businesses. 
And many are not confident that all the bad news has been released. 
Analyst M. Carol Coale, who follows Enron and other energy companies for Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron to a "hold" from a "buy" rating Monday out of such frustration. 
Coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of Enron. 
But Bob Christensen, energy analyst with First Albany Corp., said that despite Enron's recent difficulties, the bulk of the business remains strong. 
"I continue to tell investors that 70% of this company's business is growing at a 26% rate, and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on," he said. 
Investors are panicking because of a "bad news story that doesn't reflect reality," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with the Raymond James & Associates brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
"They are the world's largest energy trader, and they are very good at that," Cartwright said. 
"The reality is that everything is fine here," although more charges, perhaps $500 million worth, are expected in the next few quarters, related to businesses that Enron is selling.

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=
al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount=
s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea=
r.=20
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=
n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the =
start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=
 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =
in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire=
d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=
 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi=
ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L=
ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, =
he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=
icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=
y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =
insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=
r option exercises.=20
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =
should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=
ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=
vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=
g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =
the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=
old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=
.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=
hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron=
's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=
 company and Mr. Fastow.=20
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=
, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=
 on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=
te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=
nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston=
, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose=
 problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th=
e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s=
uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil=
lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=
 amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =
issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=
 the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=
rop during the past two weeks.=20
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=
 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=
lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=
e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=
rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=
eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=
spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=
e B or lower.=20
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=
 late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=
ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =
investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=
terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=
onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=
cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=
 troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20
"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=
vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=
.J.=20
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=
elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=
- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=
e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=
ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=
cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=
pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=
rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=
 the noninvestment-grade level.=20
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=
le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=
ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=
tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=
g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=
inancial flexibility.)=20
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=
 the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=
tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =
independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed=
 yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=
ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=
ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=
 make good on its commitments.=20
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=
r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =
the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=
y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a=
bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.=
=20
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=
, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi=
es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th=
at credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts=
 to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive=
d from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or c=
ommodity.=20
"Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio=
n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses," s=
aid Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. "Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron=
's counterparties" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree=
ment with Enron -- "is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and l=
ooking for ways to minimize it or offset it," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credi=
t analysts said. "I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a =
company that would ever default," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
"So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are s=
ticking with them," said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's=
 utility energy project finance group. "No one has cut credit lines or aske=
d for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have pub=
licly stated that it's business as usual."=20
Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could =
make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron=

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=
 little about.=20
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic=
s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n=
ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f=
or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=
ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=
ure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=
d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=
ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=
ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =
bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=
ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=
rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =
it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20
"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =
. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =
it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=
ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =
lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20
"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=
 black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =
who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=
ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =
when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=
evel of trust."=20
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=
ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=
 on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.=
=20
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=
ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=
es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=
t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=
ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=
 issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=
y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =
and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=
ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=
e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.=
=20
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=
ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=
 level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=
 stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =
to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=
h not strongly.=20
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=
ll" rating on Enron.=20
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=
es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=
ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=
d.=20
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=
apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=
icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=
es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=
ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=
d other revenue.=20
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=
r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=
on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=
, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20
"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=
 hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=
, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=
ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20
He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=
e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=
vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=
n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=
erformed."=20
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=
 calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=
sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=
ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=
s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=
es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=
lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =
he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=
e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=
s an industry leader.=20
"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=
tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =
their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =
to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=
nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=
 financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron=
's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=
 "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=
d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20
"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=
 prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =
in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =
as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=
k doesn't have much further to fall.=20
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=
, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of=
 research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=
n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=
. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=
 news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=
t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =
analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=
nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=
mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=
 are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=
, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=
der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=
" she says.=20
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she=
 asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not=
 an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=
 of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and E=

In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its=
 lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOn=
line on Thursday was above average levels.=20
Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokes=
woman said.=20
"We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and mo=
re than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our =
commitments in the ordinary course of business," Jeff McMahon, who took ove=
r Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement.=20
Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on =
Thursday.=20
Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: "Enron continues to be=
 the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our custome=

Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's=
 ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as "=
just more negative sentiment."=20
At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, sh=
ares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.=
35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84.=20
Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enro=
n, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a p=
ossible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two=
 steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-t=

Moody's Investors Service put all of Enron's long-term debt on review for p=

Enron, which noted that losing its investment-grade rating would take downg=

Corporate US on track for bailout
DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 1=
8bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app=
roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.=20
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year=
s, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by =
the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amen=
dment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour cor=
porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and=
 Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt "new deal", prefer to see i=
ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects.=20
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on=
 Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn =
to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying l=
ittle or no tax.=20
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative=
 minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid=
 all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be mad=
e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded.=20
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul=
ate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone,=
 while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll=
ars 671m.=20
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's thi=
rd largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United=
 Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy=
 - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced t=
o sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m.=20
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis=
like other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capi=
tal investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They =
say these amount to a "giant corporate giveaway".=20
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h=
elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs=
 and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely t=
o start in the new year.=20
"Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner =
down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of wo=
rking families," the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of Cali=
fornia, said.=20
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's=
 provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Do=
llars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of st=
ates.=20
* A fresh round of global trade talks is essential to revitalise the world =
economy after the terrorist attacks on the US, trade secretary Patricia Hew=
itt said yesterday, writes Charlotte Denny=20
As a new report predicted that global trade growth will collapse this year,=

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?

c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=
 and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =
is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=
ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =
reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=
is predecessor.=20
>From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =
respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=
y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =
doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=
en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt=
's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=
on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=
o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=
 could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =
fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=
estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=
an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=
counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=
mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=
ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=
te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=
. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=
o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=
re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=
n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=
, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=
ments and restatements.''=20
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=
d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=
gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =
a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=
 who try to resist misleading accounting.=20
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =
that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=
tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=
t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=
t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=
g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=
n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=
th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=
.=20
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=
ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=
es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=
ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=
rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=
ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=
ey," he wrote.=20
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =
(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=
 have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=
00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=
d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=
ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=
% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =
UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=
es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=
ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=
ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=
. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=
nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=
me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=
ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=
forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=
 the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=
nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=
haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=
r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=
r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=
perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=
gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=
he federal government.=20
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =
bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =
same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=
nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=
mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =
following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =
Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =
company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =
reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=
vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =
of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=
dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=
ence.=20
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=
nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=
ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =
day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,=
 Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=
ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=20
4. Gold Diggers=20
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=
, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. Accordin=
g to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty preci=
ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, =
with net inflows of $101 million.=20
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, dur=
ing the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion.=
 But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew=
orthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long.=20
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of =
a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=
08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=
mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody=
's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =
period, they were up 7.13%.=20
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades=
 -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =
seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in=
 prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Se=
pt. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will co=
nfront disappointment once again.=20
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become pro=
fitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma oper=
ating profit.=20
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in lon=
g-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit=
 is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningle=
ss aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn a=
n economic profit.=20
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announci=
ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren =
Jenson added the humble qualifier, "There are no guarantees." Amazon simult=
aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that s=
ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago=
.=20
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slig=
htly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core =
books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made p=
rogress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses =
have decreased by 20% over the past year.=20
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made th=
e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% =
from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an=
d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from prev=
ious buy ratings. "We thought there might be upside to our estimates," note=
d Blodget. "There wasn't."=20

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled=
 the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pa=
ir of grim economic reports.=20
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly=
 well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from=
 Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in th=
ird-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversi=
ng an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29,=
 to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99=
.=20
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the=
 fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in re=
cent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good=
 news regarding individual companies.=20
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raise=
d its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarde=
d the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several o=
ther parts of the energy sector along with it.=20
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed =
its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from=
 within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69.=20
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 4=
4 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-s=
torage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54.=20
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measu=
re also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a =
$100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrori=
st attacks on the economy.=20
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily o=
n the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American Int=
ernational Group and WorldCom.=20
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth=
 consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 perc=
ent dip many analysts had forecast.=20
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americ=
ans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, t=
he second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally a=
ssociated with recessions.=20
Other Indicators=20
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the Ame=
rican Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2=

* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where =
trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday.=
 On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and vol=
ume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion.=20
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, =
and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday.=20
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York t=
rading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and =
a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents.=20
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, =
up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20
* Gold for current delivery rose to $277.80 a troy ounce, from $275.90 on W=
ednesday, on the New York Mercantile Exchange's Commodity Exchange.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available=
 bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt=
h and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 bill=
ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi=
ng to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide=
 a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks =
about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the mov=
es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit=
y should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f=
ew days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," sa=
id an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief fin=
ancial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we=
 are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than =
adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme=
nts."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's=
 largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec=
tricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved i=
n about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has report=
ed a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity =
of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di=
d with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch=
, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors chang=
ed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Servic=
e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall =
below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several no=
tches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, E=
nron shares were down six cents at $16.35.=20

As Enron's woes unnerve investors about energy sector, analysts say its pro=
blems are isolated
By BRAD FOSS

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest =
natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto ba=
rometer of health within the energy trading sector.=20
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on=
 the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, execu=
tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and fre=
e-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector.=
 They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolatio=
n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
"The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was =
yesterday, a week ago or a month ago," said Jim Donnell, president of Duke =
Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and tr=
ades power.=20
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In=
c., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday,=
 when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i=
ts rivals.=20
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 p=
ercent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim=
e soon.=20
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning=
s, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n=
ot entirely forthcoming only got worse.=20
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnersh=
ips managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. =
That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off=
 an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow=
, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence.=20
"They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test=
 and they didn't come through with flying colors," said Christopher Ellingh=
aus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York.=20
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have=
 little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts =
for roughly 80 percent of profits.=20
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa=
ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices.=
=20
"Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is sti=
ll sound and not likely to disappear," Ellinghaus said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment.=20
"The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is o=
verdone," Barone said.=20
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income o=
f $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million =
in profits.=20
"It's business as usual," said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.=20
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when =
its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The dow=
nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from =
power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter,=
 taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses,=
 troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earne=
d $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep=
t. 30.=20
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesd=
ay because of "dire" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that=
 it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r=
eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy.=20
"All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality," Ellin=
ghaus said.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.=20
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying clo=
se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o=
f receivables not being paid.=20
"They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to=
 credit," he said. "They've never missed a deadline."

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =

"It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out=

The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Sing=

James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices.=

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=
g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=
e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=
out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the=
 company signed with the state earlier this year.=20
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =
compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=
nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=
ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=
ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =
power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of=
 the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this=
 week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=
o Enron.=20
"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=
sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,=
 Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=
reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=
lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=
le money.=20
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=
te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars=
 of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=
 those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=
an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20
"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=
racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=
o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there=
 are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =
happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=
rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=
ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=
ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=
ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=
t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=
, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=
ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=
ough 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w=
on't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.=20

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp=

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko=
droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=
 United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D=
ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (N=
YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=
f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=
r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =
class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, th=
at acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The P=
rivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume th=
at the class member(s) with the "largest financial interest" in the outcome=
 of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discre=
tion in determining which class member(s) have the "largest financial inter=
est," and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both ab=
solute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained =
substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please cont=

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit t=
o provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion.=20
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has "more than adeq=
uate" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and =
it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain it=
s long-term credit rating.=20
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook f=
or Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in=
 market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair =
plans to rebuild the balance sheet.=20
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative =
news from the company.=20
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.=
35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Averag=
e daily volume is 7,832,606 shares.=20
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, re=
sulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminati=
ng certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed=
 by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediatel=
y.=20

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe En=
ron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock.=20
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks,=
 much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 di=
sclosure of the $1.01 billion charges.=20
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage po=
ints above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3=
 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-gra=
de credit, that kind of "spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with=
 a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said.=20
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downg=
rade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this wee=
k.=20
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have conc=
erns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in poli=
cy concerning the company.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they have=
n't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about =
a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets.=20

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

Release 01255 
AGREEMENT CLEARS HURDLE FOR ALASKA HIGHWAY GASLINE
Knowles Hails Agreement Among Pipeline Partners as Essential Step 
Gov. Tony Knowles hailed today's agreement among six major American energy firms and three Canadian firms as a major step toward development of the Alaska Highway Natural Gas Pipeline project. Foothills Pipeline Company of Calgary announced today the signing of a memorandum of understanding that sets out principles for regrouping the former partnership to eliminate barriers to construction of the Alaska Highway project.

Gov. Knowles made the following comment: 
"Today's announcement by Foothills and other pipeline companies that a major hurdle has been cleared is great news for the Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline project. These major international pipeline companies have now endorsed the pipeline route and are bullish about the project. It's time to get on with the business of advancing a project that's good for Alaska and good for America.

"The oil and gas producers have long said a major impediment to the Alaska Highway project is this so-called 'accrued liability' potentially owed to Foothills and the original partners of the Northwest Pipeline project. Now that that's been resolved, it's time the producers come to the table with pipeline companies, the State of Alaska and other players to get this project underway.

"The Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline will put America to work at a time when the Lower 48 economy is teetering on a recession and when American consumers are demanding affordable, environmentally friendly energy. Alaskans overwhelmingly support this project because it will provide good jobs for Alaskans, affordable energy for our communities and revenues to pay for vital services."

Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms fo=

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain ex=
tremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=
or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=
mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled=
 investors.=20
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=
n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =
more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=
d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=
e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=
e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on=
 Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=
egy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=
ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the "wash =
sale" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =
selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "substantially i=
dentical" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This=
 poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=
ces now make them attractive "buy" candidates.=20
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=
ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=
t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=
ed by the investor.=20
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by "doubling up": buyi=
ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =
the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=
hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=
tional stock.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=
ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=
any, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=
he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=
wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=
ction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According=
 to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=
change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=
ron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =
above $80 a share.=20
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=
ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=
. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=
t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover =
the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading op=
erations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=
egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=
aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=
nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible,"=
 said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=
. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=
ch above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. But Fitch also said it bel=
ieved Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls"=
 in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contrib=
uting to "liquidity pressures."=20
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=
m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=
workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=
eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=
e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=
erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=
ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=
id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said=
 it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=
igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=
ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=
ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=
okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=
ed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.=20

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

11/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sue=
d by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses bec=
ause of Enron's plummeting stock price.=20
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misl=
ed participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing =
in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to r=
emain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosur=
es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company "locked down" the ret=
irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =
prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=
e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on=
 Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=
n costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% o=
f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =
according to one of the suits.=20
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell=
 Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=
y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.=
=20
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=
okeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=
ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it=
 had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed=
 by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=
unched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has =
said it will restate years of financial information.=20
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=
ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=
e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=
ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=
s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=
e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=
stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion=
 of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=
nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=
epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=
n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=
nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's dec=
line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =
their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =
stock was in peril.=20
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=
rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=
on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=
s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the=
 SEC.=20
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=
e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=
ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's =
stock. "I feel like I have been betrayed," Mr. Rinard said in press release=
 issued by his lawyers. "I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=
hing."=20
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=
n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=
ck. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=
ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=
ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=
lly, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=
s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=
t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits=
 over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=
ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LL=
P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies=
 Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=
to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=
on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=
s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that=
 then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite=
 knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=
esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employee=
s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for=
 diversification.=20
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=
r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=
01 billion in the third quarter, Enron "locked down" the 401(k) plan's asse=
ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A "lock-down" occur=
s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =
and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't mak=
e changes in their investment choices).=20
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=
nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =
from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=
f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=
20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=
aid.=20
"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=
ng some really bad news," Mr. Barth said. "Mr. Rinard's looking at having n=
o retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=
ur 50s."

>From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm =
that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities =
and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=
artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=
ent case.=20
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=
thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from=
 the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=
p of the accounting industry?=20
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=
o judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=
re than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and=
 Exchange Commission, said this week.=20
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it=
 is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=
ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=
d.=20
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into=
 trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things we=
re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=
on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=
ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=
ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =
painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing par=
tner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it=
 was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=
king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=
able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to=
 break with clients and push for good rules.=20
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=
ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =
led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=
dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=
d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=
e acted properly.=20
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =
director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=
iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=
pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=
eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even=
 want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=
ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=
.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending=
 clients and not enough to good accounting.=20
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph=
 Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=
t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =
backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =
public of that.

the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =
put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=
ities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=
y dried up for now.=20
Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=
ulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=
r large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=
sis on Wall Street.=20
J. P. Morgan Chase has won some prominent assignments, like handling the re=
vampings of troubled giants like Lucent and, more recently, Enron, the bele=
aguered energy trading company.=20
But while J. P. Morgan Chase is proud of serving alongside Citigroup as bot=
h lead lender and adviser to Enron on its acquisition by Dynegy, the dual r=
ole it has worked to achieve sometimes proves complicated for the bank. Wit=
h Enron's shares in free fall as more information comes out about its hidde=
n debts, J. P. Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =
other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.=
=20
Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fe=
ll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in=
 the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=
an other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like =
Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20
''The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,'' said Judah Kraus=
haar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=
e's stock, he said, because ''expectations are very low.''=20
All J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=
l Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater=
 involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=
rong moneymaker this year.=20
Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=
ontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=
onsumer businesses.=20
''The timing of the merger was bad,'' said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=
t at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=
e shares. ''There's no disputing that.''=20
Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about=
 having done this merger,'' he said in a recent interview. ''While there ar=
e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a=
 much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.''=20
In Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=
e worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=
ots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=
gers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=
re he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up=
 Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's mer=
ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =
last year.=20
The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=
ce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =
leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal=
 maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial offi=
cer.=20
Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =
Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=
king chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail=
 bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =
NationsBank.=20
''There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=
rrison and his team,'' said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=
visors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20
Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =
Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20
''In general, mergers are very hard on morale,'' she said. ''There is no qu=
estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.''=20
The bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=
en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks'=
 staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=
er was announced.=20
Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=
rgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =
have been eliminated by the end of the year.=20
''We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,'' Ms. Dublon said.=20
In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan=
 Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.=
 Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=
bout changes in their jobs. ''People have fewer options,'' he said, ''so yo=
u have a little more control over the process.''=20
Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=
g will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2=
 billion at the time of the merger.=20
The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits=
 in the bank's core businesses. ''What we can control and are managing very=
 aggressively is the expenses of the company,'' Ms. Dublon said in a confer=
ence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20
Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=
k's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees=
 were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=
et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =
Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=
organ Chase will hold on to these gains.=20
The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=
quisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20
The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising=
 on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-plac=
e finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last=
 year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20
The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =
for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=
, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=
ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=
ans.=20
Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, de=
spite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=
lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=
dvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=
r by Dynegy.=20
The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=
ding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.=
 Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =
Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=
d.=20
The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,=
 another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.=
 It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=
ixth place a year ago.=20
The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a=
 surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=
ed $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=
e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20
Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=
grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=
rings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.=
=20
The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=
ck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6t=
h-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20
Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=
ferings to build momentum slowly in that business. ''We think we have a cha=
nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,'' he said.=20
Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =
do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=
er weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20
''The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enou=
gh,'' one investment banker said.=20
Mr. Harrison disagrees: ''I don't feel,'' he said, ''we need to do another =
large deal to be successful.''

Officials working to shore up Enron's balance sheet yesterday said the stru=
ggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than $1.5b=
n as early as next week.=20
Enron is in talks about $250m investments with JP Morgan Chase and Citigrou=
p and is also hoping to raise at least $1bn from private equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish =
to invest in Enron. However, the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be=
 talking to the company before Dynegy made its $9bn rescue bid, is understo=
od no longer to be doing so.=20
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Cit=
igroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt unti=
l after the completion of the merger.=20
The moves comes as reports from Goldman Sachs and Fitch, the credit rating =
agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-term =
viability.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were in=
adequate to meet $2.8bn of debt obligations falling due before the end of t=
he year.=20
People close to Enron say that nearly $1bn of that debt has already been re=
structured.=20
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed, Enron woul=
d struggle to meet $9bn of obligations due before the end of next year.=20
People close to Enron insisted that Dynegy remained committed to the merger=
 and played down talk of renegotiation.=20
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the de=

USA: UPDATE 2-Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow.

By C. Bryson Hull
HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - A long weekend of work faced Dynegy Inc. and pr=
oposed acquisition Enron Corp.,, whose worsening stock woes on Friday whipp=
ed up fear that the deal could be renegotiated or collapse entirely.=20
Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holid=
ay weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival Enron's complex books, as both=
 parties race against the decline in Enron's stock to complete the thorough=
 financial examinations a merger requires.=20
Enron shares ended down more than 5 percent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the c=
lose of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy s=
hares closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 percent, to $40.40.=20
Dynegy on Nov. 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, af=
ter falling 45 percent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out of cas=
h before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about $4.03=
 billion.=20
At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is worth about $10.85 =
a share - more than twice Enron's current share price.=20
Executives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the =
review, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter told Reute=
rs. The sources said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday aft=
ernoon, and that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence r=
eview is finished.=20
But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as a "mate=
rial adverse change" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases of Dyneg=
y invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers say.=20
"You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 percent spr=
ead on the deal," said one analyst. "There's unquestionably continued malai=
se in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate =
with Enron."=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a research report that=
 the likelihood was "soaring" that Dynegy might discover a material adverse=
 change.=20
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her knowledge, Dynegy was not r=
enegotiating the terms of the acquisition.=20
She repeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million=
 to $1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet=
.=20
Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the =
company remains optimistic about the merger.=20
TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION=20
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the c=
rown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarte=
r earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its p=
rofitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dyne=
gy.=20
Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more li=
kely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a move the=
y said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy.=
=20
This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped away fr=
om the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy f=
iling was highly possible.=20
Traders, speaking on condition on anonymity, said they expected Dynegy to s=
cramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap. Enron's dep=
leted market value and the shrinking volume in its EnronOnline trading syst=
em makes it more likely Dynegy could pull out, traders said.=20
Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-ter=
m deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company'=
s credit rating would soon improve.=20
Enron's bonds on Friday were again talked at junk-bond levels, but even low=
er than before.=20
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 percent notes were =
bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cent=
s on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respec=
tive 21.5 percent and 17 percent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds=
 fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents.=20
Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit =
trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers won=
der how Enron has avoided it.=20
"A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade secur=

USA: Enron avoids junk status, but observers wonder how.
By Jonathan Stempel

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - It is rare that holding onto investment-grade =
credit ratings means as much to a company as it does now to beleaguered ene=
rgy trader Enron Corp. , and some observers are wondering why a cut to junk=
 status is taking so long.=20
"The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds," =
said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco,=
 where he invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. "A bond tradi=
ng in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security."
Enron's 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 percent notes were bid =
Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on=
 Wednesday, a trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 percent and 17 =
percent.=20
Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 percent this year. Since October 16,=
 when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downwar=
d, its shares have fallen 86 percent, and its bonds by nearly half.=20
Houston-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival=
 Dynegy Inc. , has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings r=
estatements, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle.=20
Its advisers were expected this weekend to pore over the company's books, w=
hich could lead to a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the=
 matter said.=20
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecur=
ed debt ratings twice in the last month to their current "Baa3" and "BBB-mi=
nus," their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating t=
o "BBB-minus," and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts.=20
The stakes could hardly be higher.=20
CASH CRUNCH=20
A downgrade to "junk" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force =
it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, =
and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said.=20
Enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of a=
vailable cash and credit lines.=20
S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces "liquidity issues," but enjoys an "ali=
gnment of interests" with its banks and a near-term financial position that=
 "is expected to be sufficient" to allow the Dynegy merger.=20
Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that "our present 'BBB-minus' rating re=
sts on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks."=
=20
If Dynegy walks away, it said, "Enron's credit situation seems untenable wi=
th a bankruptcy filing highly possible."=20
Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next y=
ear, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later sai=
d it got a three-week reprieve.=20
INVESTMENT BANKS=20
Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. in Philadelphia, lik=
ened Enron's ratings situation to those of California's two largest utiliti=
es, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison .=20
Despite investor unease, those utilities kept their investment-grade rating=
s only until they defaulted on debt in January, as California's power crisi=
s worsened.=20
On November 8, a day before the Dynegy merger was announced, senior officia=
ls from Enron's lead banks - William Harrison, chief executive of J.P. Morg=
an Chase & Co. , and Michael Carpenter, who runs Citigroup Inc.'s investmen=
t banking arm - met with Moody's to help allay that agency's concerns, a pe=
rson familiar with the meeting said.=20
A day later, Moody's, which issued no statement on Enron this week, downgra=
ded the company's senior unsecured debt rating, but only to its current "Ba=
a3."=20
"Pressure is coming from the investment banks, which have a vested interest=
 in seeing the Dynegy deal go through," said Egan, whose agency rates Enron=
's debt "BB," its second-highest junk grade. "Investment banking fees will =
be substantial."=20
Companies pay for Moody's and S&P ratings, which they need to obtain financ=
ing. Egan said his agency receives no such payments.=20
Citigroup and J.P. Morgan declined to comment. Moody's and S&P did not imme=
diately return phone calls. Fitch was not immediately available for comment=

Wells Capital's Smith isn't sure what to expect.=20
"Enron will remain definitively investment grade if the merger as billed go=

USA: Enron shares seesaw on concerns over Dynegy deal.

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. fluctuated wildly on Fri=
day morning, as concerns grew over rival Dynegy Inc.'s $9 billion acquisiti=
on of the beleaguered energy trader.=20
Enron shares were down 8 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $4.93 in Friday morning =
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after diving more than 8 percent ea=
rlier.
The shares are down because of talk that the terms of Dynegy's deal with En=
ron could be changed or that the deal could collapse.=20
Dynegy originally agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, a=
fter falling 42 percent since then by Wednesday's close, Enron now sports a=
 market capitalization of only about $4.26 billion.=20
In a report on Wednesday, Ronald Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg, suggest=
ed that the deal's current exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of Dynegy for eac=
h share of Enron could well be readjusted.=20
He suggested that a much lower exchange ratio of 0.15 was more realistic.=

Some of Enron's trading partners have scaled back their activity, causing t=

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more=
 wrong.=20
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting "the per=
fect storm" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy t=
rading business one to watch in 2001.
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and=
 fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That wa=
s followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =
were headed down, not up.=20
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the=
 industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=
as prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=
cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =
where traditional utilities trade.=20
And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=
illing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =
price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is current=
ly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of =
time before the stocks get there.=20
"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the=
 governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of a=
rtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=
tate's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron."=20
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =
demand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20
"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he sai=
d. "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=
ility."=20
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=
ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategie=
s and financial disclosures.=20
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=
ting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the =
fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention=
 paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=
y it can create.=20
Answers Elude Investors=20

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=
y want.=20
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of=
 a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =
at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=
riod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=
om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=
riginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair val=
ue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =
the market for the commodity isn't liquid.=20
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=
ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=
rts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=
atterson.=20
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=
or added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=
ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their=
 mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =
compared with those in the second quarter.=20
Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20
"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=
lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=
hem than earnings that do not," he said.=20
He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=
nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market=
 accounting.=20
At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =
being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=
nages a pension fund.=20
Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =
energy merchants produce.=20
Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=
erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=
ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=
onal utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the=
 growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity p=
rices.=20
Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy C=
orp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D).=20
According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earning=
s multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the st=
ocks.=20
"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclic=
al these companies are," O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple sho=
uld be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.=20
As for independent power producers - which are companies without regulated =
operations that own power plants to generate electricity to sell and trade =
in the wholesale market - the group may wind up being valued on the basis o=
f the replacement costs of the assets in their portfolio, according to O'Br=
ien.=20
"One analogy is that they are basically like commercial real-estate plays,"=
 O'Brien said.=20
That could mean stocks such as Calpine Corp. (CPN), which is already in the=
 lower-half of its trading range, may have further to fall.=20

U.S. Energy Exhange May Scrap Online Platform Plans
By Stephen Parker
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The world's largest energy futures exchange is takin=
g a second look at plans to launch a major new electronic trading platform =
known as eNymex, and may decide to scrap them.=20
Management changes at the New York Mercantile Exchange, along with the succ=
ess of Access, an online platform the exchange expanded in September, have =
prompted the move.
Nymex may decide to combine parts of eNymex with Access, according to sourc=
es close to the matter. It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth=
er exchanges, and considering developing "e-mini" contracts - smaller energ=
y contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors.=20
"There's new management in place at the exchange," said Nymex spokeswoman N=
achamah Jacobovits. "They're rethinking all of our business strategies, and=
 one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-=
to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products."=20
Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on buil=
ding the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work=
 on the project.=20
Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back e=
nd of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project aft=
er GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is "subs=
tantially complete, but the company can't speak to Nymex's overall electron=
ic-trading strategy," a Kiodex source said.=20
The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=
nergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=
me of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=
ed in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=
ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.=
=20
"We've expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract," Jacobovi=
ts said. "Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=
form, which is a factor in that decision."=20
Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=
er the day's Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with=
 dedicated phone systems.=20
The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =
so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=
ding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =
trade to more users.=20
The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=
1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex's building, located near where th=
e trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=
anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=
tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading=
 hours after Nymex reopened.=20
Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=
mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =
the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=
ert "Bo" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =
of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=
pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=
uct line.=20
If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=
x with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20
"eNymex right now is looking for a new mission," said an industry source cl=
ose to Nymex. "You know how politics works. We don't scrap it, we just rena=
me it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =
the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done."=20
Nymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=
hange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=
p.'s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=
heir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20
Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =
and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=
es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=
on's possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=
d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.=
=20
Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=
nron's troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=
ring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=
ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20
ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=
rade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the=
 London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex's chief competitor a=
nd Europe's largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=
nergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=
r some over-the-counter contracts.=20
Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new=
 competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=
hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =
CME's Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20
Nymex officials wouldn't confirm whether they're talking with the CME, but =
they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20
"Nymex is always open to strategic alliances," Jacobovits said. "There's no=
thing we've agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=
r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship =
with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them.=
"=20
Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme=
x trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o=
n its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.=20

STOCKWATCH Enron down, Dynegy up on lingering merger uncertainty

NEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp shares were lower, while Dynegy Inc was slightl=

At 11.15 am, Enron shares were trading down 17 cents at 4.84, a decline of =
3.3 pct. Dynegy was up 44 cents at 40.20.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at=
 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99=20
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal quoted an unnamed source as saying Monday'=

osed buyer Dynegy.=20
Dynegy representatives are planning to work through the weekend evaluating =
the significance of this information as part of their due diligence on Enro=
n, the paper said. It did not specify the nature of the information.=20
In the filing, Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including =
a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27.=20
On Wednesday, the company said it had received an extension on the repaymen=
t until mid-December, which it said was enough time to restructure the debt=
.=20
The company also said it was in active talks with its creditors and expecte=
d to be able to restructure other debt and remain solvent long enough for t=

Dynegy welcomed the news and said it will push ahead in seeking regulatory =
approval for the merger. But investors are concerned that the constant surp=
rises in restated earnings and revelations of liquidity problems at Enron m=
ay cause Dynegy to walk away from the deal.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone lowered Enron's fourth-quarter earnings p=
er share estimate to a loss of 25 cents from earnings of 25 cents, arguing =
that its business will suffer until its liquidity problems are resolved.=20
The analyst cut his full year estimate to 1.10 usd from 1.60 usd and 2002 e=

"We reiterate that if the merger with Dynegy were to run into obstacles (or=

such a scenario, bankruptcy would not be out of the question."=20
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer was more upbeat, and said th=

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and dive=
rse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of t=
he city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., econ=
omists and analysts said.=20
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and i=
s in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third m=
ajor employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent m=
onths. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attack=
s and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if fina=
lized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced=
 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.=20
"It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co=
ntinental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in th=
e grand scope of the Houston economy," said Phil Scheps, director of Housto=
n's finance and administration department.=20
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co=
mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energ=
y giant's market share has steadily eroded.=20
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l=
ayoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for =
Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs "will b=
e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."=20
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's ef=
forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu=
e collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. "We're =
watching to see where things go now," she said.=20
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't=
 concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. "While Enron is c=
ertainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what th=
e impact would be."=20
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdow=
n since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nati=
on.=20
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the T=
exas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax =
base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.=20
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the in=
itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit=
y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent.=
 That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 bi=
llion budget.=20
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small cha=
nge in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are =
based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very larg=
e, Scheps said.=20
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence h=
as quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenu=
e collections will be available in February when the city receives data for=
 the December holiday season, Scheps said.

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is=
 coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=
ibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (E=
NE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-tradin=
g company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. Du=
ring the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revi=
sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billio=
n reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=
erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=
rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=
ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=
ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=
han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =
shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =
In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =
volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=
y lower, market observers said.=20
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=
ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=
gy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=
ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =
approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously=
 announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=
on.=20
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk=
 away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=
nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=
called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=
is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=
omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=
., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a=
 drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,=
 two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=
ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=
on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =
planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=
nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=
ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685=
 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving=
 the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =
However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =
Dynegy.=20
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=
8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =
of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula=
 price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=
nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=
ding relatively close to the offering price.=20
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=
itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =
and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=
ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,=
 would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director=
 at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=
blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than=
 Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"=
 is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15=
 Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20

Employees' Lawuit Says Enron Hurt Retirement Funds Courts: The suit claims =
the energy firm urged workers to invest in company stock just before it plu=

HOUSTON -- Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endan=
gered their retirement funds.=20
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Houston under the Employee Retiremen=
t Income Security Act, asserts that Enron encouraged the employees to inves=
t more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit w=
as filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker Steve =
Lacey.
Enron shares have plunged more than 90% over the last several months since =
the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controvers=
y that prompted the firm to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating mo=
re than $580 million of reported income.=20
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle=
, said Enron touted the value of its shares and encouraged employees to put=
 their entire portfolio into Enron stock.=20
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation=
 as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berm=
an, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class action.=20
Berman wants to prove that the company's 401(k) plan executives failed to a=
ct responsibly when they knew about serious business problems. He's also ho=
ping to break new legal ground with his case.=20
The lawsuit is patterned after a case against Lucent Technologies in which =
Lucent employees sued their employer this summer for matching their 401(k) =
contributions with company stock that tanked. That case is still in litigat=
ion.=20
Earlier this year, Rinard, 54, had $472,000 in his Enron 401(k) plan, which=
 had been growing for 21 years.=20
Today, his plan is worth about $40,000. Enron gives its employees their 401=
(k) match in company stock.=20
In January, Enron was trading for $84.87. Wednesday it closed at $5.01 a sh=
are on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
The problem was compounded when many employees, including Rinard, saw Enron=

Portland utility's fate tied to Enron's future

LOS ANGELES -- Oregon's largest utility, Portland General Electric, faces a=
n uncertain future as its parent Enron fights for its life amid a deepening=
 financial crisis, industry experts said Wednesday.=20
Another Oregon utility, Northwest Natural Gas, is due to file next week wit=
h state regulators for approval to take over Portland General. Those same r=
egulators could soon be faced with a similar application from Dynegy as par=
t of a still-pending deal to acquire cash-strapped Enron.
If Enron were to file for bankruptcy before Portland General has been sold,=
 its future could be thrown into the hands of a Texas bankruptcy court, exp=
erts said.=20
Northwest Natural Gas agreed Oct. 8 to acquire Portland General for around =
$1.8 billion, plus about $1.1 billion in assumed debt and preferred stock. =
A month later, Enron announced it had agreed to be acquired by Houston-base=
d Dynegy.=20
"We've been watching this from afar to see how it could impact that sale (P=
ortland General's acquisition by Northwest Natural Gas)," said Roy Hemmingw=
ay, chairman of the Oregon Public Utility Commission.=20
"We have authority if that sale doesn't go through to rule on whether Dyneg=
y can take over Enron," he said.=20
Ratings agency Fitch last week cut Portland General's debt ratings due to "=
uncertainty at its parent Enron." Wednesday, the same agency said a bankrup=
tcy filing by Enron was "highly possible" if the proposed rescue by Dynegy =
collapses.=20
"We haven't seen any credit problems so far, and Portland General isn't in =
the market (buying power for its customers) right now in a big way," Hemmin=

However, he noted that, "If they really were unable to conduct their busine=

Federal regulators have insisted the sellers of wholesale power have the ri=

California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, chose to file for ban=

Hemmingway said the Oregon Public Utility Commission recently had granted P=

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)
2001-11-23 15:55 (New York)

Enron Shares and Bonds Fall on Concern About Takeover (Update5)

     (Updates with Dynegy comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds
fell for a third day on concern the company's weakened financial
condition and plunging stock price may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to
cancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader.

     Shares of Enron, the most-active U.S. stock, dropped
30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.71. They fell 45 percent Tuesday and
Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than $9 billion
in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4 percent bonds due in July 2006 were
bid at 55 cents on the dollar, down from 62 cents on Wednesday,
traders said.

     Enron shares are trading at less than half the value of
Dynegy's offer, which shows investors are questioning whether the
buyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago.
Enron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on Dynegy's earnings
next year if the transaction is completed, analysts said.

     ``There are continued doubts about the deal,'' said UBS
Warburg analyst Ronald Barone, who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy''
and doesn't own shares in either company. ``Enron's earnings
aren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business.
Given that, Dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price.''

     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company ``remains
optimistic for the potential of the merger.'' Enron agreed Nov. 9
to the takeover, now valued at about $23 billion in stock and
assumed debt, after a financial crisis threatened it with
bankruptcy.

     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders on
a $690 million note due next week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck
Watson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend the
note payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million credit
facility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.

     More than 40 million Enron shares changed hands today, almost
twice their three-month daily average, in a session shortened
because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Enron was the most-active
U.S. stock on Wednesday, with 116 million shares traded. Dynegy
shares rose 64 cents to $40.40 today.

                       Less Than $2 Billion

     In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Monday, Enron
said it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. If
the company's cash reserves run too low, Enron is in danger of
seeing its credit rating cut below investment grade. That would
trigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliated
partnerships.

     Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in
a bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injection
of as much as $2 billion, the New York Times reported yesterday,
citing unidentified executives close to the companies.

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking
$500 million to $1 billion. Enron needs to raise $1 billion to
$1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days, said Sean Egan,
managing director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.

     ``Their trading operation has burned through cash faster than
the market had expected,'' Egan said.

                         Trading Business

     Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said they
shifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stock
price prompted concerns about creditworthiness. Enron has said
fourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in its
energy-trading business.

     Watson said after the Enron buyout was announced he expected
it to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent. Analysts said that
can't happen unless Enron recovers lost trading business. Several
have cut their 2002 estimates for Enron. The average estimate of
analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call for next year is
now $1.68 a share, down from $2.14 a month ago.

     Dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if Enron can't meet debt
payments, its trading market collapses, banks demand more
collateral or raise the interest rate for loans, Enron's credit
rating is cut to junk, the SEC cites Enron for securities fraud,
or if Enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed
$3.5 billion, Egan said.


                     Will Dynegy Renegotiate?

     Dynegy officials were considering whether to try and
renegotiate terms of its agreement with Enron, according to the
New York Times report. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.

     ``Dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate a
lower price for Enron,'' said Credit Lyonnais securities analyst
Gordon Howald, who rates Dynegy ``buy'' and owns no shares.

     Under the Nov. 9 terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy share for each share held. At today's closing price, that
values Enron stock at $10.85. A year ago, Enron traded at almost
$80.

     Investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would push
Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``The market is saying there seems to be no obvious Plan B
for Enron and that is what has investors concerned,'' said Eric
Bergson, who helps manage $9 billion of fixed-income assets at
Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The lower bond prices go, what
the market is saying is that there's less chance of this deal
going through.''

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says
2001-11-23 16:20 (New York)

KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says

     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &
Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among the
likely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp. for a private
equity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet, said
industry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.

     The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energy
companies in the past. An investment in Enron may look attractive
now that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year.

     ``Many of the larger, more traditional buyout firms would
find this deal attractive,'' said Snow. ``This is a company that
has real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capital
when capital is scarce.''

     Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and
two industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Times
reported, citing executives close to the companies. Enron's stock
fell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to cancel or
rework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company.

     Investors may inject as much as $2 billion under arrangements
that would protect them from further declines in Enron's stock,
the Times said. The new investments would be in Enron's
Transwestern Pipeline, which connects natural-gas fields in Texas
to the California market, the newspaper said.

     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to terms
that give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of a
transaction to be completed Monday, officials told the newspaper.

     Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids, pooling their
money and distributing the risk. The firms also like to invest in
industries that are out of favor with public investors and to do
so in partnership with corporate investors, like Dynegy, said
Snow.

     ``You need to know enough about the (energy) business to know
whether it's a good deal, and then you need to be confident in the
Dynegy team,'' he said.

                                KKR

     KKR, the second-biggest private equity firm with $24 billion
in assets, declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman Molly
Morse of Kekst & Co.

     The New York-based firm invested more than $1.3 billion in
DPL Inc., a utility in Dayton, Ohio, and will receive $550 million
of that back from the company after DPL sold $700 million of bonds
in August.

     ``KKR very much gets involved in deals where there's a
corporate partner and they don't have a majority stake,'' Snow
said. ``They would possibly hold it for years, because they like
slow exits.'' KKR is also a possible candidate because it recently
raised a new $5 billion buyout fund.

     Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get its
money back on an Enron investment, said Snow.

     ``The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit,'' he
said. ``If there's a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out (the LBO
firms') stake over time, that would give some confidence. But if
the only exit is the public market, that's a little bit dicier.''

     Any private investment also must be large enough to make a
meaningful difference: Enron's market value is $3.7 billion and
Dynegy has proposed paying $23 billion in stock and assumption of
debt. That means the private equity portion would have to approach
$1 billion or more.

     The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than
$5 billion under management each, according to Asset Alternatives,
a Wellesley, Massachusetts industry research firm. Still, many of
those firms don't have enough free capital to undertake an
investment of $500 million or more.

     An announcement of an investment may come soon, analysts say.
Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. are
doing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the company
won't be able to finance its business. Enron shares have fallen by
almost half in the past three sessions.

     ``They're going to need this investment within 30 to 45
days,'' said Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``They're
spiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the
$1.5 billion contributed by'' ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy.

                            Other LBOs

     Here's a rundown of the other most likely private equity
partners for Enron:

     --The Carlyle Group could invest through a $1 billion energy
fund it's raising, as well as its general U.S. buyout fund, said
Snow. Carlyle's vice president for corporate communications, Chris
Ullman, declined to comment.

     --Blackstone, which has a history of investing alongside
other corporate partners, recently closed on a $4 billion buyout
fund. Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment on
whether Enron had approached the firm.

     --Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which is based in Texas like
Dynegy and Enron. Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd., an energy
exploration company, among its best investments. The firm recently
raised about $1.5 billion for new investments, about one-third of
what it had hoped to raise, and has said it will focus on ``back-
to-basics'' investments in food, manufacturing and media. Mark
Semer, a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst,
declined comment on Enron.

     Spokesmen for two other firms, Warburg Pincus & Co. and
Credit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm, didn't return
calls seeking comment.

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit
2001-11-23 11:59 (New York)

Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit

     Redmond, Washington Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.'s
plans to expand its MSN high-speed Internet service have been
delayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp., which could cost the
company customers during the holiday season, analysts said.

     MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephone
lines available, with help from energy trader Enron, in 45 markets
starting Oct. 25. Instead, the service is now on sale in about 30
markets, said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry.

     The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck that
has delayed the rollout of Microsoft's fast Internet access
service over the last year. The holidays are typically a popular
time for customers to buy so-called broadband access, often along
with new personal computers purchased or received as gifts.

     ``They have a track record of picking broadband partners that
don't quite work out,'' said Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at market
researcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc. ``It definitely hurts them
with customers who want broadband right now.''

     Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected to
grow fourfold by 2006, according to estimates by Jupiter Media
Metrix, while sales of slower Internet access plans decline. Fast
Internet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line, or
DSL, technology.

                         On Track

     Gurry said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is still on
track to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90
percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSL
available in their neighborhoods.

     ``There is very little growth left in the dial-up access
space for Microsoft or anybody, which leaves them with broadband
as the only potential growth area for the MSN access business,''
said Youssef Squali, an analyst at FAC/Equities, who rates
Microsoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc. a ``buy.''

     Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like music
and video and software updates, which require fast Internet access
for smooth downloads.

     The company originally began a service with NorthPoint
Communications Group Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of fast Web
access. Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners among
cable companies who use their networks for high-speed service.

     Now Houston-based Enron, which agreed in June to provide the
backbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN's service, is suing.
Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliver
broadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing
and ordering system that the biggest software company agreed to
build.

     Enron, which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., recently
disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003 and restated earnings
for four years.

                        Slower Expansion

     MSN has been selling high-speed access in 14 states under
partnership with Qwest Communications International Inc. for the
last few months. MSN has begun the planned service expansion
outside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSN
Marketing Director Bob Visse declined to name. The company is also
talking to Enron, he said. Enron didn't return calls for comment.

     Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower than
expected, Visse said. Since Oct. 25, MSN has added service in Los
Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, California, and
Houston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, giving Microsoft a
total of about 30 markets rather than 45. Plans to expand
marketing are also on hold, Visse said.

     ``It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we are
in,'' said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.

     Top U.S. Internet service provider America Online, owned by
AOL Time Warner Inc., has also been slow to get into the high-
speed market, analysts said.

     That doesn't mean Microsoft is in the clear. Laszlo said both
MSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with tougher
competition from third-place EarthLink Inc. and from cable and
telephone companies that have more experience selling high-speed
Internet access.

     America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN's
7 million. EarthLink Inc. has 4.77 million subscribers. Laszlo
doesn't think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead in
the high-speed market that America Online has in the slower dial-
up access market.

                       `Not a Permanent Blow'

     Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft. MSN will be able
to expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays,
Laszlo said.

     ``They are already late in the broadband market so this means
they get a little later,'' he said. ``But broadband will continue
to grow over the next few years and this is definitely not a
permanent blow.''

     Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cable
partner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access over
cable lines. Cable is more popular than DSL with customers looking
for fast Web service. The five largest cable providers control 51
percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. The five largest
sellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account for
about 33 percent, according to market researcher ARS Inc.

     Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month the
company may be interested in an investment in AT&T Corp.'s cable-
television unit, which AT&T is considering selling. Ballmer
declined to comment on Microsoft's plans.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Danny, we polled the three pipes and they made no change from the November 16th Forecast.  We did publish the Weekly (which will be viewable on November 23rd on the Website) just repeating the same Forecast.  Have a good holiday!

As you all know, we are in the process of developing the necessary materials for the TW and NNG credit rating reviews with the Rating Agencies.  Since everyone has been severely impacted by the drop in the TW and NNG credit ratings, it is absolutely critical that we quickly pull together a very comprehensive package that describes TW / NNG's financial position, regulatory environment, competitive position, and operations.  This will require input from all of you.  Before we all get away for the holidays, I would like to schedule a 1 hour meeting either tomorrow afternoon or Friday to discuss (i) materials needed, (ii) process, and (iii) timing.  The importance of returning to an investment grade level during 2002 will be a very long and difficult process.  The sooner we get started, the better chance we have.

My assistant Terri Bachand (x36528) will coordinate the meeting.

Thanks,

Kevin

Janet / Danny,

We do have Rafael on our radar screen as a loan program participant.  

Ted and Traci have been visiting with him, and plan to talk to him when he comes to Houston in November.  FYI - he wants to return to Enron as a Manager, not an Associate.  Additional background - he was an Analyst for a year in London, was promoted to Associate and went back to Columbia for his MBA two years later.

I don't know the individual, but given 2 years as an Associate - he may be a Manager candidate.  His visits with the business units in November should prove it out.   

Regards,
Billy

Janet,
       I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time.  He's at Columbia on an Enron loan through the Associate Pool.  He worked for Eric Gonzales in Spain and for me in EES Europe.  He's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands.

Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Rafael Rizo-Patron

Hi Julie.

I've just sent out the confirmation and dialing instructions for tomorrow's call.    Dennis is aware that Danny can participate for a brief 15 min. and that Eric will cover.   Thanks for your response.   If Danny feels the need to touch base with Dennis separately, let me know and we'll find time.

The new date to sign is 10/31.  Ballentine told me he has his earnest money ready and his client is ready to go.  Ballentine is mulling over the tax language we recently added.  I'm confident the deal will happen.

We could do the deal with Ballentine and then sell our ROFR rights to Mr. Babiuk.  The rights expire in twelve months, but they could be worth $100,000 or so.

I'll continue dealing with Ballentine unless I hear otherwise from you.

Danny,

Julie has me on your schedule Monday 10/22 at 1:30pm to sign the attached agreement.  I will bring you two copies with legal sign off and with Ballentine's signature.  Here are the terms:

All shares of Enron Alligator Alley Pipeline Company will be sold to ID3Energy Company, which is Ballentine's company
Price is $1,000,000
ID3 puts up $50,000 earnest money 
ID3 takes assets as-is, where-is
ID3 will complete, at their expense, the environmental remediation work plan within twelve months
Enron has right to match any bona fide offer to construct liquid or gas pipelines in the right-of-way for a twelve month period
Enron will negotiate an operating agreement to provide ID3 with field services for no longer than six months
Close in 90 days

We would like to have this executed on Monday 10/22.  If you don't think that's possible, please advise and Julie can reschedule.

Thanks,
John

Janet,
       I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time.  He's at Columbia on an Enron loan through the Associate Pool.  He worked for Eric Gonzales in Spain and for me in EES Europe.  He's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands.

Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Rafael Rizo-Patron

I thought you'd get a chuckle out of the email below -- especially the part where he copied Stan.

This is some unsolicited feedback I received on the presentation I gave to Phil's staff.  I'm not quite sure what to make of the fact that he was "sold" on my seriousness.  Evidentally there was some issue......

Shelley . . . 

Looking over my notes from the Operations Directors Conference, I am reminded of what a fine job you did delivering your presentation and I thought I'd provide you this feedback.

I felt you clearly conveyed your information in a manner that engaged the participants and helped them understand and retain your message.  Specifically, you organized your presentation in a logical sequence, you spoke distinctly with varying voice inflection and without "umms" (a very difficult thing to do!), and you related well to your audience through a friendly tone in your voice and in your body language (smiles, eye contact and open posture).  Watching and listening, I both "liked" you and felt "sold" on the seriousness of you and your group in executing the duties of your function and providing effective customer service.

To improve the effectiveness of your slide show, you might consider reducing the number of bullets in some slides.  As a general rule, slides become "busy" and impact the receiver's comprehension when the number of bullets gets past about six; so, I suggest that you limit the number of bullets in any one slide to 5 or 6 and break up a list any longer than that into two or more slides.  This will make your audience more comfortable and enhance their retention.

Thanks for the effort and energy you put into your session.  I learned helpful new things about gas logistics and enjoyed your presentation.  You were very effective.

Regards,
- Roger

Copy:  Stan Horton
(Note to Stan - I had to step out while you were speaking; so, please don't expect this level of feedback on your presentation, though I'm sure it went just as well!)

Danny

I believe John Millar works for Eric Gadd in Business Development. If my sources are correct, John is a former EOTT employee. We are looking to possibly use John, if he available, in a special and critical role regarding EOTT pipeline integrity. This would likely be at least a six month, and maybe a year long effort.

Give me a call.

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan

	Phil / Danny,
		As you may or may not know, I am in the process of selling Enron's interest in our joint venture in Korea. We have a formal bid procedure underway, assisted by Goldman Sachs. Preliminary bids were received last Thursday , and final bids are due on January 7th. 
		I was reviewing the results of the preliminary bid submissions with Stan and Jim Hughes on Friday , when Stan suggested I contact you. With final bids due on January 7th, my target is to close and fund the sale by the end of January. When the sale closes, Enron will be out of Korea and no longer need my services here. As a bit of background, about one year ago , I needed to get my daughter back into the United States for medical and educational reasons ,so I repatriated my family to Orlando , Florida. At that time ,I (or anyone else) could have forecast the events that have taken place within Enron.
		Stan thought there might be something for me to do in Maitland , and I told him I would be interested in that or Houston for that matter. I had to leave Houston on Saturday to get back here, but I would like to give you a call to see if there is anything I could do in your organization.

What is the REAL threat to the gas  infrastructure?  Do we understand  what companies are trying to protect against?
How to effectively evaluate your current system  security.
Proactive steps in creating alliances with homeland  security, law enforcement and trade associations
Our 'new normal' will not be like the last?but what is  the proper level of awareness we should have?  Should we look to foreign companies as  our 'new normal' what may already be their standard operating  procedures?
We may need to sacrifice "convenience" for the benefit  of better security, but what does that mean?  
To increase security we will need to share less system  information as widely?what information should we begin to hold more  closely?

 The broadcast will be aired in three segments.  Each segment will follow the  model:

Enron Discusses Credit Line of $1 Billion to $2 Billion With Banks

Enron Corp., scrambling to restore confidence in its finances, is negotiati=
ng with banks for a new credit line of between $1 billion and $2 billion, a=
nd is likely to close a deal within days, according to officials familiar w=
ith the matter.=20
The new credit line is intended to bolster Enron's financial condition and =
head off a potentially devastating loss of investor and business confidence=
. The new credit would supplement existing lines, which are largely tapped =
out after Enron last week drew down about $3 billion to increase cash reser=
ves and calm fears in the stock, bond and energy markets.
An Enron spokesman confirmed that the company is negotiating a new credit l=
ine, but said he couldn't supply any further details.=20
Houston-based Enron is the nation's biggest energy trader and a principal i=
n nearly one-quarter of all electricity and natural-gas trades. Once a favo=
rite of Wall Street, the company now is in the unfamiliar position of convi=
ncing a deeply concerned investment community that, despite difficulties, i=
ts finances remain sound.=20
Confidence in Enron's financial situation was shaken after Enron earlier th=
is month announced a $618 million third-quarter loss and disclosed a $1.2 b=
illion erosion of shareholder equity related to controversial transactions =
it had done with entities connected to its then-chief financial officer, An=
drew Fastow.=20
Last week, Enron replaced Mr. Fastow and said that the Securities and Excha=
nge Commission was looking into the transactions. The company has consisten=
tly said that the transactions were proper and legal.=20
Enron's stock price fell again Friday. As of 4 p.m., in composite trading o=
n the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were down 95 cents at $15.40. E=
nron shares have fallen 50% in the past two weeks and are down 83% from a S=
ept. 18, 2000, high of $89.63.=20
Late last week, Enron tapped its existing credit lines, with part of that m=
oney being used to redeem nearly $2 billion of its outstanding commercial p=
aper, or short-term corporate IOUs. Ron Barone of credit-rating agency Stan=
dard & Poor's said he believes that Enron was "getting a bit more resistanc=
e" recently in rolling over its commercial paper as it came due. Thus, Enro=
n probably decided it would be easier simply to redeem the paper outstandin=
g, he said.=20
The Enron spokesman yesterday said that paying off the commercial paper and=
 still leaving the company with an additional roughly $1 billion cash on ha=
nd would give it more financial flexibility.=20
Also last week, credit-rating agencies warned investors they were reviewing=
 Enron's debt and commercial-paper ratings for a possible downgrade. A lowe=
r rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20
Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c=
onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last =
week could impair "Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital mark=
ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."=20
The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are =
doing business with Enron on "essentially the same terms" as they have in t=
he past. "There has been no significant change in the credit conditions," h=
e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron =
would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's f=
inances.=20
The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase=
 & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n=
ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20
Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to=
 show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. "Confid=
ence in this company was lost," said one bank official involved in the nego=
tiations for a new credit line. "But confidence will be restored."=20
Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demons=
trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a=
ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.=
 Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu=
strates the pressure Enron is feeling.

Manager's Journal: How Enron Ran Out of Gas
By Paul Kedrosky

10/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A22
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Is troubled Enron Corp. the Long Term Capital Management of the energy mark=
ets, or merely yet another mismanaged company whose executives read too man=
y of their own press releases? Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a=
re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele=
ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20
A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking=
, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of=
 which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for=
 the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.
Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron=
's revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l=
onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu=
es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues =
and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s=
elling stakes in energy producers.=20
The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou=
nd 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation =
than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke=
 Energy.=20
But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a "new economy" Web-ba=
sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac=
cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value=
d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan=
y's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p=
rice then.=20
Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stra=
nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Califor=
nia's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stat=
ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic=
 scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's=
 troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20
It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the=
re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or=
 how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that=
 they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20
Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r=
eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f=
rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from =
energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how=
 -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20
Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan=
y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership=
. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a "senior officer of Enron is the m=
anaging member" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron "ma=
nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset=
s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars." It was=
, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20
There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market=
 -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin=
g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially =
when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he sev=
ered his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this yea=
r -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had bee=
n done.=20
As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnershi=
p allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enro=
n relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion=
-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-foo=
ted hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission =
were left with many questions, and very few answers.=20
To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y=
ear ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the co=
mpany. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea =
that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of =
the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of =
which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003=
.=20
We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current r=
ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be se=
en, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and hero=
ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans=
parency.=20
Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of=
 oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and r=
etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. =
It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house=
 -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20

Enron Seeks Additional Financing
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

The New York Times
Page 9, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DALLAS, Oct. 28 -- The Enron Corporation, still struggling to reassure inve=
stors it can weather a financial crisis over complicated transactions invol=
ving its former chief financial officer, is seeking $1 billion to $2 billio=
n in additional financing from banks, an industry official said today.=20
Last week, Enron, the nation's largest energy-trading concern, used about $=
3 billion in available credit lines and spent about $2 billion to pay off c=
ommercial paper. Now, by obtaining even more financing, Enron is hoping to =
convince investors and other energy-trading firms that it will not face a c=
ash squeeze that could lead trading partners to refuse to extend credit or =
do business with it.
Enron's board, which has been holding meetings by telephone over the last t=
wo weeks to monitor the company's financial situation, held another meeting=
 this afternoon. ''The board is meeting frequently and will announce any ac=
tions when appropriate,'' an Enron spokesman said.=20
Two weeks ago, Enron disclosed that its shareholder equity had been reduced=
 by $1.2 billion because of deals with investment partnerships involving it=
s former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who was ousted last wee=
k. The company also disclosed about $1 billion in separate write-offs, and =
it said last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had made an i=
nquiry into its financial accounting.=20
Enron hopes to maintain its investment-grade credit rating, which is crucia=
l to ensuring that other energy traders continue to do business with it. La=
tely, Enron's bonds have been trading at prices more like junk bonds, and t=
wo major credit-rating agencies are considering whether to downgrade the co=
mpany's rating.

GLOBAL INVESTING: Enron stock plunge deals a heavy blow to mutual funds=20
Financial Times; Oct 29, 2001
By AGENCIES: AGENCY MATERIAL and ELIZABETH WINE

Enron shares plunged 40 per cent in the last week,doing severe damage to mu=
tual funds, the company's largest institutional ownership bloc, and the hav=
oc may continue.=20
More than 15 per cent of the 4,000 US equity funds held shares in the embat=
tled company's shares as of the most recent reporting period, according to =
fund tracker Morningstar.=20
Mutual funds held a fifth of Enron's shares, but that percentage is likely =
to be much lower now, say fund analysts, who suggest much of the stock's ha=
lving in October is due to large sales by institutional holders.=20
Janus, the growth fund specialist, was the largest institutional shareholde=
r according to the most recent filings, dated June 30, with more than 42m s=
hares representing a stake worth Dollars 2.1bn.=20
The stake - if still held in its entirety - would be worth Dollars 659m at =
Friday's closing price of Dollars 15.40. Enron shares dropped 95 cents, or =
5.81 per cent on Friday, taking its total fall to nearly 41 per cent last w=
eek on concerns over accounting questions and some limited partnerships cre=
ated by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer. On Friday, several l=
eading rating agencies put the company's debt on credit watches, and Enron =
bond prices plunged. The company's stock is down 81 per cent since January.=
=20
Most fund managers, including those at Janus, refuse to discuss a company i=
n which they are actively trading. However, several mutual fund groups with=
 large Enron stakes have said their listed positions are "dated", implying =
that the funds' positions in the company have changed.=20
Morningstar analyst Christine Benz, who follows the Janus funds, said manag=
ers of the group's larger funds had been "lightening up" their Enron holdin=
gs this year. She said Blaine Rollins, who manages the Dollars 23bn flagshi=
p Janus fund, said that in September he had sold some of his stake - listed=
 as 2.15 per cent of outstanding shares as of April 30 - but did not say wh=
en.=20
Ken Zschappel, manager of the Dollars 11bn Aim Constellation fund, also dec=
lined to discuss his holdings, listed as 0.27 per cent of outstanding share=

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, th=
e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-whee=
ling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20
Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-bas=
ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr=
ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-=
growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.
Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US S=
ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar dea=
ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic=
er, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily=
-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions =
as it answered about these "related-party transactions". The departure of A=
ndy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20
With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron =
has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed=
 it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20
"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side," observes Curt Launer=
, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20
On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete=
riorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor=
 relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial cultur=
e and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to=
 have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a =
cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "new economy" magic o=
n to old economy companies.=20
Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey=
 Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to =
develop energy trading.=20
For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat=
ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy un=
der-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling wh=
o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply=
ing it.=20
The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always=
 been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more=
 likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer =
in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of =
his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackag=
ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20
The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A=
 management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president=
, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. E=
mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they d=
elivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: "It was =
all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."=20
The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a "loose-tight" management m=
odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and M=
cKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b=
usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in=
 existing markets.=20
Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. =
Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative forc=
e behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed=
 jobs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20
Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri=
sk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr =
Skilling once described the approach in this way: "As long as you clear you=
r deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you wa=
nt around here."=20
This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets =
in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather deriv=
atives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c=
limatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. T=
he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world=
's leading e-commerce company.=20
It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v=
enture with International Business Machines and America Online, the interne=
t service provider.=20
In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive=
 of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most power=
ful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of =
America and Boeing.=20
In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac=
hieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he=
 abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-heal=
th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan=
ation.=20
A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to=
 avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron =
used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, =
the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a =
cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other =
financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust =
and Azurix. "They went after too many things too quickly," says Stephen Moo=
re of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20
A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparenc=
y. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi=
al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li=
ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks t=
o which it is exposed.=20
David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many i=
nvestors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management=
: "The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne=
ed for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding som=
ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be =
questionable."=20
The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. "The problems, in our view, =
stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski=
lls," argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Power plants =
in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail =
market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the interne=
t are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant e=
nergy business."=20
Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s=
ome of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr=
on Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This hel=
ped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tr=
ading volumes failed to materialise.=20
"They over-promised on the new business they created," says Chris Bartlett,=
 a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the compan=
y. "Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br=
oadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."=20
Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-th=
e-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant e=
nergy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B=
arney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent o=
f earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the p=
ast three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for di=
sposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty =
of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets.=
=20
And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and =
credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man=
agement methods has tilted too far towards the former. Mr Lay and his team =
will have to tighten up.=20

Enron, the troubled US energy group, was attempting yesterday to persuade b=
anks to provide additional credit to bolster its position after a sharp fal=
l in its share price.=20
The Houston-based company was also due last night to hold a special board m=
eeting to consider confidence-building measures after surprise financial di=
sclosures damaged its reputation among US investors.
Last week the company raised $3.3bn (Euros 3.7bn) in cash to bolster its fi=
nancial position but Enron admitted yesterday that it was still looking for=
 additional finance. The company insisted, however, that it was in good fin=
ancial health and that its core energy trading business remained strong.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said he hoped the company would have somet=
hing to announce in coming days from its latest effort to "establish additi=
onal lines of liquidity". "Once we are able to get the liquidity position s=
hored up, that will put a lot of fears of the unknown to rest," Mr Palmer s=
aid.=20
The company's problems have become public since an announcement on October =
16 that it would take a $1.01bn special charge and write down shareholders'=
 equity by another $1.2bn. The moves followed losses arising from a private=
 equity operation run by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer,=
 who was forced to take a leave of absence last week.=20
Enron's share price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the October 16 a=
nnouncement and its bonds have been trading at levels that are technically =
"junk" status, though its official ratings are still investment grade.=20
"Our concern is that a reduction in the debt rating could impair their abil=
ity to operate their trading and marketing operations," said Raymond Niles =
of Salomon Smith Barney. "These activities require at least an investment g=
rade credit rating, or Enron could be subject to an increase in margin requ=

Enron Seeks Further Credit to Reassure Investors, WSJ Says
2001-10-29 04:30 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide a further credit line of as
much as $2 billion in a bid to restore investor confidence in the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified
officials close to negotiations.

     The new credit line is additional to the $3.3 billion credit
line it tapped last week, the paper said, and should be completed
within days.

     Investors have shunned the company since Oct. 16 when Enron
reported a third quarter loss of $618 million and wrote down
shareholders' equity by another $1.2 billion, the Journal said.
The stock has fallen by 54 percent since the announcement.

     The company's shares were further dented after an investor
sued Enron last month, saying dealings with two partnerships run
by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, cost the company
$35 million. The suit also called Fastow's leadership of the
partnerships, set up to cut Enron's debt, a conflict of interest.

NEW YORK, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Last year, Enron Corp. was a darling of invest=
ors and analysts, but the freewheeling trader of electricity and natural ga=
s now faces a credibility crisis due to a lack of transparency in its busin=
ess dealings.=20
Enron, trying to shake investor jitters over a possible downgrade of its cr=
edit worthiness and their unease over the company's complex financial trans=
actions, has seen its shares shed more than half their market value in the =
past week.
But the largest natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States i=
s not alone in getting its wings clipped as energy prices come down and the=
 market volatility that drove earnings last year eases.=20
While Enron's problems differ from more traditional utilities, many other p=
ower producers are returning to their roots. They are scrapping plans for s=
plitting operations and questioning whether more risky overseas operations =
can be supported by lower prices brought on by a slowing economy.=20
Paul Patterson, an energy analyst with ABN Amro, said there are common them=
es affecting the industry.=20
"One is lower power prices and the margins that are associated with them. A=
nd two is lower stock prices and the ability to finance more asset driven g=
rowth," Patterson said.=20
As earnings fall and forward earnings guidance is revised downward, some po=
wer companies are seeking strategies to address the bleaker environment. An=
d plans to spin off units have been postponed or called off.=20
Shares of Enron slid $1.05, or 6.4 percent, to $15.30 in afternoon trade on=
 the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.=20
THE WORLD HAS CHANGED=20
AES Corp. , a global power producer whose earnings fell for a second consec=
utive quarter on a poor showing from operations in Brazil and Britain, said=
 Thursday it would revamp its organization and did not rule out selling off=
 assets.=20
"It's a different place," AES' chief executive officer Dennis Bakke said of=
 the business climate facing utilities today compared with last year's powe=
rful growth. On Friday, Constellation Energy Group , parent company of Balt=
imore Gas & Electric, scrapped plans to split its power generation and trad=
ing operations into two company because of economic changes. Constellation =
also hired a new chief executive and severed ties with Goldman Sachs, which=
 planned to make an equity investment in the company.=20
"The utility industry and energy markets, and indeed the entire U.S. econom=
y, have changed considerably in the past year. As a combined company, we wi=
ll be better positioned to seize opportunities to grow and deliver," said C=
hristian Poindexter, Constellation's chairman.=20
RETURN TO TRADITIONAL VALUES=20
Bakke said one prong of AES's brave, new world scenario was a renewed empha=
sis on the traditionally profitable, long-term contract generation business=
.=20
It makes sense for power generating companies to sign about 75 percent to 8=
0 percent of their generating capacity into long-term contracts because it =
provides stability and a level of profitability in a period of flat growth,=
 according to Gordon Howald, energy analyst with Credit Lyonnaise.=20
"Calpine does it already," he said, referring to the California-based indep=
endent power producer that has the lion's share of the power it generates c=
ontracted out. "What drove the valuations in all these companies last year =
was that power markets were very inefficient. Physical reserve margins were=
 low. But with flat to down demand in 2001 - as it appears to be the case -=
 there is very little to lead us to believe that power prices will be anywh=
ere near that level," he added.=20
Howald said with all the new generation coming on, natural gas prices shoul=
d remain high but power prices should come down further, squeezing spark sp=
reads, or profit margins, for solely gas fired companies.=20
SMALLER COMPANIES ALSO RETHINK STRATEGIES=20
As lower power prices impact earnings, many power companies are turning bac=
k to U.S. markets to try to maximize their bottom line.=20
"Earnings for the quarter is not the big deal. The big deal is that for 200=
2 they are not going to earn as much as people expected. It's a downward re=
vision of earnings guidance." said Patterson.=20
Michigan-based CMS Energy Corp. cut its earnings estimates for the second t=
ime to $2 to $2.05 for 2002, down from $2.79 and said it would sell off cer=
tain overseas assets and focus future growth primarily in North America.=20
CMS, whose earnings were down for the third quarter, said it took a charge =
for planned divestitures, includingdiscontinued South American energy distr=
ibution units as well as other international investments.=20
Allegheny Energy Inc. also changed its strategy after reporting a fall in t=
hird quarter earnings.=20
The Maryland-based company said while it is continuing to work towards gett=
ing necessary regulatory approvals for a initial public offering to hold it=
s unregulated assets, it will not proceed with the offering at this time.=
=20
"The company will integrated until market conditions are such that demonstr=
ated value can and will be created for shareholders," Allegheny said.

The Texas energy and telecommunications giant Enron Corp. was reportedly ne=
gotiating with its lenders about new credit lines Friday, a day after it dr=
ew down billions on its existing lines.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. are the two banking companies wi=
th the largest lending exposure to the $67 billion-asset Houston company, w=
ith an estimated $400 to $500 million in bank debt outstanding "in addition=
 to derivatives and other structured product exposures," according to Goldm=
an Sachs Group Inc. analyst Lori Applebaum.
Morgan Chase and Citi were the book runners on a 364-day, $2.25 billion loa=
n facility to Enron that closed in May, according to Thomson Financial Secu=
rities Data. Credit Suisse First Boston was the sole bookrunner on a $582 m=
illion loan to the company that closed in March and matures in March 2004, =
the data company said. Bank of America, Citigroup, and Deutsche Bank also p=
articipated, Securities Data said.=20
On Thursday, Enron issued a statement that "in order to dispel uncertainty =
in the financial community," it had drawn on its committed lines of credit =
to provide over $1 billion of cash liquidity. The Wall Street Journal repor=
ted on Friday that Enron drew down about $3 billion from a credit line and =
was in talks about obtaining a new multibillion-dollar line.=20
"We continue to have conversations new our creditors about new liquidity --=
 that's nothing out of the ordinary," said Enron spokesman Eric Thode.=20
The developments followed a $638 million loss for the third quarter, the de=
parture of Enron's chief financial officer, and a Securities and Exchange C=
ommission inquiry.=20
Enron, a natural gas company that has broadened its focus to include energy=
 trading, transport, risk-management, and telecommunications products and s=
ervices, has relationships with banks that extend beyond credit lines.=20
"Citi, J.P. Morgan, and possibly Wachovia and Bank of America also invested=
 along with Enron in some of its partnerships," said Ms. Applebaum. A spoke=
sman for Morgan Chase confirmed that the bank was a lender but said he did =
not know the amount of its exposure.=20
Many other regional banks have participated in credit facilities to Enron. =
Bank of America Corp. is estimated to have about $200 million to $300 milli=
on of exposure; Bank One Corp. about $100 million; and Wachovia Corp., SunT=
rust Banks Inc., and FleetBoston Financial Corp. about $50 million each, ac=
cording to Goldman Sachs estimates. Bank of New York has between $50 to $10=
0 million of exposure, and Northern Trust, U.S. Bancorp and KeyCorp also ha=
ve some lending exposure, Ms. Applebaum said.=20
Representatives of these banks would not comment on their relationships wit=
h Enron, or did not return phone calls by deadline.

JAPAN: Japan's Teijin, Enron study coal-fired power plant.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Japan's major polyester manufacturer, Teijin Ltd =
, said on Monday it would conduct a feasibility study with U.S. energy gian=
t Enron Corp on building a coal-fired power plant.=20
Teijin said in a statement that it and E Power Corp, a Japanese affiliate o=
f Enron Corp, would look into building the 70,000 kilowatt coal-burning the=
rmal power plant in Matsuyama, Ehime prefecture, on the southwestern island=
 of Shikoku, where Teijin has a polyester plant.
"We are beginning to consider selling surplus power to third parties other =
than our own plants, with eyes on further deregulation in Japan's power mar=
ket," a Teijin spokesman said.=20
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last =
year, large-lot consumers have been free to choose their suppliers.=20
In its polyester business, Teijin has expanded overseas output while reduci=
ng domestic production, a trend which would leave it with surplus power. It=
 is thus looking at how to make good use of any surplus.=20
The two firms were also considering expanding the capacity of Teijin's exis=
ting power generator in Matsuyama, Teijin said. It hopes to reduce costs at=
 the inefficient small plant with the help of Enron.=20
Enron Corp said earlier this year it had presented plans to build a liquefi=
ed natural gas (LNG) fired power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become =
the first foreign company to build such a power plant in Japan.=20
The Teijin spokesman said the two firms hoped to conclude the feasibility s=
tudy by June 2002.=20
Teijin's shares ended the day down 13 yen or 2.68 percent at 472 yen.

Enron, Teijin to Build Power Plant in Japan, Report Says
2001-10-28 23:39 (New York)


     Tokyo, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. and Teijin Ltd.
will jointly build a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Japan
as early as 2004, the Nihon Keizai newspaper said on its wire
service, without citing sources.

     Enron, the world's biggest energy trader, and synthetic-
fiber maker Teijin will together spend 1 billion yen ($8.16
million) to build the 70,000-kilowatt plant in Ehime, southwest of
Tokyo, the report said.

     Enron wants to eventually build bigger plants and sell
electricity directly to large commercial users without going
through exiting utilities, the report said.

Once-Mighty Enron Strains Under Scrutiny
By ALEX BERENSON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

IS time running out for Enron?=20
At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant =
energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to pe=
rsuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Calif=
ornia to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its vie=
ws would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.
And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron=
's arrogance had grown even more quickly.=20
The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and cons=
umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for elec=
tricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, =
Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the co=
mpany profited from creating new markets.=20
''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing th=
ose who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''Peo=
ple want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It'=
s the American way.''=20
But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron'=
s investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances ar=
e mounting.=20
Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company=
 worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt=
ed and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enr=
on could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge =
hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998.=
 Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 bil=
lion in shareholder value.=20
Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week lo=
w of $15.04 earlier in the day.=20
The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and=
 soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ende=
d only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by interven=
ing deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making w=
ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci=
ty have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenn=
eth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, =
to resume day-to-day control of the company.=20
The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, availabl=
e for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilli=
ng could not be reached.=20
Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its=
 shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 bi=
llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E=
nron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission=
 is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors ques=
tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin=
g electricity and natural gas.=20
THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall=
 in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chie=
f financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controve=
rsy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seem=
ed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today=
 faces a potential cash crunch.=20
The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concer=
n about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts=
 and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran=
sactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to =
issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas=
h.=20
Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On =
Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previousl=
y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, w=
hich have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's impor=
tance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that=
 any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.=20
The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev=
en if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a p=
roducer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili=
ty of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.=20
Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he tho=
ught Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what wou=
ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's Enr=
onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.=20
''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are the=
y good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger sa=
id. ''It's got everyone scared.''=20
In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the =
company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to iss=
ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee=
d. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va=
luable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th=
e company.=20
A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy trader=
s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the co=
mpany's sales and profits.=20
Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But =
its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now =
offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bon=
ds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Servic=
e and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possibl=
e downgrades.=20
''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' =
said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at =
Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in=
 Kansas City, Mo.=20
For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Rel=
iant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do busin=
ess with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electri=
city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r=
eminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.=20
''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they=
 are closing their books down,'' he said.=20
Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref=
ully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also =
said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly =
to discuss the situation.=20
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading comp=
any had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any o=
f the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He =
said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.=20
But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j=
ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, t=
he details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street =
analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who ow=
n its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creatin=
g lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impene=
trability of its financial statements.=20
Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t=
o the questions investors ask.=20
To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statem=
ents parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly =
regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect En=
ron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the g=
iant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited =
and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.=20
The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr=
eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names=
 like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bon=
ds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water comp=
any subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed t=
he value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the=
 difference.=20
DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial offic=
er when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in sharehold=
ers' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only sk=
impy details of its transactions with those partnerships.=20
Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, =
after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a prom=
issory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' eq=
uity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transac=
tion was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.=20
The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have =
found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen=
ts into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it=
 reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The e=
arnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-=
down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, a=
nd its shares rose.=20
In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's=
 chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The referenc=
e was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those anal=
ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and=
 many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to sli=
de, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so=
 far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved=
 investors.=20
Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain =
the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou=
t Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron w=
ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling a=
nd Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company.=20
In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details a=
bout the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them=
, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.''=20
Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a gra=
sp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking a=
bout them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot w=
e can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the c=
ompany expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by=
 the end of next year.=20
In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enr=
on executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its o=
ther partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the dea=
l, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.=20
David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c=
ompany, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to cl=
arify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very=
 near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha=
t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company wi=
ll likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note=
 after the call.=20
To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, it=
s Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day=
, a higher-than-normal volume.=20
''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil=
ity with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay s=
aid in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strengt=
h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.''=20
But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enr=
on's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six yea=
rs.=20
Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance=
-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new =
shares to make good on its partnership guarantees.=20
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates tha=
t Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said th=
at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign =
assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India =
embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about t=
hose prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring econom=
y.=20
''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their =
backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wedne=
sday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.''=20
''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when=
 management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said.=20
Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disc=
losed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than an=
alysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money=
-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they s=
ay.=20
''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core busine=
ss, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of r=
esearch at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May=
 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these =
transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that prof=
itable.''=20
James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fa=
ll, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the=
 losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company st=
ood by its reported energy-trading profits.=20
Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture=
 of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip=
ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr=
ading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, =
in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.=20
''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that=
 they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist.=20
IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an=
d disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully=
 lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform =
would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi=
on.=20
Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the=
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale e=
lectricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track =
of specific transactions and prices.=20
Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. E=
nron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one=
-quarter of all trading in the United States.=20
Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e=
lectricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power busines=
s was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and=
 their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen =
by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independ=
ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ev=
er-growing portion of the nation's power.=20
Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was als=
o deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline co=
mpany, to move into the trading business.=20
The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1=
990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in Fe=
bruary, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the=
 change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its p=
rincipal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, i=
t had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum pr=
oducts.''=20
For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall =
Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first=
 transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chi=
ef financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals=
 were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involve=
ment.=20
Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit=
 lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have t=
o be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have t=
o pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its invest=
ment-grade credit rating before that.=20
ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could s=
uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's cred=
it. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals s=
old the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term =
to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy ma=
rkets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that po=
sitions that should offset each other do not.=20
Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact=
 the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the =
short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share=

But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take=

Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By Enron
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/28/2001
The New York Times
Page 13, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

AT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Cor=
poration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its ch=
ief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. B=
ecause they were transactions among related parties, the company was requir=
ed to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a=
nswered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the cu=
rrently available answers.=20
Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?
A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it=
 said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other asse=
ts,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun=
ications companies.=20
Q. How did those investments do?=20
A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclos=
ure on that.=20
Q. Why can't that be discerned?=20
A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transacti=
ons with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivati=
ve securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial =
disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement=
s completely.=20
Q. Why were they so complicated?=20
A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One a=
ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on =
transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each =
and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or los=
s. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in tha=
t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on =
the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fa=
ll under that rule.=20
Q. Who made money from these transactions?=20
A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not a=
ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears=
 that the partnerships distributed money to investors.=20
Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?=20
A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything =
seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof=
its each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being discl=
osed was not really important.=20
Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?=20
A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By th=
is summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partne=
rships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate=
d to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the=
 transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out=
 its deals with the partnerships.=20
Q. How did Enron do?=20
A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transact=
ions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it als=
o reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20
Q. How did that happen?=20
A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnershi=
p owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr=
on. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligatio=
ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a s=
hare buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and d=
etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re=
ported earnings.=20
Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?=20
A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to =
say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to=
 enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on t=
hem. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, w=
hich has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRIS

Investors sent stocks markedly higher last week, despite reports on the eco=

Enron Asks Banks for More Credit After Stock Slide, FT Reports
2001-10-28 20:20 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 28 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, asked banks to provide further credit after tapping
a $3.3 billion credit line last week to bolster investor
confidence, the Financial Times reported, citing company sources.

     Enron's stock has fallen more than 50 percent since Oct. 17
when an investor sued the company for conflict of interest over
transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow.

     The company has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans since announcing Oct. 16 it would take
a $1.01 billion special charge and write down shareholders' equity
by another $1.2 billion, the FT said.

     Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said he hoped the company would
announce the new financing facility in coming days, the newspaper
said.

dity, began to repurchase all its outstanding commercial paper yesterday, u=
sing $3.3 billion it borrowed from banks by depleting its lines of credit.=
=20
An Enron spokesman said that when the commercial paper repurchases are comp=
leted the company will retain more than $1 billion in cash.
The moves did not appear to reassure investors, as Enron's share price fell=
 to another six-year low. Shares traded as low as $15.04 yesterday, before =
ending the day at $15.40, down 95 cents.=20
The move will raise the interest expense for the company, because banks nor=
mally charge more than companies have to pay in the commercial paper market=
, and because its outstanding debt will rise by the additional $1 billion.=
=20
Enron's debt is rated investment grade. But its bonds now trade below inves=
tment grade levels, although not so low that it appears investors fear an e=
arly default. But with the bonds trading so low, it is unlikely Enron will =
be able to sell more commercial paper.=20
Enron's stock has been plunging since Oct. 17, shortly after it disclosed t=
hat its third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released, will sho=
w a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity as a result of complicated=
 transactions involving partnerships formerly controlled by Andrew Fastow, =
who was the company's chief financial officer until he was replaced on Wedn=
esday.=20
The stock has lost more than half its value since the earnings announcement=
, and the company has disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission=
 has asked questions about its accounting practices.

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Enron's bond prices drop to warning lev=

Enron, the Houston-based energy trading group, continued to pay a heavy pri=
ce for its lack of financial transparency yesterday as its bond prices plum=
meted.=20
Investor confidence in Enron has declined sharply since the company announc=
ed a $1.2bn reduction of shareholder equity stemming from a complex off-bal=
ance sheet structure. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also launc=
hed an informal investigation into the company's finances.
Enron's five-year bonds were trading yesterday at 77 cents in the dollar wi=
th a yield of 11.13 per cent, down from 83 cents on Thursday. Bond prices a=
t these levels normally suggest that investors expect a company to file for=
 bankruptcy.=20
Late on Thursday, Enron announced that it would draw on its bank lines to b=
uy back its outstanding commercial paper after two ratings agencies put the=
 company on negative watch.=20
Commercial paper financing, which normally has to be rolled every 90 days, =
is one of the first forms of financing to disappear in a crisis.=20
"What they want to do is assure their clients and other trading partners th=
at they are creditworthy and continue with business," said Robin West, chai=
rman of the Petroleum Finance Company, the industry consultants. "In a situ=
ation like this, cash is king."=20
Enron's biggest immediate business risk is that its major trading counterpa=
rties, such as Duke Energy and Reliant Resources, start asking it for more =
collateral, increasing the cost of its everyday business.=20
If Enron were downgraded to junk, the counterparties could do just that.=20
So far, credit rating analysts say, Enron's core business is holding up wel=
l. But their actions over the past few days acknowledge that the company co=
uld still be severely damaged by the scandal.=20
Enron has long faced criticism of its opaque financial reporting, but its m=
ost recent problems stem from the LJM private equity fund run by Andy Fasto=
w, the company's former chief financial officer.=20
Enron compensated its partners in this complex off-balance sheet structure =
by promising to give them Enron shares, if the value of private equity inve=
stments in The New Power Company, technology and other things fell below a =
certain level.=20
Those investments fell $1.2bn in value from the threshold level, which shou=
ld have triggered the issue of 62m shares if the deal had not been reversed=
.=20
The complex deal was designed to make sure Enron did not experience the sam=
e balance sheet volatility that JP Morgan Chase and others have suffered fr=
om marking their private equity investments to market.=20

HOUSTON -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares fell after the largest energy trade=
r tapped a $3-billion credit line because it has been shut out of the leadi=
ng market for low-interest, short-term loans.=20
The company's stock has fallen 54% in the last 14 days after investors ques=
tioned its transactions with affiliates run by Enron's former chief financi=
al officer. The shares fell 95 cents, or 5.8%, to $15.40 on the New York St=
ock Exchange.
Investors said Chief Executive Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure them that=
 the company's credit rating won't be cut. Enron can no longer borrow in co=
mmercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks=
 offer.=20
"Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No," said John Cassa=
dy, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth Third Bancorp. "People ar=
e questioning the credibility of management."=20
The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial =
paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.=20
The price of Enron's 6.75% bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 11/2 point=
s to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86 cents. At that pric=
e, the bonds, which carry a rating of BBB+, yield 9.53%.=20
Investors have grown concerned that the firm's credit rating will be cut af=
ter $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron ne=
eds good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding=
 collateral and to settle transactions.=20
Enron's decision to tap its credit line was "a smart financial move," said =
Stephen Moore of Moody's Investors Service. "It took away the hassle and ti=
me-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and insured access to capit=

Now Enron will begin repurchasing its commercial paper. This is a way for c=
ompanies to raise money over a short period at rates that are usually sligh=

"To some extent, redeeming the commercial paper is at the expense of the ca=

Jeff Dietert, an analyst at Simmons & Co., said Enron management needs to c=
ontinue to make clear the issues that have investors confused and concerned=
.=20
In a worst-case scenario, investor fears could create a vicious cycle that =
continues to drive the stock down, which would force bond rating agencies t=
o consider downgrades of Enron. That could lead to lower credit ratings, wh=
ich would force Enron's energy trading partners to limit their exposure to =
the company and cut back on business with it.=20
"Thus, we see a big incentive for Enron to clarify the issues," Dietert wro=

Enron Corp. filed suit against Microsoft Corp. in state district court in H=

The companies entered into an agreement last June in which Enron would prov=

Qwest Communications is providing the Internet infrastructure in 14 other s=

On Oct. 23, Microsoft said that Enron would have breached the contract if i=

How to Lose a War
By Frank Rich

10/27/2001
The New York Times
Page 19, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Welcome back to Sept. 10.=20
The ''America Strikes Back'' optimism that surged after Sept. 11 has now be=
en stricken by the multitude of ways we're losing the war at home. The F.B.=
I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani t=
han waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactl=
y zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (thoug=
h one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). T=
he Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had beg=
un until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpet=
ed breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcem=
ent that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New J=
ersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary=
-school children again.
Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E=
.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things Tha=
t Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not every=
thing changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-=
front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion =
but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20.=20
This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particular=
ly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the=
 right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic pr=
udence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck=
, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe=
edily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmac=
eutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a pa=
nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's Hous=
e ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston=
 energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush =
campaign cash machine.=20
Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since =
Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, Ser=
viceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates,=
 is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat c=
ats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Ha=
ll Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration =
in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in=
 the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thous=
ands of their employees.=20
To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland =
security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac=
k to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri=
dge.=20
Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a=
 large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam.=
 A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administratio=
n from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job=
s, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right be=
cause he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the =
administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- w=
ho have brought us where we are today.=20
The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those=
 of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber=
 of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. As=
hcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perha=
ps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics overrid=
e public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen=
 no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat=
riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern.=
=20
Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credi=
bility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along=
 with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin=
es it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibi=
lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance o=
f science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is req=
uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of=
 it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospita=
ls -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of a=
ll expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the=
 Republican Bill Frist.=20
It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks=
 of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- =
David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of publi=
c health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointe=
e, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r=
eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr.=
 Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula=
g.=20
As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati=
on about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, whic=
h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n=
ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has s=
ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve=
r been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Gl=
azier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even thou=
gh her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army =
of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international=
 and domestic terrorism.''=20
Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops=
 offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication=
 of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't r=
espond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she add=
s, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple =
of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'=
' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents).=20
If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service=
s inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, the=
re wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R=
. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first =
place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of hom=
eland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 governmen=
t agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to defi=
ne Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa=
s ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing s=
till more confusion.=20
The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Broka=
w -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to=
 shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers.=
 That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision fo=
r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly =
codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment.=20
Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we ca=
n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the =
war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali=
ban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their =
intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''inst=
ead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appear=
s to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.''=20
Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because =
the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a=
 C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol=
itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & S=
houlders shampoo. If we can't effectively fight anthrax, I guess it's reass=
uring to know we can always win the war on dandruff.

City - Enron directors cash in shares.
By Simon English.

10/27/2001
The Daily Telegraph
P31
(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001

LEADING executives at Enron, the troubled US energy giant, cashed in shares=
 worth more than $100m ( #70m) this year in the run-up to a financial crunc=
h that has left the company's credibility in ruins.=20
Research by Thomson Financial shows that Kenneth Lay, chief executive, sold=
 about 400,000 shares this year, netting him more than $25m. He still held =
2.8m shares until July.
Other executives made similar sales, a revelation likely to anger investors=
 who have seen the shares fall from $83 at the start of the year to $45 by =
July. They halved again this week and fell to below $16 yesterday. Enron de=
clined to comment on the share sales.=20
Mr Lay said in a statement that he is seeking to "dispel uncertainty in the=
 financial community" by drawing on lines of credit to restore faith in Enr=
on's financial strength. Enron will pay off debts of $2.2 billion and keep =
another $800,000 in cash. He said: "We know we have our work cut out for us=
 if we are to rebuild our credibility with the investment community."=20
The company is facing an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission in=
to partnerships managed by Andrew Fastow, former chief financial officer.=
=20
Mr Fastow was ousted on Wednesday night as part of the company's moves to r=
estore confidence, though Enron insists he has done nothing wrong.=20
Enron lost $1 billion in the third quarter on what it has called "failed in=
vestments".

INDIA: Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3.

10/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lenders to power plant in India majority owned b=
y Enron Corp have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of r=
eviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday.=20
They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buy=
ing the U.S. energy giant's 65 percent stake, and those of two other U.S. f=
irms, in Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is building the controversial pr=
oject, the source told Reuters.
The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank an=
d Bank of America , will be held on November 3, the source added.=20
At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which =
is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 millio=
n investment of Enron, General Electric Co and Bechtel.=20
All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from =
India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast.=20
The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the se=
cond phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 percent complete, was abruptly stopped =
in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility =
MSEB.=20
MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can n=
o longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly.=20
Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and ser=
ved a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract.=20
Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the m=
atter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a =

HOUSTON -- Enron has sued Microsoft, alleging it breached a contract for br=

Subject: Toll Model Review Meeting Updates



The model review meeting on Thursday went well, and the consensus was that =
there are many changes to be made to the current Foothills economic model. =
Many assumptions in the current model were challenged by the participant co=
mpanies. Foothills agreed to reflect the suggested changes to the model (An=
dy is supposed to send out a summary of the discussion) and provided an ele=
ctronic copy of the model for withdrawn partners' review. Withdrawn partner=
s agreed to give their comments/feedback on the model to Foothills until 11=
/27/01 and another meeting to reach an agreement on economic model/toll was=
 scheduled for 12/03/01 or 12/04/01. The data from economic/toll model will=
 be used in commercial proposal/presentation to the ANS producers which ANN=
GTC intends to have by 12/20/01. Tim and I will review Foothills' cash flow=
 and COS model and prepare comments.

Overall, the participants though that the current Foothills model ($0.43/MM=
Btu toll for Alaska section) has very aggressive assumptions in many ways, =
and it is very likely that the toll will be increased significantly after a=
ll the appropriate revisions are made. The following are the main discussio=
n points of the meeting. Item 1 and 2 are expected to have a very large imp=
act on the toll.

1) Capex and Opex need to have annual/monthly escalation (current model has=
 0% escalation). For example, Foothills sensitivity analysis shows that 2.5=
% Capex escalation would increase the toll by $0.20. Numbers such as 1.5% f=
or Capex and 2.5% for Opex were thrown during the meeting, but more reviews=
 need to be done regarding appropriate escalation rates. Do you have any op=
inion on this, Bryan?

2) Foothills is using Flowthrough method (using cash taxes in COS calculati=
on) to calculate income taxes that go into the Cost of Service and might be=
 underestimating Cost of Service. Tim thought that the Flowthrough method w=
ill not fly because of previous cases in which that method was not allowed =
by IRS and FERC. Foothills said that they can still have same toll under No=
rmalized tax method by changing the depreciation number, but Tim was concer=
ned that it might force the partnership to record negative depreciation. Fo=
othills declined our request to share their Cost of Service model and insis=
ted that we calculate the toll ourselves based on the information in the ca=
sh flow model. They agreed to provide a hard copy of their Cost of Service =
model in the end, but Tim and I were under impression that Foothills was tr=
ying to lower the toll as much as they can. Tim was also concerned about le=
velized toll approach because of FERC might lower allowed return in the lat=
er rate cases and more analysis needs to done regradign this. Please correc=
t me if I am wrong here, Tim.

3) OM & A is currently estimated to be 1% of Capex but this might be too lo=
w (OM&A in more latest cost estimate by Foothills is approx. 1.5% of total =
Capex).

4) The Withdrawn Partners' historical contributions ($228 million) will be =
added to the Rate Base, but this might be dropped if necessary. Success fee=
 of $40 million should be included in the project budget.

5) Working Capital will be added to the project cost. The Line Pack cost (1=
4.5 Bcf for the whole section) was assumed to be borne by ANS producers but=
 some participants highly doubted that that would be the case. The Line Pac=
k gas might have to be bought by the Partnership or the Producers will at l=
east demand certain return on their gas sitting in the pipeline for 25 year=
s.

6) For Return on Capital and AFUDC, 14% ROE and 8% Interest on Debt assumin=
g 30/70 capital structure is likely to be kept. However, the current drawdo=
wn schedule assumes construction financing available from the very beginnin=
g, which will not be true. Certain assumptions should be made on the financ=
ial close date and commercial agreement/preliminary determination date to c=
alculate AFUDC more accurately.

7) Current financing assumption in the model is a 25 year bank loan with ba=
lloon amortization and DSCR of 1.6. In reality, the initial bank loans will=
 be of shorter maturity (5-15 years) and certain roll-over financing will b=
e unavoidable. It is also likely that the loans will have multiple tranches=
 with different terms, interest rate, seniority etc.=20

8) There is significant currency risk associated with Canadian section of t=
he ANGTS considering that some sources of capital, revenues and part of ope=
rating expenses will be in Canadian dollars. A mechanis to mitigate currenc=
y risk should be in place and there might be some costs associated with it.

9) Property taxes of 2% in Alaska seems high, but Property taxes during con=
struction period should be added.=20

Lastly, there is about $300 million difference ($4,336-$4035) between ETS c=
urrent cost estimates and the cost estimate in the Foothills model, excludi=
ng IDC and AFUDC. Another engineering estimate might have to be dome for la=
rger pipe size (46 or 48 inch) as noted in Bryan's email. =20

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. 
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. 
During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. 
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while "we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well." Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. 
Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was "very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about." He added "we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy." 
Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. 
During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. "There's the appearance you are hiding something," said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. "You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board." 
Mr. Lay responded, "We're trying to be as transparent as we can."

Enron Tries To Dismiss Finance Doubts
By FLOYD NORRIS

The New York Times
Page 1, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Enron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. 
In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.
But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. 
The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. 
Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. 
One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. 
After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' 
Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' 
Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. 
Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. 
Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' 
Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. 
Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. 
The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. 
After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.

Options Report
Surge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and Cisco
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

C14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. 
At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.
The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. 
Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. 
The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. 
The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. 
To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.

Lay tries to assure Enron investors 
Company's credibility questioned 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron had safeguards in place to protect shareholder interests while its chief financial officer ran two investment partnerships that did business with Enron, the company's chief executive officer said Tuesday. 
The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. 
Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an "informal inquiry" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. 
It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. 
After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. 
The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. 
Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. 
It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. 
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. 
"I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions," he said. 
Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. 
He did say Enron was aware an "inherent conflict of interest" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. 
In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. 
"There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron," he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. 
Lay and Enron's board continue to have the "highest faith and confidence" in Fastow, he added. 
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. 
Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. 
It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. 
During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. 
They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. 
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. 
Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. 
"I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call," he said.

Busy signal 
Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.
Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about "developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels". 
But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to "address investor concerns" about its financial dealings. 
Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. 
Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 
Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.
The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. 
According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. 
Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. 
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." 
According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. 
Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. 
Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations

10/24/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.
However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. 
Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. 
He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. 
"There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. 
Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share.

Enron Corp., the biggest energy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750-million loan, ensuring access to credit if the beleaguered company is cut off from money markets, say people familiar with the matter. 
Enron's shares and bonds plunged after the firm said the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing its finances.
The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75% this year amid concerns about failed investments, depends on a $3-billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations. 
As a second-tier commercial paper borrower, any ratings drop may cut off Enron from the commercial paper market and raise costs of short-term debt. 
Enron shares dropped 86 cents to close at $19.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars over the next 18 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, treasurer Ben Glisan said. The possible shortfall related to about $3.2-billion (U.S.) in notes that related entities sold to investors since 1999, he said. Proceeds from those notes were invested in various Enron assets. Mr. Glisan said those notes come due over the next 18 months and Enron still hopes to sell enough assets to fully repay the notes. However, making up any shortfall with funds raised by selling stock has become more expensive as Enron's share price has plunged. Over the past week, shares of the energy trading giant have fallen more than 40 per cent.

Abreast of the Market
Everest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay Resilient
By Robert O'Brien
Dow Jones Newswires

10/24/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. 
Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.
In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. 
Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. 
Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. 
Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. 
"Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market," Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. "Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it." 
Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. 
Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. 
The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. 
Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. 
Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. 
There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. 
Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. 
NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. 
Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. 
EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. 
AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. 
Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. 
McKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. 
Furniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.

NEW DELHI -- Following Enron Corp. U.S. energy company AES Corp. has turned to the Indian prime minister for help in settling its grievances with a state government. 
In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES Corp.'s President Dennis W. Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India is being tested by the government of eastern Orissa state.
A copy of the letter, dated Oct. 1, was made available to the Associated Press. 
AES operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49% of the Orissa Power Generation Corp. and manages the main power distribution company in the state. 
AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s. 
In his letter, Mr. Bakke drew Mr. Vajpayee's attention to the "expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation . . . and direct interference with day-to-day management" by the state government and its agencies.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.
By Pete Harrison

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. 
More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled.
"The issue is timing," Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. 
"Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term," he added. 
The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. 
Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. 
Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have "consequences." 
"I wouldn't be surprised by project delays," he told Reuters. "This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment." 
"I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before," he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. 
STOP AND THINK 
The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. 
Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. 
"There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered," Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, "The only risk is things might be delayed." 
Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. 
Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. 
"We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender," Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. 
He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. 
"It's a good time to wait," said Saverys.

INDIA PRESS:British Gas Seeks ONGC Deal For Field Control

10/24/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- British Gas has offered India's Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a cash settlement in lieu of operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields, the Economic Times reported Wednesday. 
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) are claiming operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oil fields following Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd.'s 30% stake sale to BG, according to the report.
State-owned ONGC holds a 40% stake in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields and Reliance owns 30%. 
The Enron Oil & Gas stake sale will fall through if BG isn't given the operatorship of the oil fields, Nigel Shaw, vice president of BG India said in the report. 
Shaw said the equity partners are in discussions on the issue of operatorship, the report said. 
British Gas is a unit of BG Group PLC (BRG). Enron Oil & Gas is a unit of Enron Corp. (ENE).

BG Offers ONGC Brazilian Assets to Get Managing Rights in India
2001-10-24 01:12 (New York)


     Mumbai, Oct. 24 (Bloomberg) -- BG Group Plc has offered Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. a stake in exploration projects in Brazil if
India's biggest oil producer allows BG to run the oil fields it
bought from Enron Corp. in India, the Economic Times reported,
without citing any officials.

     BG's purchase of Enron's 30 percent stake in the three oil
and gas areas in India is contingent on winning the right to
manage the developments. Reliance and ONGC, which together own 70
percent of the exploration venture, have both claimed rights to
run the oil and gas fields.

     BG has asked ONGC to waive its right to decide the operator
after Enron quits in return for a stake in its oil and gas sites
in Brazil, the paper said. It didn't give details on the Brazilian
interests BG may offer ONGC. BG has set Oct. 31 as a deadline to
resolve the ownership dispute, the paper said.

     The purchase from Enron would give BG a 30 percent stake in
the Tapti and Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63
percent of an untapped deposit on the west coast of India. The
assets hold more than 170 million barrels of oil and gas.

     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indian
partners, ONGC and Reliance, as well as from the nation's biggest
refiner, Indian Oil Corp.

WASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals. 
Seven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits.
IBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chain Kroger, $9 million. 
In addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that could total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million. 
Counting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief over 10 years. 
The generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly. 
"It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is," said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. 
For individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than under the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier. 
The primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation "is a shot of adrenaline" that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation. 
"Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy," wrote Thomas, R-Calif. 
While bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid. 
The legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2002, far below the House GOP level. 
"This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly," said Baucus, D-Mont. 
Other Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines. 
Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending. 
"Everything in this package needs to be stimulative," Grassley said. "There needs to be more done on the investment side."

FRANCIS: Lets go to Keith in Alaska with a quick question for Don and Don let`s give us a zippy answer to. 
LUSKIN: All right. 
CALLER: Hey Don I like to know as far as Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) is concerned, how representative of the energy sector is this because I`ve been watching as a small investor that`s kind of brand new, watching it just kind of plummet. So and I`m only investing a little bit every month in it but you think that`s pretty wise idea just kind of keep on doing small investments? 
LUSKIN: Well as a general investing strategy yes but Enron is a special case where we have a company that`s in bad trouble. We had a CEO who basically left without explanation a couple of months ago, then yesterday the CFO has been accused of some pretty strange looking self dealing issues. We don`t know how that`s going to resolve but this is a company under a cloud so you might want to hold off on your buying program until that cloud lifts a little bit. 
FRANCIS: All right Don, thank you very much; we appreciate it. Don Luskin. 
LUSKIN: All right.

Mr. D. McCarty
Managing Director and Chief Commercial Officer
Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. McCarty,

I am writing on behalf of the Mackenzie Delta Explorers Group who are a
group of seven E&P companies with current and proposed exploration
activities in the Mackenzie Delta area. The member companies include
Anadarko Canada Corporation, Alberta Energy Company, Anderson
Exploration/Devon, Burlington Resources Canada Energy Ltd, BP Canada Energy
Company, Chevron Canada Resources and Petro-Canada Oil and Gas.

We are assessing alternatives to transport natural gas from the Delta to
southern markets and will soon be engaging in a feasibility engineering
design study to assess routing,  construction techniques, optimum sizing,
pressure requirements, capital and operating costs, liquids handling,
gathering systems, environmental considerations and other relevant design
parameters.

We are contacting potential strategic alliance partners in the pipeline
arena to determine the level of interest of  participating in the study
and/or contributing information to the Feasibility exercise.

If you require more information and wish to discuss this in more detail,
please fell free to contact me (403-296-4824) or Rod Maier (Chevron Canada
Resources 403-234-5433).

Subject: TW v. SoCalGas (Dictation Draft from Greg Porter)



DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch
2001-10-26 15:00 (New York)

Fitch Places Marlin Water Trust II & Osprey Trust I on Rtg Watch Neg

Fitch-NY-October 26, 2001: Fitch has placed the ratings of
Marlin Water Trust II's (Marlin II's) approximately $915 million
senior secured notes due 2003, and Osprey Trust's (Osprey's)
approximately $2.4 billion senior secured notes due 2003 on
Rating Watch Negative. The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notes
are currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows the
placing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative by
Fitch.

The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfund
account (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enron
in the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. The
overfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated
'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to service
interest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relies
on Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible
preferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferred
securities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, the
transaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loan
to Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.

Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on the
support from the assets in the share trust used to support
interest payments and an equity commitment from Enron to
remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fund
principal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stock
has been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assets
in the share trust supporting interest payments include Enron
unsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well as
quarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertible
preferred stock.

While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale or
liquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, in
each case primary credit support is derived from the Enron
obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock
if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been
deposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturity
date, which is one of the Note Trigger Events. In the event that
the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount
required to redeem the senior notes, Enron is required to
deliver additional shares. If Enron cannot or does not deliver
on this obligation, subject to certain standstill periods, then
the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of
Enron, representing a general unsecured claim. Additional Note
Trigger Events include a downgrade of Enron's senior unsecured
debt below investment grade by any of the major rating agencies
in conjunction with specified declines in Enron's closing stock
price over three consecutive trading days, as well as customary
events of default under the notes. It is important to note that
Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate
market value to fully pay down the associated debt.

Fitch will continue to monitor these transactions in conjunction
with the ratings of Enron, Corp. and will update investors as
appropriate.


Enron's Debt Falls As Company Draws Down On Bank Loans

10/26/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) bond and bank debt was quoted lower early Friday following the Houston energy giant's decision Thursday to draw down about $3 billion on its bank loan facilities. 
Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.
Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. 
Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. 
That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. 
Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. 
Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. 
Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. 
One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
Banks, the investor said, "are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02," the investor said. 
Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) 
"As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books," this person said. 
Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. 
"Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that," the fixed income official said.

Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services Deal
By Michael Rieke
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/26/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. 
Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.
After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. 
In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. 
The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. 
Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said. 

Microsoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't provide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have breached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages. 
The suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal. 
In a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's prior approval. 
An Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the release. 
A Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN 7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, access to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25. 
The Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver "state-of-the-art" video and audio through "dramatically improved" broadband technology. The new service would extend MSN broadband service "to more than 29 million households in 45 markets." 
By the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households capable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access. 
The Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit. 
Neither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. 
The Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet. 
That deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's fiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service.

ENRON UNIT TAKES HEAT POWER GROUP SAYS ENERGY FIRM FAILED BOND REQUIREMENTS
Jeffrey Krasner, Globe Staff

10/26/2001
The Boston Globe
THIRD
C.1
(Copyright 2001)

The retail sales subsidiary of Houston energy giant Enron Corp. faced expulsion last week from the New England group representing power generators, marketers and distributors. The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills. 
ISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to "initiate termination proceedings" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a letter obtained by the Globe.
An Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's requirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels. 
"It was an administrative snafu," said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Enron. "It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on time] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on Friday." 
According to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months. "Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently," said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the letter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization "has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured." 
But Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous "financial assurance" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. Therefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was the third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the current default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that resulted in the letter. "We're working with ISO New England to figure that out," she said. 
The recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's director of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman of Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization. 
"This is not that unusual within the pool," said Allegretti. "I frequently receive notices of technical defaults." As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation, he said, "We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork." 
The incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO. 
Enron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall Street Journal. Enron lost $618 million in the third quarter. 
Yesterday, Enron's shares closed at $16.35, down 6 cents, on volume of 39.1 million shares.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell critics' concerns 
Financial Times; Oct 26, 2001
By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron has put up a page on its website of "frequently asked questions" in response to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's controversial results announcement. 
Unfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with the answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its chief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs. 
However, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle "partnerships". "It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move," says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. "It's not the end of it." 
The shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade lower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars 84.87 until the group improves its transparency. 
One of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement on October 16 concerned "a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in shareholders' equity". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news release on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up conference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in the earnings report. 
It has since been called a "loss" and a "write-off" and Enron's staff have struggled to explain it in plain language. 
Enron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles, Enron "recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These adjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods". 
The confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might hurt its debt rating. 
Mr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts. "I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions," said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer. 
Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. 
"Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them," Mr Niles says. Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso said it was facing "a lot of questions on its accounting practices".

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)
2001-10-26 14:26 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update3)

     (Adds Egan-Jones lowering credit rating in 12th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the company failed to reassure investors its bond
rating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit line
because it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.

     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days after
investors questioned the company's transactions with affiliated
companies run by its former chief financial officer. The stock
fell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.

     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed income
assets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who was
supposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders was
running partnerships for the benefit of himself.''

     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-
term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company will
use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper it
has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009
declined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an
offer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating
of ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.

     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned that
the company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in
third-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs good
credit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demanding
collateral and to settle transactions.


                         Dilution Concerns

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holding of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's Investors
Service has the company on watch for possible downgrade, and
Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to
negative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating on
Enron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.

                         Other Liabilities

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amounts
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

Weiss & Yourman Law Office Announces Class Action Lawsuit Against Enron Corp.

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--A class action lawsuit against Enron Corp. ("Enron" or the "Company")(NYSE:ENE) and certain of its officers and directors was commenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, on behalf of purchasers of Enron securities. If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, please read this notice. 
The complaint charges the defendants with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose material adverse information and misrepresented the truth about the Company and caused plaintiff and other members of the Class to purchase Enron common stock at artificially inflated prices.
This action seeks to recover damages on behalf of defrauded investors who purchased Enron securities. Plaintiff is represented by Weiss & Yourman, a law firm possessing significant experience and expertise in prosecuting class actions on behalf of defrauded shareholders in federal and state courts throughout the United States. Weiss & Yourman has been appointed by numerous courts to serve as lead counsel in class action lawsuits and in that capacity has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of investors. 
If you purchased Enron securities between January 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, you may move the Court no later than December 21, 2001, to serve as a lead plaintiff of the class. In order to serve as a lead plaintiff, you must meet certain legal requirements. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as "lead plaintiff." Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Weiss & Yourman or other counsel of your choice to serve as your counsel in this action. 
If you wish to receive an investor package or if you wish to discuss this action, have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests with respect to this matter, or if you have any information you wish to provide to us, pleas

I've forwarded this to Joe, Rob,a nd MKM as there are some regulatory issues to be considered.  I thought all FERC-regulated electric utilities had to have "OASIS" electronic bulletin boards.  Doesn't PGE have one of those, and if so, can't they post the notice themselves?  Interesting.  DF

I received a call from Portland General Electric (PGE) asking for assistance in posting an open season for them in regards to their Kelso-Beaver Pipeline.  The reason they are asking for assistance is that they currently do not have an electronic bulletin board.  I have attached a draft version of their open season.  The plan would be to utilize the Hot Tap platform for their posting.
 
Please advise if you have any comments regarding this issue.
 
Thank you.

Rod, 
    What is going on?  Every day there is something new, different, and bad about us. Now, the rumor in Houston is that we are filing Ch. 11 on Monday. Is everything out, or is there more to come (Kilmer is about ready to blow an artery)?  Still views that Mark is out, Greg is temporary, and Stan is here for the Company for better or worse. What do you hear?

Danny,

This is a most unfortunate news release.  Kvisle is not current on our consortium's plans to pitch a 4.5 bcf/d pipeline.  Bound to be some media flack on this.

NEWS BULLETIN

December 20, 2001 Vol. 7, No. 157 December 2001

Foothills prepares plan for scaled-down Alaska pipeline 
Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. is about to deliver a proposal for a scaled-down Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline costing about $8 billion - about half most other estimates. 

Hal Kvisle, chief executive officer of TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. - the joint venture partner in Foothills with Westcoast Energy Inc. (which is being taken over by Duke Energy Corp.) - said Dec. 19 a "commercial proposal will be submitted to the Alaska producers very shortly ... within a couple of weeks actually." 

He said Foothills hopes to persuade the producers to get part of the pipeline engineered and then "see how gas supply and demand unfolds." 

Initially, Kvisle said, the new proposal would be for a line to carry about 2.5 billion cubic feet per day from the North Slope, compared with the 4 billion cubic feet that has generally been recommended. 

At that level, he said it would cost $7 billion to build a delivery system to Alberta and, at most, another $1 billion to expand TransCanada's existing export network to the United States. 

Kvisle said the new pipeline would end at Empress, on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, where the gas liquids would be stripped for Alberta's petrochemical industry and the remaining gas would be shipped to the U.S. Midwest. 

"It's a relatively simple thing for us to incrementally expand our very large pipeline system to move 3 to 5 billion cubic feet a day through Alberta to Empress," he said. 

He said that if gas prices were higher than $2 per thousand cubic feet "it would be highly certain the project would go ahead. If it was a dollar lower than it is today, then there would be virtually no way it would go ahead." 

Kvisle said that if the Alaska producers opted to build their own pipeline to Chicago they would have to "commit to the whole thing in one shot. I think the big issue for the producers in Prudhoe Bay is whether or not a pipeline will be built. It's a lesser issue to them whether or not they build it." 

He said talk of an "over-the-top" route appears to have been shelved and his reading now is that the Alaska producers are "leaning more towards a highway route than they were before."

FYI - 

In case you have not yet heard... Richardson Products has not paid their $1,661,000 TW line pack sales invoice.  They are claiming to have a Global Netting Agreement with Enron and are netting this payment with ENA and EGL issues.  We asked for a copy of this agreement even though we are certain that TW is not a party to it.

Paul Cherry, TK, Steve Kleb and I are all following up with our counterparts and are giving the collection of this money top priority.  We will keep you informed.

Rick

USA: Enron seen facing long road to restore confidence.
By Andrew Kelly

10/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. moved in the right direction by releasing more detailed financial data and tackling problems at peripheral businesses, but the energy giant still has a way to go to make Wall Street happy, analysts said Wednesday. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday. The company took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments, measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with.
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was "not thrilled" by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. And for good reason. 
Moody's Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. 
"There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved," Barone said. 
The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company's operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron's stock lost about two-thirds of its value, but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet. 
Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron's quality of earnings and cash flow. 
Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns, but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk, which could adversely affect some of the company's financing arrangements. 
"Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain, particularly overseas," he said. 
One such asset is Enron's 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant project in India, which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer, a local utility company. 
Enron's stock closed down $1.64, or 4.85 percent, at $32.20 on Wednesday. 
For the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period. 
Enron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the company's broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. 
But the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project.

USA: UPDATE 1-RTO seen key to boosting New England power supply.
By Scott DiSavino

10/17/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U.S. Northeast hinges, in part, on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). 
RTOs are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region's high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the interstate wholesale power market, believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers, in turn improving service and driving down rates. 
"If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time, it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation," Enron Corp.'s managing director of global government affairs, Rick Shapiro, told Reuters. 
Houston-based Enron is the nation's top energy marketer. 
"How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market. It's crucial to the development of the market in New England," Mirant Corp. spokesman Ray Long told Reuters. 
Energy provider Mirant, of Atlanta, has 1,400 megawatts (MW) of generation in New England. The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts. 
"Once we get the permits for Canal, we will reassess whether to proceed with the project. A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process," Long said. 
THE NORTHEAST RTO 
FERC wants to see four super-regional RTOs created in the U.S. - in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. 
Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs, including a not-for-profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West. 
FERC Chairman Patrick Wood, seeking to spur the development of RTOs, favors giving utilities until Dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market, though the commission has not voted on this plan. 
The Northeast RTO will include New England, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region and possibly parts of eastern Canada. 
FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets. 
PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., is the nation's only fully functioning RTO. 
"The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM, New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market," Long said. 
Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than $440 million annually by eliminating the "artificial borders that now exist between New York, New England and PJM." 
An administrative law judge, acting as a mediator for FERC, considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO. 
The three plans were proposed by interested parties, including Mirant and Enron, and the region's grid operators - the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) in New York, ISO New England in New England and PJM. 
Last month, the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place. The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England. 
"If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003, consumers could save $1.5 billion ... $440 million a year ... over the New York/New England plan, which would not be implemented until 2006," Long said. 
Under the PJM plan, PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region, while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets. 
"Although nothing is perfect, PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region. New York and New England, which are younger markets, are still works in progress with some bugs to work out," Enron's Shapiro said.

Enron Seeks Replacement For AGA's Gas Storage Report

10/17/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the nation's largest natural gas trading company, isn't ready to let the regular report on U.S. natural gas storage inventory die, a company executive said Tuesday. 
Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year, Enron would like to see another organization take over the report, said John Lavorato, president and chief executive of the company's Americas Wholesale Services unit.
Speaking at a meeting with analysts, Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals. 
Without a regular report on storage gas inventory, the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past, he said. 
The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage, but the information isn't as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday. 
The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct. 9. It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July. The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities. 
It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September. Those estimates are generated by a computer model. 
Wednesday's weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct. 12. The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities. That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report. 
Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consulting firm, take over reports on storage inventory. 
INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They manage many of the gas storage facilities. 
Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited, he said. 
He said he thinks the AGA has found itself "in the middle of something it didn't want to be in." Originally intended for use within the gas industry, the weekly AGA report has become high-profile, and is even watched by equity markets, he said. 
Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report, wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA. Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures. 
When the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports, gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly.

Energy Regulatory Commission, the White House said.
    
If the Senate approves Kelliher, a former Republican counsel
for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the commission will
have its full five members for the first time since Pat Wood,
Bush's first FERC appointee, became chairman Sept. 1.
     
``I hope they speed him through the process,'' said
Commissioner Nora Brownell, a Republican who was appointed by Bush
earlier this year. ``He is a thoughtful person who knows how to
work through issues.''
    
Kelliher's nomination comes as the commission has pledged to
closely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity and
natural gas markets and promote competition. In the next month or
so, it is due to choose which groups will run the electric power
grid around the country, an important step in deregulating the
nation's power markets.
     
A former power industry lobbyist, Kelliher would fill the
opening left by the departure of Curt Hebert, a Republican
appointed by President Bill Clinton and named chairman by Bush.
Hebert left the commission Aug. 31 to join Entergy Corp. after the
White House made it clear Bush planned to make Wood the chairman.
With Kelliher, FERC will have three Republicans and two Democrats.
     
``Kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team now
working actively to finish the transition to truly competitive and
dynamic power markets,'' said the Electric Power Supply
Association, which represents competitive power sellers such as
Enron Corp.
     
The commission is responsible for ensuring fair wholesale
electricity and natural gas prices.



Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales
2001-10-17 14:59 (New York)

Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales

     Washington, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Federal regulators are
considering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity in
California and 10 Western states, which power producers hope will
allow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight.
     
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plans a public
conference Oct. 29 to discuss altering the pricing formula. The
commission established caps in April and June, after skyrocketing
electricity costs led to insolvency for California's largest
utilities, units of PG&E Corp. and Edison International.

     ``We have heard and understand that people do think the
solution was very California-centric, and it was,'' FERC Chairman
Pat Wood said, indicating changes in the formula are likely. ``But
California's needs were very urgent at the time.''

     While commissioners declined to say what they would be
willing to change about the pricing formula, they want to fine-
tune the caps before the winter, which is the peak period of
demand and may yet cause another jump in prices, Wood said.
Changes could be made next month.

     The current pricing formula is based on the most-expensive
power generated in California. Enron Corp., Sierra Pacific
Resources and other sellers of power to California want the
formula to consider costs from all generators in the region.

     Enron blamed the formula for a July 2 blackout in Nevada,
when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too low
based on the highest cost of supply then being offered in
California.

                         Lower Power Costs

     Though the cost of wholesale power in California has dropped
since the commission ordered the first emergency cap on April 25,
Wood said the Western states may face another shortage of power
and high prices this winter.

     The Pacific Northwest depends on hydropower for much of its
energy needs, and rainfall has been below normal this year. Part
of the shortfall in power last year and early this year was the
result of a drought that reduced power available from dams.

     ``I remain concerned about that part of the country,'' Wood
said. ``It has not been raining a whole lot out there.''

     The average price for a megawatt-hour at the California-
Oregon border in September was $24.91, down from $313.70 in April.
A megawatt-hour is enough electricity to power about 750 average
California homes for an hour.

     On the agenda for this month's conference is a proposal to
link the formula to the price of natural gas, a fuel used in many
generating plants.

     ``I'm not predisposed for or against specific changes,'' said
FERC Commissioner Nora Brownell. The Oct. 29 conference will help
the commission determine aspects of the price control that the
parties involved agree are working and those that are not, she
said.

                             Surcharge

     In a related matter, the commission also may halt the 10
percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in California to
cover the costs of collecting bad debt. The insolvent California
utilities now have plans to pay off their debts.

     For power sellers in the West, the current price caps often
require utilities to sell their excess power at a loss, Enron,
Sierra Pacific and other marketers said in statements to the
commission. They said the price they sometimes pay for power is
higher than the cost of supply from the most-expensive producer in
California.

     ``The determination of the proxy price should not be limited
to California generators,'' Enron said in a government filing. It
should be ``determined by the least-efficient generator in the
entire West.''

     Power marketers also should be allowed to recover
``justifiable costs above the proxy prices,'' Enron wrote.

     California officials had demanded the price controls after
PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison's Southern California
Edison racked up more than $14 billion in power-buying losses.

     The caps were extended to other Western states -- Oregon,
Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado,
Montana, Idaho and Utah -- in June because some said generators in
the West could simply get around the cap by selling outside
California when prices were higher elsewhere. The caps don't
expire until Sept. 30, 2002, though they can be changed.

     California said before the price cap was extended to other
states that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboring
states at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoid
blackouts.

     On July 2, Sierra Pacific cut supplies to 10,000 customers
for 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plants
were idled. It couldn't buy 50 megawatts of power in the spot
market, partly because of suppliers' concerns with the federal
cap, company spokesman Paul Heagan said at the time.


Enron Faces Questions Over Limited Partnerships, WSJ Reports
2001-10-17 10:11 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is facing
questions over agreements with two limited partnerships run by its
chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal
reported.

     Fastow set up LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP with
the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships have engaged in
billions of dollars of complex hedging transactions with Enron
involving company assets and Enron stock, the paper said. It isn't
clear from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings what
Enron received in return.

     Enron said about $35 million of its $1.01 billion charge
reported yesterday was connected with the partnerships and
involves the ``early termination ... of certain structured finance
arrangements,'' the paper said. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth
Lay said in an earlier interview that related transactions
involving top managers aren't unusual, the paper said.

     According to the arrangement, the general partner, made up of
Fastow and at least one other Enron employee, received a
management fee of as much as 2 percent annually of the total
amount invested, the paper said, citing the LJM2 offering
document. Fastow declined to comment, the paper said.

Danny,

I met with Phil Lowry, Jerry Martin, John Keller, and Kevin Hyatt to discuss the revised cost estimates for Sun Devil.  My blood pressure has eased somewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level more consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers want to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further squeeze the cost bundle.
  
Here's a quick recap-

$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open season.
$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season.
$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc

The difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM.  

Of this, $218 MM relates to-

-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)
-[$44] MM for 36" pipe vs 30" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to be confirmed by the engineers.
-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)
-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition
-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in original estimate)
-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the original scope)

We can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original project scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won't overbuild with 36" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippers pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future shippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the amount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on finding other potential savings.

The remaining $109 MM comes under the category of "identified risks".  Estimates are provided in current dollars and the "escalation" component highlights the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little recent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs for Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discussions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - - seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust.

Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.
Laura Watton

I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Rod, 
    What is going on?  Every day there is something new, different, and bad about us. Now, the rumor in Houston is that we are filing Ch. 11 on Monday. Is everything out, or is there more to come (Kilmer is about ready to blow an artery)?  Still views that Mark is out, Greg is temporary, and Stan is here for the Company for better or worse. What do you hear?

Dan

Summary Risk Data as of 10/24/2001		
		
		
Active Financial Deals	51	
Active Physical al Deals	35	
P&L  Daily	545,890.37	
VaR	467,367.61	
		

Physical deals modelled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged phsycal positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance metholodogy, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


NOTE: We are reviewing the modelling of one of the financial deals which may have a significant impact on the numbers reported above.


Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances
2001-11-17 11:06 (New York)
     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it
will pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating
Officer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit
will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He
didn't give details.

     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company
plans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit

WILL wonders never cease? Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on=
 the table.=20
Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =
And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=
t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=
is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =
didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.
Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million=
 he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=
ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20
Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=
etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the=
 car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=
s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =
Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =
a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20
Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it'=
s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=
elf to a smaller rival.=20
The stock price incentive=20
How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=
less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes=
 from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20
In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=
ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses=
 and stock options as the average factory worker.=20
Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=
ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or=
 bonuses but from stock options.=20
Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=
nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =
date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=
ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=
ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=
t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's=
 underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20
Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=
olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you=
 talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=
or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20
Keeping the debt hidden=20
Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20
To hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=
s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron=
 was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=
ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in=
 turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20
When Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=
fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that=
 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=
ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping.=20
Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made=
 $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=
nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg=
 News.=20
Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=
le? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=
overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.=
=20
The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=
me stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=
g until that stock price started to fall.=20
Would Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=
wer stock options? Maybe.=20
Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would=
 want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =
$100 million.=20
Just kidding.

Stocks rallied and bonds plunged last week as investors digested some posit=
ive reports about the economy. Inflation at the consumer level declined las=

18.33 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,138.65.=20
But bond prices tumbled while yields, which move in the opposite direction,=
 soared. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.85 percent, fro=
m 4.31 percent a week ago, the biggest weekly move in percentage terms sinc=

Investing
Bullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks
By JAN M. ROSEN

11/18/2001
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=
il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=
rospects for energy stocks.=20
''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina=
 Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad=
 group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=
oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =
top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided=
 that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.
Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=
o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=
or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=
olatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=
s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=
ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=
n cuts.=20
Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=
n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=
e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=
03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=
, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=
02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20
As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =
as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=
, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=
dex is down 23 percent.=20
A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=
. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=
hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=
s.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=
ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=
go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,=
 and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20
WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=
, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=
enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=
ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor=
 non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period=
 of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the=
 lower to mid-$20 range.''=20
Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=
, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20
His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =
''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=
roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several=
 years.''=20
Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects=
 the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to=
 reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=
he company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20
Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =
company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=
tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=
ng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20
William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=
yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=
sm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =
investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies=
 over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=
ources.=20
Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=
les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=
ost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices=
 declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=
om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=
ion cubic feet within weeks.''=20
He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=
dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=
hird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20
The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=
ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =
25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =
nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=
als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also=
 reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=
eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=
ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20
Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=
ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=
ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=
rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20
OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors=
 over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=
sident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=
g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=
he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=
ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20
Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in=
 short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=
spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=
h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees=
 buying opportunities.=20
Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=
olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=
l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=
ent I respect and solid business plans.''

Aquila Energy Makes Provision for Dynegy Withdrawal, FT Says
2001-11-18 19:52 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Aquila Energy Corp. is one of
several energy traders limiting its trading with Enron Corp. in
case Dynegy Inc. pulls out of its bid for the company, the
Financial Times said, citing Aquila.

     Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy
withdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paper
reported.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its
shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron's
collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the
company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.

     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from
the transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

11/18/2001
Sarasota Herald-Tribune
All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =
public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =
as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =
of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.=
=20
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=
lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock=
 was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought=
 by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=
e "junk" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =
but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=
.=20
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =
in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=
uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=
ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by=
 selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=
nerating plants and became the biggest "power broker" in the nation.=20
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=
lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=
st power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=
- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=
ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=
n to examine its business ethics.=20
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt=
 no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=
icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=
nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=
ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=
at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=
2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=
tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=
e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=
onfidence of investors.=20
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leade=
rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=
cause they had friends in high places.=20
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George=
 W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =
new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,=
 owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=
e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=
s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence=
 Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=
ice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=
s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political=
 campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for=
 president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=

Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,=
 administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=
verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=
rable to the interests of Enron.=20
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=

n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =
Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=
king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to=
 reprimand?=20
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=
uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20

Try finishing this sentence: "The best thing about my experience as an inve=
stor in 2001 was ... "=20
Many Americans, contemplating the losses they've suffered this year in the =
stock market, might say there was nothing "best" about what happened to the=
m--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been=
 worse.
With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been less=
ened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =
to keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977.=20
The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's sti=
ll down 13.8% year to date.=20
Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're your=
s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's=
 experiences.=20
With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =
you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful=
 about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20
* "Asset allocation" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=
ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=
t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=
r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20
Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much=
 they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=
set market losses and preserve capital.=20
It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=
ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in=
 the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of=
 mind long term.=20
* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =
late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to=
 shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums=
 into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be=
 rising nonstop.=20
In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=
g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20
Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns=
 on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =
way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=
als, especially retirement.=20
This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have=
 faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =
up lost ground.=20
* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=
e who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street=
 analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=
gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20
Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=
mselves as "experts" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =
strategy at all.=20
Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=
on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that=
 wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=
nous, scale.=20
People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=
ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=
tfolios in the long run.=20
Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into=
 aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =
the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech=
 stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=
n.=20
* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=
talism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=
me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=
erve more capital.=20
Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=
der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much=
 worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =
for another year instead of failing when they did.=20
But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=
f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed=
 a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =
that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to=
 1997 "should not be relied upon."=20
Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=
d managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=
are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =
than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=
ticular sector.=20
These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=
y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20
The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=
rices.=20
Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =
ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =
the weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every en=
ergy consumer.=20
* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better.=
 The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and go=
t it.=20
For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=
s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were=
 going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they=
 were.=20
Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have=
 realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's d=
ay-to-date price changes.=20
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view =
of what truly matters to them.=20
Money is important, but you aren't your stocks, and they aren't you. Life i=

INVESTING James K. Glassman
Don't Be A Pudd'n'head, Diversify
James K. Glassman

11/18/2001
The Washington Post
FINAL
H01
Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved

Warren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,=
 is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, "Too much of =
a good thing can be wonderful." In the market, such a motto would lead you =
to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=
ou really, really like.=20
Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=
ury, calls spreading yourself too thin "diworseification."
Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=
d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're ou=
t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=
f interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=
y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like=
 that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =
as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=
ur portfolio is modulated.=20
The reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=
uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=
e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=
ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =
of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=
hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =
investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something=
 stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=
ing that first disastrous year.=20
Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=
s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=
rill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to=
 pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =
up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=
ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1=
.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=
tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=
ng about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in w=
hat are called "concentrated portfolios." In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=
s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=
s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets.=
=20
If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=
, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=
o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called=
 Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but=
 $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20
It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.=
 As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=
he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-s=
tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report=
 from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined durin=
g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=
9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall's seven=
th-largest holding.)=20
"This fund has had a wretched existence," wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=
apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCal=
l's "faith may turn out to be well placed over time," Kapoor said. Unfortun=
ately, time ran out.=20
My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=
ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=
re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=
fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty=
 was touted as a "long-term capital appreciation" fund, not a sector fund. =
Here, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to.=20
The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=
nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=
choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=
ut that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=
ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=
zel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=
nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=
strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20
For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=
h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=
tfolio. This is called market, or "systematic," risk. Over the past 75 year=
s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=
t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =
has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=
n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=
d a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =
you have to live with it.=20
What you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=
ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=
id what is called "idiosyncratic," or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =
few stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=
s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=
stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =
wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =
sharply.=20
Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=
ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =
that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down=
 to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group =
found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =
more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=
u need to own more of them.=20
But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=
Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=
he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=
p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=
oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=
enanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell.=20
One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=
ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=
ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=
nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=
sk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=
t's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =
are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=
letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=
unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and=
 the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=
n 16, at last count.)=20
There are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain.=20
In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =
Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain'=
s Pudd'n'head Wilson: "Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=
t basket!" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=
tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=
une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20
We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that "human=
 beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to.") But smart diversif=
ication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20
James K. Glassman invites comments at jglassman@aei.org, but he cannot answ=
er all queries.

Wessex Water `to be sold'

(Copyright 2001 Independent Newspapers (UK) Limited)

Wessex Water, the water and sewage company, is understood to be up for sale=
 following an offer to take over its owner, Enron, by Dynegy, the US energy=
 group.=20
Three years ago, Enron spent pounds 1.4bn on Wessex Water. But Dynegy is un=
derstood to want to concentrate on US and European energy assets and is not=
 interested in non-core assets.
Any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the indust=
ry is put off by regulatory problems, and the company's results have worsen=
ed due to imposed price cuts over the past year.=20
"It is not that there is going to be a fire sale but most of [the internati=
onal assets] are not core to the businesses we will continue to pursue," sa=
id an Enron spokesperson. "At the right price we will sell."=20
Scottish & Southern Energy and United Utilities have been touted as potenti=
al buyers, yet industry insiders believe that the UK regulator, Ofwat, will=
 take a dim view of bids by UK water companies, as they are too large to bu=
y it.

Quanta steels itself against takeover bid

(Copyright 2001)

Quanta Services, which builds and maintains power and communications lines,=
 said Friday it is fighting a "creeping takeover" by UtiliCorp United, one =
of the nation's largest utility holding companies.=20
On Thursday Quanta board members changed the Houston company's shareholder =
rights agreement - called a "poison pill" defense against takeovers - to de=
ter UtiliCorp from acquiring a controlling stake.
The action was taken after negotiations with UtiliCorp fell apart and the K=
ansas City, Mo.-based company announced its intention to resume purchases o=
f Quanta stock.=20
A spokesman told Bloomberg News on Oct. 4 that UtiliCorp wanted to increase=
 its stake to the mid-40s percentage range, which would give it effective c=
ontrol, with a vote on management.=20
UtiliCorp invested $320 million in Quanta from September of 1999 through Fe=
bruary of 2000, said UtiliCorp spokesman Ethan Hirsh, bringing its ownershi=
p up to 28 percent, and has been adding stock since then. It owned about 38=
 percent when a standstill agreement stopped further purchases in early Oct=
ober.=20
Part of the shareholder rights amendment limits further purchases by Quanta=
 by reducing the trigger point for the poison pill to 39 percent of Quanta'=
s outstanding shares, instead of the 49.9 percent that has been in effect j=
ust for UtiliCorp.=20
In addition to saying that UtiliCorp is no longer "an exempt" person under =
the 39 percent trigger, the amendments changed the kind of securities to be=
 issued in the event the pill is triggered and how they could be exercised.=
=20
UtiliCorp had a higher trigger point that other potential acquirers because=
 it already was a significant shareholder when the plan was initially draft=
ed.=20
Hirsch didn't think the amendments would prevent his company from buying mo=
re.=20
UtiliCorp's interest in Houston acquisitions is not limited to Quanta. Its =
also said this week it would like to buy Enron's share of a United Kingdom =
power station that provides electricity sufficient to light 1.88 million ho=
mes.=20
It will soon get a 27 percent share in the station near London, known as th=
e Teeside power station,through the purchase of a utility there. It would l=
ike the 42.5 percent that Enron owns, UtiliCorp President Robert Green said=
 in a conference call.=20
Green said he understood that stake was on Enron's for-sale list.=20
UtiliCorp revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it b=
ought 1.538 million shares of Quanta's common stock on the open market, at =
a cost of more than $24 million, between Sept. 28 and Oct. 3.=20
Quanta's stock declined 27 cents to close Friday at $15.69, while UtiliCorp=
 rose 10 cents to close at $27.50. Quanta's stock is down 51 percent for th=
e year to date, and hit a 52-week low of $9.94 on Sept. 21.=20
"After many weeks of negotiations with UtiliCorp, we could not reach agreem=
ent upon a strategy that would allow UtiliCorp to consolidate our financial=
 results for accounting purposes on terms acceptable to Quanta," John Colso=
n, Quanta's chief executive officer, said in a written statement.=20
"In the face of UtiliCorp's communications last evening breaking off negoti=
ations and stating its intent to resume open market purchases of Quanta sto=
ck, the board acted to protect the best interests of all Quanta stockholder=
s against a change of control transaction which did not provide an appropri=
ate benefit to all shareholders," he said.=20
Quanta has a mutually beneficial relationship with UtiliCorp and hopes nego=
tiations can resume, Colson said.

AT ENRON, THE BIG DOGS ATE FIRST

11/17/2001
Portland Oregonian
SUNRISE

(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)

Summary: Workers' ire over 401(k) plans is understandable=20
Watching Enron's bigwigs lose their jobs after inflating profits may offer =
some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer=
. But don't bank on it.
When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions =
while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be har=
d not to be bitter.=20
As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees =
of Portland General Electric, an Enron subsidiary, watched their retirement=
 savings sink after Enron announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 mill=
ion in the fourth quarter. This came after Enron officers made more than $1=
36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20
Then on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated=
 earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few wee=
ks, Enron shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday.=20
The four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods=
. Enron and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports=
 were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included =
obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p=
arent company's profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was.=20
The weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. =
Because the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to m=
ake any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi=
nts out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. =
And although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the histo=
ry of the plan, Enron seemed to be an attractive investment.=20
Company executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promote=
d to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold m=
ore than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records cove=
ring the first half of the year.=20
Former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in =
an action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales be=
tweeen March and November of last year. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executiv=
e, who returned after his protege Skilling left, made at least $20 million =
in stock sales from late last year. He has announced that he would decline =
his severance package.=20
Dynegy, another Texas energy marketing company, has made a bid to buy Enron=
. That probably means the best Enron and PGE employees can hope for now is =
that Dynegy will be a better corporate owner, or they can try their luck wi=
th one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's activities.=
 If its behavior was illegal, there will be consequences for company office=
rs.=20
That's still not much to offer to workers who have seen their retirement sa=
vings dissolve. But for now it's all there is.

But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=
hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's big=
gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=
bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =
#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20
Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, we=
re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =
too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in "auction=
 theory" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=
tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G'=
s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy pr=
ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20
Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=
iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=
anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=
ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=
ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=
bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =
true risks at Enron.=20
Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?=
 The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =
on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.=
=20
Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =
of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=
l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=
ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=
TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=
tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =
at which point they were "safe" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=
k.=20
That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=
oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =
15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=
nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.=
 Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=
roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=
ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20
Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =
area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=
ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=
he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding=
 companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=
tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bu=
bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well=
 as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =
maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities=
 of new equity.=20
Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =
is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =
engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=
ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =
thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=
ich just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors t=
his year.=20
Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =
market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over=
 recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year=
 have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=
; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being=
 made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=
ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =
of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =
will really change.=20
The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed=
 many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=
ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=
r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are sti=
ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20
A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=
ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=
ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=
fter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=
h pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=
on packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=
fectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other=
 shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20
Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=
eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=
smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20
In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=
onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=
nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =
people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=
ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances
2001-11-17 11:06 (New York)

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances

     Houston, Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. investors hope
the energy trader's third-quarter report to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that
sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival
Dynegy Inc.

     Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly
explain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday's filing more
on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, as
well as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves related
to Dynegy's $24 billion buyout.

     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects the
likelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing of
such a deal,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty
Utilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.

     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent in
three weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run by
Enron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such as
previously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit rating
and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``There's been so much skepticism about what Enron's
liabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantify
this,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery Asset
Management LP, which holds Dynegy shares.

     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failed
investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to
Dynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with
investors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severance
package of more than $60 million that he could have collected
following the takeover.

     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell
$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.

                           Balance Sheet

     Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected last
week, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of
earnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enron
reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to
include losses from affiliated partnerships.

     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet
summarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balance
sheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press
releases announcing earnings.

     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Lay
mentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with
two partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or its
assets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led to
the ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what
(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said Commerzbank
Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' and
doesn't own them.

     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While the
balance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, which
were set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company's
books, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said.

     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''
Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''

                           Credit Rating

     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron's
legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``will
help us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong American
Utilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.

     Both companies are based in Houston.

     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``It
may say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencies
have told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at
Williams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''

     Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy held
off on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would
be cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash needed
to settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.

     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it
will pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating
Officer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit
will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He
didn't give details.

     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company
plans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit
and operations in Europe, analysts said.


     Enron has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. and
about a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided between
London and Houston, where Enron employs about 7,500.

     Many Enron workers are already preparing for layoffs, said
Lyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles
International Inc., an executive placement firm.

     ``I got 56 resumes last week from Enron,'' Taylor said.
``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''

WestLB Offers to Buy Enron's U.K. Water Unit, Newspaper Says
2001-11-17 20:01 (New York)


     London, Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, Germany's largest state-owned bank, is one of
several suitors talking to Enron Corp. about its Wessex Water
unit, which is valued at more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4
billion), the Sunday Telegraph said without citing sources.

     Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy Enron for $24
billion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.
WestLB made a formal offer to Enron in the past few days in hopes
of striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid the
regulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in the
U.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to the
Competition Commission, the newspaper said.

     Enron bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG of
Germany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interested
in Wessex, but Enron thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWE
bid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.
water company.

     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout for
Railtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s train
tracks and stations, the paper said.


Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. closed Wednesday
on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its Transwestern
Pipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it had
received a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investment
banks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cash
reserves.

     Enron secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern and
the Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined are
about 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic
feet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured with
the Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage and
is expected to close next week, Meyer said.

     Enron agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in a
transaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.
The move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company's
shares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federal
investigation of accounting irregularities that limited its
ability to finance operations.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and
Dynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided Enron,
through Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday as
part of the buyout agreement.

     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights
in the Enron unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the merger
isn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire Northern
Natural Gas, Enron said in regulatory filing Wednesday.
ChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion after
the merger closes to maintain its equity stake.

     The shares of Enron fell 48 cents to $9, while shares of
Dynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. Both companies are based in Houston.
Shares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco fell 35 cents to
$83.45.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

I tried to call you today to let you see the announcement I am running on a number of org changes including Steve Hotte. Unfortunately you were both in the air and I am away next week, so I've run it anyway. I'm pretty sure we have all the bases covered and  you guys wont have any problem with it.

Yesterday I had a meeting with my staff to review recent events, including the revised earnings announcement last week, the merger agreement and anything else on their minds.  

Perhaps besides the field, this may be the largest concentration of long-tenured employees.   Their personal financial losses are tremendous, especially when considered against their annual compensation.   As might be expected, they express their frustrations and resentments with Enron management.  Still, I am struck by their ongoing commitment to ETS and doing their jobs.  They seem eager to have the opportunity to show our accomplishments to Dynegy when the time is right.   

They ask lots of questions.. most of which I could readily answer.  

Here are two that I could not answer.  I'm hoping HR can help me with responses:

- Prior corp. correspondence said that the Click at Home program is under review.  One employee reported that he tried to log in to order a computer this week and the system was unavailable.  They want to know whether this means that the program has been canceled.

- I received several questions about Savings Plan/ESOP loans.  Is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?

Joel,
      I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you, but I don't.  Try Geoff Roberts at Entergy (281)-297-3120, Rich Kinder at Kinder Morgan (713)369-9000, or you could try Anadarko in the Woodlands.  I know that Duke is still hiring, too.  The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.  You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.  In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.  I wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine, so let us know.

     Take care.

Dan

Ever really want someone to wake you up from a bad dream...

The good news is Enron Freight is no longer one of the non-core business entities on the fence. The bad news is we fell on the wrong side of the fence. The word is, basically, sell yourselves to someone or liquidate.

Any suggestions on where I should start looking?

Our house hasn't sold in Indy yet, but the job market there is pretty slim. Think we'll go ahead and plan to stay here in Houston.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Joel

Hi Danny,

Great to hear from you.   Overall, everything is moving forward as planned.   We have had informal discussions with Shell Gas Trading and Duke - both have expressed an interest but we do not have next meetings set up yet.   We just met with the IT group with Duke today, and I would like to meet next with the Marketing group - have you ever met Mark McFearson (VP Marketing)?

We have a big meeting with Williams on Thursday, 10/25 to meet with all of the pipelines and their Strategic Marketing group as well.   I had requested to have their Owensboro and Salt Lake City pipeline business units to come into Houston and they have accommodated us.   Williams requested a demo by EOL so I have also coordinated with Dan Diamond to present their package as well.  

Columbia Gulf and Kinder Morgan are next on our list to try to meet with, so it would help out if you could get us in the door with your contacts.   I have left a message with Julie this afternoon to call me on Monday to get some time with you to catch up in person.  I would like to discuss Luminant at that time also.   

Thanks again for the support!   Martha

       If you have some available time next week, call Julie and get on my calendar.  Thanks.

The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a "wet" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and "unwaive" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being "dry"  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it
 
Timing---  we said we would attempt to get back to them mid January--  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Dave N.

The good news is Enron Freight is no longer one of the non-core business entities on the fence. The bad news is we fell on the wrong side of the fence. The word is, basically, sell yourselves to someone or liquidate.

Any suggestions on where I should start looking?

Our house hasn't sold in Indy yet, but the job market there is pretty slim. Think we'll go ahead and plan to stay here in Houston.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Joel

FYI, Daschle is heating up the debate on Alaskan pipe, but note Pat's quick analysis.

Subject:	RE: Daschle may allow ANWR vote in Senate, according to Press

If  they have 60 votes, Daschle's "consent" isn't needed.  You break the fillibuster and invoked cloture.  There's no need for any deal on the Alaska pipeline.  If anything, the Dem leadership seems to be using the Alaska pipeline as a political football to distract attention away from their refusal to allow a vote on ANWR.  If they can establish that the Alaska gas pipeline is the key to solving America's energy security needs, then it's not such a big deal to block ANWR.

It's an interesting strategy, but I don't know if it works.

Daschle Sets Conditions for ANWR Vote in Senate 
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) has indicated that he will allow a vote on oil and natural gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) if the pro-ANWR forces in the Senate can pick up 60 votes to bring the proposal to the floor. 
Since any move to introduce an ANWR initiative assuredly will be followed by a filibuster, he said at least 60 senators would have to vote in favor of cloture to end the filibuster so that the proposal could proceed to the Senate floor for action. Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) has vowed to filibuster any ANWR bill. 
Daschle's conditions for an ANWR vote came under immediate attack from Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-AK), a key ANWR proponent. He questioned "why is the Democrat leadership so afraid to give ANWR a straight up or down vote? Why do we need 60 votes to pass this?" ANWR, Murkowski added, "is certainly something that should not be filibustered." 
Daschle further tied his consent for an ANWR vote to the Senate getting behind a compromise measure to build a long-line pipeline from Alaska to the Lower 48 states. Murkowski, as well as other key Republican senators, denounced this "quid pro quo" offer, calling it "inappropriate." 
Murkowski said it hasn't been established yet if specific legislation will be needed for the Alaskan pipeline, other than to streamline the permitting process and possibly offer economic incentives to the sponsors of the project. In addition, he believes the Senate should withhold any action until the three major Alaskan producers --- ExxonMobil, Phillips and BP -- complete their study on the feasibility of constructing the pipeline, and an application is filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
Nevertheless, Daschle's remarks were noteworthy because it was the first time he publicly expressed an interest in the Alaska pipeline, noted a press aide to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "When he expresses an interest in the pipeline, you can be sure it is shooting to the top of the list" of items on the Senate agenda. 
Senate Democrats, for the most part, see "ANWR as just a big distraction," while the "Alaska pipeline is the big deal," the committee spokesman noted. Republicans, however, have expressed "some anxiety" about the pipeline issue overtaking the ANWR debate. "An Alaskan natural gas pipeline isn't going to do anything to help reduce our dangerous dependence on foreign oil," argued Murkowski. 
In a related development, Democratic and Republican members of the Senate Energy Committee had been expected to meet throughout last week to discuss issues to be included in comprehensive energy legislation that will be sent to Daschle for Senate action before adjournment. It wasn't known how much of a monkey wrench the anthrax scare on Capitol Hill threw into these plans, however. 
Murkowski said that he expected to have a scaled-down energy bill ready last week for introduction by the Republican leadership, but that never materialized. 
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham came to Capitol Hill last Tuesday to help propel the Senate into action. Energy legislation "needs to occupy center stage" in the Senate now, he said, adding that it was a "high, high national priority." 
The House of Representatives "has done its job; it's time for the Senate to act," he told reporters. "This is legislation that does not need a lot of time on the floor to be finished." It is "not a highly complicated process," Abraham noted. 
Moreover, "I think it would be great if the Senate had a fair vote on ANWR," said Abraham, who was flanked by several Republican senators, including Murkowski. "I don't think there has to be much haggling" on the issue.

One of my goals as ETS General Counsel is to assure that the group is organ=

nts in the most efficient manner possible.  One of the ways to do this is t=
o modify our internal organization to better track the "functionalized" org=
anization that ETS has recently adopted in the operations and commercial ar=
eas.  Additionally, we must continually revisit the way we allocate our res=
ources to reflect client priorities.  Accordingly, I am pleased to announce=
 that Colleen Raker will begin reporting directly to me, effective immediat=
ely.  Richard Melton, Lee Huber and Kim Wilkie will report to Colleen.  Col=
leen's team will have primary responsibility for serving the "new business =
generation" efforts within Steve Hotte's IT group and Phil Lowry's Operatio=
ns group.  Additionally, Colleen's team will focus on asset purchase and sa=
le transactions and financings, while Colleen and Richard will take lead re=
sponsibility on pipeline security efforts led by Mike Nelson's team.  Each =
of these lawyers will also continue serving the numerous other clients they=
 assisted before this organizational change.

Lou Soldano's group will continue its emphasis on serving the needs of the =
rest of Phil Lowry's organization, including the key area of right of way a=
cquisition and other legal requirements related to pipeline expansions.  Gr=
eg Porter's group will continue its focus on   commercial and regulatory ac=
tivity on the NNG and TW systems.  Greg's group gets reinforcements on Mond=
ay, as Bill Rapp is joining us from EES.  Bill will focus on TW matters, an=
d will coordinate closely with Tony Pryor, Maria Pavlou, and Greg and Dot a=
s he gets up to speed on the busy TW docket.  Dot McCoppin's group will con=
tinue its role supporting all commercial and regulatory activity for Citrus=
/FGT.  Dot's group will also assist with TW matters as appropriate.

Given the dynamic business we are a part of and the small size of our group=
, the organizational structure outlined above is intended to be very flexib=
le.  Each of us will continue to be called on by clients to assist with pro=
jects that don't fit neatly into the above structure.  That is part of the =
challenge we face, but also part of the fun we enjoy! =20

Please join me in congratulating Colleen on her new responsibilities and in=
 welcoming Bill to the group on Monday! =20

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Enron Warns of Problems Eroding Profit

Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand obligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Yesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - Wall St worries over Enron deal.
By ANDREW BALLS, ANDREW HILL and GARY SILVERMAN.

11/20/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets. 
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were under the impression that the "material adverse change" clause could be triggered.
"There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, or even likely to happen," one banker said. "And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good," he added. None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified. 
The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met with officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago. 
The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness. 
Moody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid. 
In justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure. 
But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose. 
According to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, possible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron.

Enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter 
$690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s financial well-being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings Monday. 
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron said it reduced third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors. 
The company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt. 
The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
Enron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires Enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency Standard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership's assets. 
Enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
If Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investment grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water Trust. 
Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat. 
The turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company's board of directors. 
The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock. 
The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
"The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
Andersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to the company's unusual finances. 
A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor. 
In June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges.

Enron Corp. warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $690-million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a Monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships.
If the debt isn't paid, the partner could liquidate the partnership's assets, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
Enron has already used up its $3-billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash. 
The company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would put its loss at 87 cents a share.

A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a "review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP," said the letter.
Dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. 
Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending.

U.S. Official Calls for Probe Of Andersen, 2 Problem Audits
By Judith Burns
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal Europe

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
In a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Andersen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.
Enron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival Dynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 million euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Enron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Management. 
Andersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management's reported earnings in the mid-1990s. 
In addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of directors. 
Given the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen's track record, "there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process," Mr. Dingell wrote.

[Focus on Retirement, Pay and Getting Ahead] 
Passing Up
Some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages. 
Last week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits. 
"In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance," says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice leader of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York. 
Alan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associates, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents "the continuing trend of executives being clueless." 
(For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from exercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Thomson Financial.) 
Three top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to gain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At US Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the company. 
Firm Relationship 
New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first-year associates. 
For two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a designated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year. 
Jordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by American Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated, ranked the firm last. "It wasn't an accurate reflection of the firm," he says. "But it was a wake-up call." 
So, CWT created an "associate task force" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was one result. 
Hiring Blitz 
Despite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way. 
ZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently announced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. It has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home. 
"We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have great realtors," says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and culture. 
Since August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The company has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects. 
The job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission based. New hires also receive cellphone and car allowances.

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

11/20/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company
The Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question. 
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further. 
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon. 
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September. 
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year. 
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities. 
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced. 
''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' Ms. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.'' 
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms. 
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced. 
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share. 
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9. 
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million. 
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet. 
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''

Decision to locate ConocoPhillips in Houston enhances world's energy capital
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

11/20/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller Conoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital. 
"Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it," said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
"All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employee growth base," he said. "It is easier to conduct the business in the Houston market because not only are all the major companies there, all the support is in Houston as well." 
The dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though the nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each has thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city. 
It all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources lay beneath Texas soil. 
"Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries," said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm. "But certainly with high-speed communications developed over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers. 
"What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into today's oil capital." 
Shell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting and related companies. 
In recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city. 
"Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place," Bill Gilmer, an economist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent publication. "The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to Hollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit." 
And, it seems, energy companies to Houston.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Energy deal savings set to increase.
By ANDREW HILL.

11/20/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved
ChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003. 
David O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months of the deal, which was completed last month.
Mr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries about the falling oil price. 
"Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don't want to be in this business," he told reporters after addressing analysts in New York. 
Mr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident that the ChevronTexaco deal was right. 
ChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas production. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share after tax. 
ChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the rival energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immediately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a further $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the deal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity. 
Mr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at Enron. 
ChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron, and Mr O'Reilly said there was "a full suite of due diligence" that needed to be done on other issues at Enron. 
* Enron's lenders welcomed the energy company's openness yesterday following a meeting in New York. Greg Whalley, Enron's president, led the meeting, which was postponed when Dynegy began talks with Enron two weeks ago. 
"Much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job," said one. Another banker said Enron management had been "pretty upfront" about the problems at the company, although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting.

Enron restates Q3 to deeper loss; toils to restructure $690M payment

HOUSTON (AP) _ As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter results Monday, increasing its loss for the period by three cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. 
``We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,'' he said. 
Palmer said that when Enron's credit rating was reduced it triggered a clause in one of the ``limited partnership agreements that could cause that $690 million obligation to become due beginning next week.'' 
Houston-based Enron, being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share. 
Dynegy is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock. 
In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ``should not be relied upon'' and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the company's earnings reports. 
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million, from $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion. 
In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, or $628 million more than previously reported. 
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations _ trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
In the filing, Enron reiterated it is developing a plan to exit $8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ``below acceptable rates,'' and expects to use the proceeds to repay debt.

Enron restates third-quarter earnings

HOUSTON (AP) - As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter earnings, increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. 
The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a dlrs 690 million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. 
"We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation," he said. 
Palmer said the obligation could come due because of Enron's lowered credit rating. When the rating was reduced, it triggered a clause in one of the "limited partnership agreements that could cause that dlrs 690 million obligation to become due beginning next week." 
Houston-based Enron, which is being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a cent to 20 cents a share. 
Dynegy is purchasing the company for dlrs 7.8 billion in stock. 
In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 "should not be relied upon" and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the company's earnings reports. 
That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by dlrs 586 million, from dlrs 2.89 billion to dlrs 2.31 billion. In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997-2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was dlrs 10.86 billion, dlrs 628 million more than previously reported. 
By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumbably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. 
"We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
The merger is expected to go through by next summer. Dynegy, backed by major investor ChevronTexaco Inc., will also assume dlrs 13 billion of Enron debt. 
Enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 percent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an acknowledgment that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating partnerships run by company officials. 
The partnerships led to a dlrs 1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity and allowed Enron to keep about half a billion dollars in debt off its books. 
Credit services also have diminished Enron's long-term debt to just above junk grade. 
In the filing, Enron also reiterated it is developing a plan to exit dlrs 8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing "below acceptable rates," and should be able to use the proceeds to repay debt. 
Shares of Enron were up 6 cents to dlrs 9.06 in trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron announced its latest filing after the market close.

USA: Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings.
By C. Bryson Hull

11/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week. That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships. 
If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. 
Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said. 
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported. 
It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust. 
Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and "would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," the company wrote. 
Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability. 
CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to "Baa3" and "BBB-minus," just one notch above "junk" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects commercial paper, to "Not Prime," a junk rating. 
In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices. 
All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner. 
Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity. 
The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock. 
In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of "the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures." 
Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Enron Warns That Raft of Problems May Hurt Its Fourth-Quarter Profit

11/19/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron (ENE) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand obligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
"We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Monday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

Enron Files 10-Q For 3Q With SEC

11/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a share was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end of the quarter. 
As reported, Enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances.
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $618 million on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. 
In a press release Monday, the company said its earnings of 19 cents a share for the nine-month period of 2001 were increased by 1 cent a share. 

Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. 
In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. 
According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements. 

Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting non-core businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 
Enron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the financial impact, but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hurt by employee severance, restructuring and other charges, according to Corporate Filings Alert. 
The company had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at Sept. 30. 
On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002.

Fears Mount Over Enron/Dynasty Deal
Bruce Francis, Kathleen Hays

CNNfn: Markets Impact
(c) Copyright Federal Document Clearing House. All Rights Reserved.
KATHLEEN HAYS, CNNFN ANCHOR, MARKETS IMPACT: There are mounting fears about the fate of the Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) /Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) deal. Financial Times once again has a scoop. Robert Thomson is the U.S. Managing Editor of the FT joining us now with details. Robert what`s going on I thought this was suppose to be a done deal? 
ROBERT THOMSON, FINANCIAL TIMES, U.S. MANAGING EDITOR: Well that`s right Kathleen but the interesting thing that make it perhaps not so done a deal is what we might call the materially adverse clause. That there is a change in the conditions surrounding Enron that makes (INAUDIBLE) a downgrade of them possible and really leaves the financial institutions exposed to them. And these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the Financial Times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize.
HAYS: Well I must say I think this is very interesting and I`m surprised not that I`m an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that Enron was getting the deal done with Dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table. So what, what do you think? What are you hearing that they`re finding now that makes things look worst than they already look? 
THOMSON: Well really that`s the issue. To be quite honest we don`t know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that Enron is in this situation that it`s now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that (INAUDIBLE) surrounding Enron still have it and that they suspect that Dynegy might have it. It looks quite more (INAUDIBLE) the deal. Now Dynegy is saying but we`re going ahead with this yes there is that clause there, yes it covers us in case we find something that we don`t like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we don`t` feel it will have to activate it. But of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it. 
HAYS: Go ahead Robert I`m sorry. 
THOMSON: So, but the truth is you know the full extent of Enron`s exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transaction`s the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it. 
HAYS: What happens if the deal falls through? What happen to Enron? 
THOMSON: Well there`s a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this there`s certainly concern in the banking community. Again, that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to Enron isn`t fully comprehended and frankly that`s why they spoke to the Financial Times because they thought well there`s an impression that this is a done deal, that the Enron problem is solved. They`re saying actually not so. 
HAYS: Wow. Well I think we have just enough time to take a look at you`re you got us something in China again. You take us to that world part of the world frequently what`s going on there. 
THOMSON: Yeah we Beijing (INAUDIBLE) here. Essentially the IFC the International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank is taking a large stake in Chinese Bank in Nanjing (ph). That is amazing really. It`s by far the largest stake, $27 million, 15 percent in the Nanjing(ph) City Bank and it`s really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in Chinese banks over the next year or so. There are two small ones there already where people have taken 3, 5 percent in Chinese banks but for the first time International institutions are in a position where they can think about Chinese retail banking in a serious way. 
HAYS: OK Robert well thank you very much I guess that`s something for investors to watch. Particularly people who are global investors.

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)
2001-11-19 22:03 (New York)

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)

     (Adds in first paragraph that note payment may come next
week.)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which agreed to
a takeover by Dynegy Inc. after a financial crisis threatened it
with bankruptcy, revised third-quarter earnings for the second
time this month and said it may have to make early payment of a
$690 million note next week.

     The Houston-based company lowered results by 3 cents a share,
bringing its third-quarter loss to 87 cents, or $664 million,
according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing.
Liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth-
quarter earnings by $700 million before taxes, Enron said.

     The disclosures don't indicate that Enron is in much worse
shape than on Nov. 8, said John Olson, an energy analyst at
Sanders Morris Harris. That's when Enron lowered its earnings back
to 1997 by $586 million, reflecting losses by affiliated
partnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books.

     ``I don't think anyone would be particularly surprised that
they had to adjust third-quarter earnings (again) considering they
restated earnings for the last four years,'' said Olson, who
doesn't own shares of Dynegy or Enron. ``I don't think it's a
problem.''

     Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cut
Enron's fourth-quarter earnings. Enron is obligated to back
Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because
Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by
$700 million, the filing said.

                       Partnership Problems

     Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron is
forced to pay judgments of more than $2 billion to settle lawsuits
over its dealings with affiliated partnerships. Dynegy has said it
can cancel the transaction if Enron's litigation costs and other
liabilities grow to $3.5 billion or more. Enron faces at least 23
such lawsuits.

     Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and
take debt off its books. Its shares plunged by 89 percent this
year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were
being used to hide losses from failed investments.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this month
that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost
Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. The company wrote
off $1.01 billion in investments in water, telecommunications and
retail-energy sales in the third quarter.

     A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by
Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the $690
million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee
the debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the company
said.

                        Brazilian Liability

     Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership
that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the
partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     ``If we can't talk lenders into refinancing, there is the
possibility that . . . note would be due next week,'' said Karen
Denne, an Enron spokeswoman.

     As of Friday, the company had $1.3 billion in cash on hand.
It expects to close on $450 million in additional financing
tomorrow, and to complete $800 million in asset sales by the end
of the year. It's also trying to find investors who will put $500
million to $1 billion into the company.

     The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using its
pipelines as collateral. It received $1.5 billion from
ChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. In
return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in an
Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy can
acquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through.

     Enron closed on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday that was secured
with assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. It expects to
close on another $450 million loan, secured with other Northern
Natural Gas assets, this week, Denne said. The commitment for the
loans was announced Nov. 1.


                      $3.9 Billion Liability

     The company also has huge liabilities that could push it into
financial crisis before the merger closes. A further drop in its
debt rating, which would put it below investment grade, would
trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt owed by two other
affiliated companies, Enron said.

     The rating drop would force it to repay $2.4 billion in debt
owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million in debt taken on by Marlin
Water Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, didn't grant final
approval of its financial statements in the filing because of an
internal investigation of its dealings with affiliated
partnerships, Enron said. The SEC is also investigating the
partnerships, which were run by Enron executives.

     The filing was released after the stock market closed. Shares
of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy rose $1.13 to $43.60.
ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy and is
providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout, fell
54 cents to $82.91.

ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)

     (Updates with Enron reducing third-quarter results in last

     New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s exposure to
investor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout by
Dynegy Inc., said David O'Reilly, chief executive officer of
ChevronTexaco Inc., which is helping to back Dynegy's purchase.

     ChevronTexaco is ``paying particular attention to the
litigation risk,'' though ``we still think it's a good deal for
Dynegy and an even better deal for ChevronTexaco,'' Reilly said at
an analyst meeting in New York.

     ChevronTexaco, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, owns 27
percent of Dynegy. It agreed to provide Dynegy $2.5 billion as
part of the Enron purchase. Dynegy can cancel the bid if Enron's
legal liabilities, including investor suits, exceed $3.5 billion.
Enron said today in a regulatory filing it can't calculate the
cost of shareholder suits.

     Dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival Enron, the largest
energy trader, for stock and debt now valued at $20.7 billion.
Enron's stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns it
was using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt.

     Gold Bennett Cera & Sidner LLP filed a class action suit in
Houston today alleging Enron misrepresented its business and
results. Other investors have filed similar suits.

     ChevronTexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risks
in the next few months, O'Reilly said. ``There is no transaction
that is risk free,'' he said.

     Shares of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06 today. They have
tumbled 89 percent this year. Dynegy gained $1.13 to $43.60. The
stock has declined 22 percent this year. Both companies are based
in Houston.

     ChenvronTexaco, based in San Francisco, fell 54 cents to
$82.91.

     Earlier this month, Enron reduced its earnings in the past
four years by $552 million because of accounting errors involving
affiliates. Enron ousted its chief financial officer, and it fired
its treasurer and a company attorney for making improper
investments in one of the affiliates.

     Enron reduced third-quarter earnings for a second time and
said it may have to make early payment on a $690 million note
this month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.




Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week

Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron said a drop in its
credit rating may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov.
27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt.

     Repayment was triggered by the Nov. 12 downgrade in Enron's
senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by Standard & Poor's, the
company said in a securities filing.

     Enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note or
repay it, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said.

    Without repayment, partners in a Limited Partnership that owns
natural gas assets in Brazil can immediately begin to liquidate
the partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working with
lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.

     A further drop in its debt rating, which would put it below
investment grade, would trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt
owed by two affiliated companies.

     The rating drop would trigger repayment of $2.4 billion in
debt owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million owed by Marlin Water
Trust, the company said in the filing.

     Enron is being bought by Dynegy Inc. for $25 billion in stock
and debt. Enron also said in its filing that if shareholder
lawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $2 billion, the
Dynegy deal could collapse.

    The filing was released after the stock market closed.  Shares
of Houston-based Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy shares rose
$1.13 to $43.60. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, fell 54 cents to $82.91.



Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow

Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Azurix Corp., Enron Corp.'s
water unit, may have to sell assets if it can't find financing to
continue operations, the company said in a regulatory filing.

     Enron took Azurix public in June 1999 and then, after the
water company's stock plunged, took it private and paid off
investors in March.

     Azurix isn't sure it will be able to renew or refinance about
$113.3 million in long-term debt, including bank loans, that
matures before Sept. 30 at a ``reasonable'' cost, it said in a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
company also had $326.3 million in short-term debt as of Sept. 30.

     The loans are Azurix's ``primary sources of liquidity,'' the
filing said. If the company can't raise the funds, it might have
to use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt and
get cash, the filing said.

     If those asset sales don't generate enough money, ``Azurix
may need to sell other assets, which could result in Azurix
incurring losses in future periods,'' the company said.

     Azurix, though it still must file with the SEC, no longer
trades as a separate stock. The shares of Houston-based Enron fell
8 cents to $8.92 in early afternoon trading.

     Enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rival
Dynegy Inc. in a transaction currently valued at $24.9 billion.
The buyout came after Enron's shares plunged amid an SEC
investigation of the company's dealings with affiliated
partnerships.



U.S.'s Dingell Seeks Probe of Arthur Andersen, Dow Jones Says
2001-11-19 15:24 (New York)


     Washington, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative John
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, has requested a special
investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP's audits of Enron Corp. and
Waste Management Inc., Dow Jones Newswires reported.

     Dingell sent a letter to Public Oversight Board Chairman
Charles Bowsher asking for the review, the newswire said.

      Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, served
as Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring
investors the company's financial statements conformed with
generally accepted accounting principles. Earlier this month, the
company reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million over
four-and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion
because of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidate
results of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.

     In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission in which it neither admitted
nor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of Waste
Management, Inc. Andersen is now undergoing a peer review by
Deloitte & Touche, Dow Jones said.


ENRON RESTATES Q3 RESULTS
>From CBS.MarketWatch.com

By Leticia Williams

8:35 PM ET Nov 19, 2001

WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Embattled Enron Corp. restated its third-quarter
earnings Monday,  increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share
to 87 cents, according to an SEC filing.

Houston-based Enron (ENE), which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to
escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street  confidence,
also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20  cents a share.

Dynegy (DYN) is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.

Enron must also pay off or refinance $690 million in debt obligations
by Nov. 26 or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in additional payments,
according to the SEC filing.

If the company doesn't make the payment on that date, the investors
have the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certain
limited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable.

In addition, Enron may sell the limited partnership's assets for
amounts below their carrying values.

"The net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repay
Enron's obligation, " according to the company's 10Q filed Monday with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Enron is in talks with lenders to "develop a mutually acceptable"
amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $690 million
note.

If the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating falls
below investment grade, it will be forced to pay off or refinance up to
an additional $3.9 billion, the company said.

Standard &amp; Poor's currently has the company rated at BBB-, a notch
above speculative grade. Fitch rates the company's credit at BBB-,
evolving. Moody's Investor services rates the company Baa3, under
review. All ratings apply to the senior unsecured debt of the
corporation.

A note trigger would force the company to repay, refinance or cash
collaterize certain facilities in the amount of $3.9 billion, which
primarily consists of $2.4 billion in Osprey Trust and $915 million in
Marlin Water Trust, Enron said in the filing.

The company's (ENE) shares gained 6 cents to close at $9.06.

Company officials didn't immediately reply to questions about where it
would raise the money, since it's effectively barred from the capital
markets.

Hi Jim, yes there are files available. Is this for Arthur Andersen ? (I could not tell from Heather's e-mail address)  We have a task force looking into this on behalf of Enron and there is a data room that would have the old Partnership Agreement. This data is under a confidentiality agreement, so I would say contact Drew Fossum about it.  If that is a problem, I have a copy of the old ANNGTC Partnership Agreement (pertaining to the Alaskan segment of ANGTS) that I extracted from InterNorth's old files last summer.  Let me know.

Sensitivity:	Confidential

Eric:

I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECO-Panda financing for Societe Generale (lead arranger with Citi on the $2.2 bill. merchant project financing).  Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit.  Due to confidentialities, Jim could only go so far on some details, so you'll note a number of gaps; however, this should cover many of your questions.  Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further.

Also attached - after notes - is an article that should capture many of the financing details.  Given other demands, I've not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable.  A word of caution - PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes.  I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo. but am doubtful on receiving this.  Distribute further as you see fit.

Summary of Call
This was a merchant financing with both projects (Phoenix and El Dorado, Arkansas) cross-collateralized and x-defaulted - so treated as a single financing.  
Approx. 2250 MW per site for total of 4500 MW (with 4 separate units per site).
Sources of funding - Total of $2.8 Bill. ($2.2 Bill in debt and $600 MM in funded equity).  Apparently all of the $600 MM equity was funded at close June 01' [further confirmation is needed].  Of the $2.2 Bill. in debt, $1.7 Bill. was non-recourse and $500 MM was an equity bridge, with recourse to partners.  However, lenders looked principally to TECO's credit backed by several guaranty of equity bridge and fronting of the $600 MM in funded equity.
Partnership - 50/50 in all respects (ie. vote and economics).  However, TECO must have some preferential rights (eg. cash flows etc..) given their substantial commits on the deal.  
Term of debt - 2 yrs. construct facility plus 3 yr. mini-perm with bullet at maturity (approx. 8% amortized at maturity).  Five years is the market for merchant deals.  Amortization is 18 yr. mortgage style.  144 A expected form of permanent take-out of term debt.  
Leverage - 60% financed by term debt, but approx. 50% debt financed when adding all ancillary facilities and other commits (ie. working capital, letters of credit etc..).  Jim kept details to minimum but further info. is needed here.
Key Ratio was debt service coverage.  Base Case assumed an average DSCR of 3.40X and Min. of 2.40X with cash trapped at 1.75X.  Did not get detail on whether DSCR was both historical and forward looking, but suspect there was some kind of forward test.  Project finance banks typically expect 3.25 to 4.25 DSCR on merchant finance deals.
Leverage, DSCR and structure in general was done based on what is generally required to gain investment grade rating from agencies when permanent take-out is sought.  Additional rating agency requirements can be found on Moody's and S&P web sites.  
TECO also will act as operator.  TECO was clearly crucial to deal and at least Soc. Gen. had done prior deals with them (not sure about Citi).  Panda brought TECO into the deals.  Although Panda was a known quantity, Soc. Gen. had no direct project history with them.
Fuel and Power Off take - Lenders looked to extensive an Energy Management Program analysis.  The EMP presumed (by C.O.D.):  50% of fuel and power would be under firm contract, 25% of each would be covered by seasonal swing contracts and remaining 25% would remain merchant.  Intention is a complete match (term and volumes) for fuel and power contracts.  Agency agreements were signed with Noble (1yr. contract) on fuel supply mgt. and Aquilla (2 yr. contract) for managing power sales.  Each buys in name of the projects.  TECO is responsible for overall energy mgt. and coordination between Noble and Aquilla.  Jim said EOD is triggered if fuel and power agreements are not signed in line with E.M. Program by C.O.D.  Lenders got comfortable with lack of fuel and power contracts due to substantial equity commitment (approx. $1.1 Bill.).
Consultants were Pace for fuel supply and overall energy management and RW Beck for power market eval.
Fuel Transport - Much of medium term contracted at close (mix of firm and interruptible capacity) out to 7 yrs.  Lenders looked to new and released capacity to fill non-contracted needs.

Thanks for the quick response.  The objective at ETS is to arrange a long term gas transportation agreement with the Gila Bend project.  We estimate their requirements to be 386,000 MMBtus/day and understand that El Paso has agreed to provide 100,000 MMBtus/day.  Gila Bend is one of several potential strategic shippers for our project and we are extremely interested in the credit quality of their project, recourse to parents, etc.

Danny:

I read through Ron Abraham's consulting contract and wonder if we have the most current copy.  The term is for January 1,1992-December 31, 1992 and the signature page reflects 1991 dates.  I see the extension reference in the term clause but, did not see an addendum that reflected dates?  Am I on the right track, is this agreement current and in force as of today?  
There is no mention of termination of agreement other than death (that would be final), felony or refusal to perform duties. No out clause?
Hope this helps you.

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
"Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=
on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a "leave of absence" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a "Chinese wall" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an "=
informal inquiry" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=
, moved from a "hold" to a "sell" rating.=20

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a "sell" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. "We are concerned abou=
t what we don't know," Ms Coale said. She was concerned that Enron might ha=
ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=
tomers to competitors that were not under such pressure.=20
Enron believes such concerns are misplaced and the SEC inquiry will prove t=
he company has done nothing wrong. Lex, Page 16.=20

Shares in Enron, the US energy group, fell again yesterday after Prudential=
 Securities issued a "sell" note on concerns that the $1.2bn loss taken by =
the company last week might not be the end of its bad news.=20
In the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading, Enron's stock was the=
 biggest percentage loser, dropping 20.2 per cent to $15.80 - its lowest le=
vel since August 1995. /
"We are concerned about what we don't know," said Carol Coale, the Prudenti=

She was disappointed that Enron had not been more forthcoming in the confer=
ence call it held on Tuesday in response to charges it was not being transp=

Investors have been abandoning the stock since October 16, when Enron told =
analysts it was taking a $1.2bn loss in shutting down funding mechanisms it=
 had set up in controversial partnerships established with Andrew Fastow, t=

This charge has not been thoroughly explained, leading to confusion among a=

Enron=20
To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=
ts third quarter release, was undermined by its decision to gloss over a $1=
.2bn equity charge related to the closing of "related party transactions" w=
ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=
nyone?=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=

 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=

Enron Corp. Cut to `Market Perform' at Banc of America
2001-10-25 08:49 (New York)

     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US=

was downgraded to ``market perform'' from ``strong buy'' by analyst William=
 J
Maze at Banc of America.


Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions
By PAM EASTON
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=
stors already have by ousting its chief financial officer a day after the c=
ompany stressed its confidence in Andrew Fastow amid a Securities and Excha=
nge Commission inquiry.=20
"It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=
n or it could be interpreted as if Enron removed the CFO at the request of =
the SEC," Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale said Wednesday. "W=
ho knows?"
Enron officials hope it will result in increased investor confidence after =
the energy trading giant's stocks have declined in value each day since Mon=
day's announcement that the SEC had inquired about partnerships that did bu=
siness with Enron while they were managed by Fastow.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay said after markets closed=
 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
"I think change is good at this particular point in time," said FAC Equitie=
s analyst Robert Christensen said. "I think Andy was somewhat beleaguered."=
=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
"I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements," Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
"There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=
parent to the financial community," Heim said. "Instead of being more trans=
parent there is more confusion than ever."=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20
"The market was asking for that to happen," J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feyg=
in said of Fastow's departure. "This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis."=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been "cautious and defensive in their app=
roach," he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
"I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges," Heim said. "What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed."=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=
ure, Heim said.=20
"It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=
ing able to weather the storm and being a healthy company if not a year fro=
m now, two years from now," he said.=20
But much is going to depend on how much Enron discloses to its investors, F=
eygin said.=20
Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =
McMahon to leave his job as treasurer.=20
"Internally, Jeff was always a proponent of Andy not being involved in (the=
 partnerships)," Feygin said. "Three days ago I would have said there is no=
 need for a change at the CFO level. Today, it was pretty obvious it was so=
mething Enron needed to do."

Enron fires CFO to quell unrest: Stock meltdown

Facing a crisis of confidence in the market, Enron Corp. replaced its chief=
 financial officer yesterday as its stock continued to tumble.=20
After failing to rally the support of analysts in a damage-control conferen=
ce call Tuesday, the Houston-based energy trader dropped chief financial of=
ficer Andrew Fastow, who has been linked to transactions being looked at by=
 the Securities and Exchange Commission. He was replaced by former treasure=
r Jeff McMahon.
The move came after Enron shares (ENE/NYSE) dropped US$3.38 to US$16.41. Th=
e stock has dropped 55% in the past two weeks -- wiping out US$10-billion o=
f shareholder wealth.=20
"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO," Enron chief executive Kenneth Lay said.=20
Early last week, Enron reported a US$618-million third-quarter loss, result=
ing from US$1.01-billion in write-offs.=20
The company also disclosed a US$1.2-billion reduction in shareholder equity=
 for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to=
 a partnership that for a time was headed by Mr. Fastow.=20
In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of =
growing concerns by analysts and major investors. The SEC is currently look=
ing into the partnership arrangement.=20
The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conferenc=
e call Tuesday morning with Wall Street analysts to reassure investors.=20
During the call, Enron officials declined to specify Mr. Fastow's role in t=
he partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsu=
it filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties=
 by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run the partnerships.=20
The stock came under renewed pressure early in the day after analyst Carol =
Coale of Prudential Financial downgraded the stock for the second time this=
 week, to "sell" from "hold." Ms. Coale said the rating change is "not beca=
use of things we do know but because of things that we potentially don't kn=
ow about the company."=20
Volume was very heavy, with 75.8 million shares changing hands. Average dai=
ly volume is 6.7 million shares.=20
J.P. Morgan analyst Anatol Feygin was also less than impressed with Enron's=
 line during the conference call.=20
The company acknowledged that transactions with partnerships run by its chi=
ef financial officer led to a writedown of US$1.2-billion in shareholder eq=
uity. But Mr. Feygin said management was "defensive" when pressed for detai=
ls.=20
Ms. Coale reduced her price target down US$15 from US$55, assuming more bad=
 news was to come.=20
While the allegations of impropriety cloud Enron, Mr. Feygin said the compa=
ny's credit situation could be the more crucial factor for its short-term f=
ortunes.=20
Last week, Moody's Investors Service placed all US$13-billion of the compan=
y's long-term debt securities on watch for possible downgrade. If Moody's l=
owered its rating, Enron's short-term debt costs would rise.

Shell-Shocked Enron Parts With CFO

Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) problems won't go out the door with =
Andrew Fastow.=20
The finance chief, who was replaced Wednesday, came under scrutiny as the e=
xecutive who orchestrated and profited from a hedging deal that went sour, =
saddling Enron with a $1.2 billion charge to equity. As details of this dea=
l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=
sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20
Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that=
 once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =
once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=
ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=
astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =
formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20
How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=
lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to=
 show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=
ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained=
 about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =
Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=
y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20
Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=
n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=
t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20
Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=
k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a=
 difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=
ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=
er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=
rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=
he company?=20
The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and=
 Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=
essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20
Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=
owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=
siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=
ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20
In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=
he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=
band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=
rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge=
 that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=
ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=
he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=
sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had=
 not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20
Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =
Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent=
 on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =
has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=
nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =
spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=
arency.=20
Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=
r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 29, 2001
ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff "so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was "a tortuous process." 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While "both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof," the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting (see Daily GPI, Aug. 30). The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. "Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power." 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the "index-to-index" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate "to minimize any risk on transportation options." The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations (see Daily GPI, July 26).

WILL wonders never cease? Last week a couple of heavy hitters left money on=
 the table.=20
Mark McGwire, the home-run-hitting baseball player for St. Louis, retired. =
And he let it be known that he never signed a two-year, $30 million contrac=
t his agent negotiated last spring. Why? Because he wanted to find out if h=
is injured right knee would allow him to play as well as he had before. It =
didn't, and he decided he wasn't worth that kind of money.
Then Ken Lay, chairman of Enron Corp., said he won't take the $60.6 million=
 he had coming to him in a severance agreement that comes into play when En=
ron is sold to Dynegy Corp.=20
Of course, neither McGwire nor Lay will ever have to consider my fallback r=
etirement plan - sacking groceries at the supermarket, carrying them to the=
 car and hoping for a big tip. Still, it was a class act on both their part=
s. McGwire only hit .187 last season, well below his lifetime average. And =
Lay? Well, let's say that rarely in the history of American capitalism has =
a company sunk as fast as Enron.=20
Remember that earlier this year its stock hit a top of $82 a share. Now it'=
s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=
elf to a smaller rival.=20
The stock price incentive=20
How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=
less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes=
 from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20
In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=
ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses=
 and stock options as the average factory worker.=20
Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=
ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or=
 bonuses but from stock options.=20
Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=
nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =
date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=
ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=
ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=
t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's=
 underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20
Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=
olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you=
 talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=
or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20
Keeping the debt hidden=20
Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20
To hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=
s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron=
 was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=
ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in=
 turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20
When Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=
fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that=
 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=
ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping.=20
Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made=
 $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=
nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg=
 News.=20
Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=
le? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=
overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.=
=20
The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=
me stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=
g until that stock price started to fall.=20
Would Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=
wer stock options? Maybe.=20
Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would=
 want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =
$100 million.=20
Just kidding.

Bullish, and Patient, on Energy Stocks
By JAN M. ROSEN

11/18/2001
The New York Times
Page 8, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

DESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=
il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=
rospects for energy stocks.=20
''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina=
 Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad=
 group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=
oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =
top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided=
 that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.
Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=
o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=
or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=
olatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=
s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=
ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=
n cuts.=20
Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=
n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=
e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=
03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=
, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=
02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20
As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =
as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=
, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=
dex is down 23 percent.=20
A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=
. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=
hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=
s.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=
ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=
go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,=
 and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20
WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=
, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=
enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=
ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor=
 non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period=
 of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the=
 lower to mid-$20 range.''=20
Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=
, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20
His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =
''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=
roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several=
 years.''=20
Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects=
 the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to=
 reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=
he company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20
Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =
company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=
tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=
ng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20
William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=
yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=
sm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =
investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies=
 over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=
ources.=20
Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=
les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=
ost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices=
 declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=
om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=
ion cubic feet within weeks.''=20
He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=
dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=
hird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20
The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=
ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =
25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =
nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=
ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=
als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also=
 reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=
eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=
ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20
Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=
ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=
ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=
rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20
OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors=
 over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=
sident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=
g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=
he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=
ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20
Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in=
 short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=
spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=
h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees=
 buying opportunities.=20
Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=
olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=
l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=
ent I respect and solid business plans.''

Aquila Energy Makes Provision for Dynegy Withdrawal, FT Says
2001-11-18 19:52 (New York)

     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Aquila Energy Corp. is one of
several energy traders limiting its trading with Enron Corp. in
case Dynegy Inc. pulls out of its bid for the company, the
Financial Times said, citing Aquila.

     Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegy
withdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paper
reported.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after its
shares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accounting
irregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron's
collapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where the
company does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.

     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw from
the transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.



PERSPECTIVES
A tale of greed and hubris
Waldo Proffitt

All
F2
(Copyright 2001)

For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =
public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =
as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =
of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.=
=20
A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=
lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock=
 was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought=
 by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=
e "junk" level.
What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =
but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=
.=20
Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =
in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=
uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20
It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=
ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by=
 selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=
nerating plants and became the biggest "power broker" in the nation.=20
Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=
lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=
st power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=
- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20
The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=
ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=
n to examine its business ethics.=20
Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt=
 no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=
icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=
nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=
ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=
d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=
at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20
Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=
2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=
tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=
e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=
onfidence of investors.=20
So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leade=
rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=
cause they had friends in high places.=20
The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George=
 W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =
new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,=
 owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=
e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=
s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence=
 Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=
ice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=
s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20
Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political=
 campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for=
 president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=
gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=
idential Inauguration Committee.=20
Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,=
 administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=
verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=
rable to the interests of Enron.=20
And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=
rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=
n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =
Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=
king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to=
 reprimand?=20
Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=
uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20

Try finishing this sentence: "The best thing about my experience as an inve=
stor in 2001 was ... "=20
Many Americans, contemplating the losses they've suffered this year in the =
stock market, might say there was nothing "best" about what happened to the=
m--in fact, nothing good at all, perhaps other than that it might have been=
 worse.
With share prices on the rise again, the damage to portfolios has been less=
ened. Even so, stocks will have to post strong gains in the next six weeks =
to keep this from being the market's worst calendar year since 1977.=20
The blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 1.6% last week, but it's sti=
ll down 13.8% year to date.=20
Yet those losses, while certainly not trivial (especially when they're your=
s), can obscure what arguably are some very positive aspects of this year's=
 experiences.=20
With investing, adversity can be a more important teacher than success. If =
you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful=
 about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20
* "Asset allocation" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=
ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=
t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=
r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20
Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much=
 they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=
set market losses and preserve capital.=20
It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=
ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in=
 the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of=
 mind long term.=20
* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =
late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to=
 shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums=
 into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be=
 rising nonstop.=20
In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=
g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20
Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns=
 on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =
way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=
als, especially retirement.=20
This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have=
 faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =
up lost ground.=20
* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=
e who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street=
 analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=
gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20
Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=
mselves as "experts" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =
strategy at all.=20
Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=
on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that=
 wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=
nous, scale.=20
People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=
ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=
tfolios in the long run.=20
Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into=
 aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =
the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech=
 stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=
n.=20
* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=
talism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=
me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=
erve more capital.=20
Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=
der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much=
 worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =
for another year instead of failing when they did.=20
But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=
f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed=
 a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =
that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to=
 1997 "should not be relied upon."=20
Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=
d managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=
are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =
than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=
ticular sector.=20
These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=
y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20
The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=
rices.=20
Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =
ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =
the weak global economy. That's lousy for OPEC, but it's great for every en=
ergy consumer.=20
* The market's woes have altered many investors' priorities for the better.=
 The wild bull market of the late 1990s demanded peoples' attention, and go=
t it.=20
For some, stocks became an obsession. Their portfolios dominated their live=
s, especially if they were actively trading shares. They believed they were=
 going to be rich, or richer, and that it was all because of how smart they=
 were.=20
Now, most people have been humbled by the market. In the process, some have=
 realized that they don't want their mood determined by their portfolio's d=
ay-to-date price changes.=20
The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, of course, also changed many peoples' view =
of what truly matters to them.=20

INVESTING James K. Glassman
Don't Be A Pudd'n'head, Diversify
James K. Glassman

Warren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,=
 is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, "Too much of =
a good thing can be wonderful." In the market, such a motto would lead you =
to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=
ou really, really like.=20
Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=
ury, calls spreading yourself too thin "diworseification."
Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=
d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're ou=
t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=
f interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=
y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like=
 that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =
as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=
ur portfolio is modulated.=20
The reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=
uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=
e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=
ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =
of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=
hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =
investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something=
 stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=
ing that first disastrous year.=20
Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=
s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=
rill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to=
 pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =
up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=
ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1=
.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=
tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=
ng about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in w=
hat are called "concentrated portfolios." In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=
s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=
s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets.=
=20
If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=
, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=
o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called=
 Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but=
 $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20
It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.=
 As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=
he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-s=
tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report=
 from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined durin=
g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=
9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall's seven=
th-largest holding.)=20
"This fund has had a wretched existence," wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=
apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCal=
l's "faith may turn out to be well placed over time," Kapoor said. Unfortun=
ately, time ran out.=20
My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=
ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=
re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=
fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty=
 was touted as a "long-term capital appreciation" fund, not a sector fund. =
Here, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to.=20
The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=
nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=
choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=
ut that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=
ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=
zel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=
nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=
strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20
For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=
h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=
tfolio. This is called market, or "systematic," risk. Over the past 75 year=
s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=
t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =
has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=
n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=
d a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =
you have to live with it.=20
What you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=
ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=
id what is called "idiosyncratic," or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =
few stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=
s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=
stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =
wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =
sharply.=20
Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=
ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =
that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down=
 to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group =
found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =
more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=
u need to own more of them.=20
But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=
Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=
he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=
p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=
oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=
enanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell.=20
One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=
ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=
ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=
nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=
sk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=
t's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =
are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=
letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=
unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and=
 the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=
n 16, at last count.)=20
There are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain.=20
In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =
Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain'=
s Pudd'n'head Wilson: "Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=
t basket!" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=
tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=
une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20
We all make mistakes. (It was Twain, after all, who pointed out that "human=
 beings are the only animals that blush -- or need to.") But smart diversif=
ication helps investors avoid some of the worst of them.=20

Wessex Water `to be sold'

Wessex Water, the water and sewage company, is understood to be up for sale=
 following an offer to take over its owner, Enron, by Dynegy, the US energy=
 group.=20
Three years ago, Enron spent pounds 1.4bn on Wessex Water. But Dynegy is un=
derstood to want to concentrate on US and European energy assets and is not=
 interested in non-core assets.
Any hope to regain the same amount of money could be derailed as the indust=
ry is put off by regulatory problems, and the company's results have worsen=
ed due to imposed price cuts over the past year.=20
"It is not that there is going to be a fire sale but most of [the internati=
onal assets] are not core to the businesses we will continue to pursue," sa=
id an Enron spokesperson. "At the right price we will sell."=20
Scottish & Southern Energy and United Utilities have been touted as potenti=

 take a dim view of bids by UK water companies, as they are too large to bu=

Quanta Services, which builds and maintains power and communications lines,=
 said Friday it is fighting a "creeping takeover" by UtiliCorp United, one =
of the nation's largest utility holding companies.=20
On Thursday Quanta board members changed the Houston company's shareholder =

The action was taken after negotiations with UtiliCorp fell apart and the K=

A spokesman told Bloomberg News on Oct. 4 that UtiliCorp wanted to increase=
 its stake to the mid-40s percentage range, which would give it effective c=

UtiliCorp invested $320 million in Quanta from September of 1999 through Fe=

AT ENRON, THE BIG DOGS ATE FIRST

Summary: Workers' ire over 401(k) plans is understandable=20
Watching Enron's bigwigs lose their jobs after inflating profits may offer =
some satisfaction to retirees and employees at the troubled energy marketer=
. But don't bank on it.
When corporate insiders can sell the company and stroll away with millions =
while workers and other stockholders are left with peanuts, it would be har=
d not to be bitter.=20
As Oregonian business writer Jeff Manning reported Friday, local employees =
of Portland General Electric, an Enron subsidiary, watched their retirement=
 savings sink after Enron announced on Oct. 16 that it would lose $618 mill=
ion in the fourth quarter. This came after Enron officers made more than $1=
36 million selling stocks earlier in the year.=20
Then on Nov. 8, Enron dropped the other shoe: It admitted it had overstated=
 earnings for four years by $586 million, or 20 percent. Over those few wee=
ks, Enron shares plunged from $33.84 to its $9 close on Friday.=20
The four-year overstatement developed through some novel accounting methods=
. Enron and its auditor, Arthur Anderson, insist that its financial reports=
 were all within proper standards, but the mechanics in this case included =
obscuring debt by placing it on the ledgers of other entities so that the p=
arent company's profit picture appeared rosier than it actually was.=20
The weeks from mid-October to early November were wrenching for employees. =
Because the company was changing its fund manager, they were powerless to m=
ake any changes in their 401(k) plans. PGE chief executive Peggy Fowler poi=
nts out that the change in 401(k) plan managers was announced last summer. =
And although employees could have gotten out of Enron stocks over the histo=
ry of the plan, Enron seemed to be an attractive investment.=20
Company executives, though, were selling. Jeffrey Skilling, who was promote=
d to Enron chief executive early in the year but resigned in August, sold m=
ore than $5 million in company shares according to transaction records cove=
ring the first half of the year.=20
Former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, who was fired last month in =
an action related to the financial mess, made $14 million in stock sales be=
tweeen March and November of last year. Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executiv=
e, who returned after his protege Skilling left, made at least $20 million =
in stock sales from late last year. He has announced that he would decline =
his severance package.=20
Dynegy, another Texas energy marketing company, has made a bid to buy Enron=
. That probably means the best Enron and PGE employees can hope for now is =
that Dynegy will be a better corporate owner, or they can try their luck wi=
th one of the many shareholder lawsuits being filed.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's activities.=
 If its behavior was illegal, there will be consequences for company office=
rs.=20
That's still not much to offer to workers who have seen their retirement sa=
vings dissolve. But for now it's all there is.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling.
By BARRY RILEY.

FINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock=
 market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY=
 RILEY.=20
Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =
20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =
of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=
ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.
But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=
hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's big=
gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=
bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =
#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20
Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, we=
re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =
too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in "auction=
 theory" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=
tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G'=
s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy pr=
ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20
Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=
iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=
anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=
ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=
ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=
bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =
true risks at Enron.=20
Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?=
 The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =
on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.=
=20
Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =
of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=
l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=
ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=
TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=
tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =
at which point they were "safe" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=
k.=20
That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=
oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =
15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=
nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.=
 Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=
roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=
ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20
Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =
area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=
ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=
he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding=
 companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=
tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bu=
bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well=
 as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =
maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities=
 of new equity.=20
Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =
is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =
engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=
ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =
thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=
ich just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors t=
his year.=20
Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =
market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over=
 recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year=
 have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=
; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being=
 made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=
ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =
of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =
will really change.=20
The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed=
 many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=
ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=
r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are sti=
ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20
A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=
ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=
ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=
fter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=
h pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=
on packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=
fectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other=
 shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20
Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=
eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=
smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20
In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=
onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=
nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =
people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=
ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances
2001-11-17 11:06 (New York)

Enron Investors Hope Filing Will Shed More Light on Finances

     Houston, Nov. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. investors hope
the energy trader's third-quarter report to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that
sent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival
Dynegy Inc.

     Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly
explain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday's filing more
on how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, as
well as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves related
to Dynegy's $24 billion buyout.

     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects the
likelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing of
such a deal,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty
Utilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.

     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent in
three weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run by
Enron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such as
previously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit rating
and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.

     ``There's been so much skepticism about what Enron's
liabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantify
this,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery Asset
Management LP, which holds Dynegy shares.

     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failed
investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to
Dynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open with
investors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severance
package of more than $60 million that he could have collected
following the takeover.

     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell
$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.

                           Balance Sheet

     Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected last
week, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement of
earnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enron
reduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million to
include losses from affiliated partnerships.

     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheet
summarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balance
sheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its press
releases announcing earnings.

     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Lay
mentioned during a conference call last month that dealings with
two partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or its
assets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led to
the ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what
(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said Commerzbank
Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' and
doesn't own them.

     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, said
Louis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While the
balance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, which
were set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company's
books, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said.

     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''
Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''

                           Credit Rating

     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron's
legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``will
help us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong American
Utilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.

     Both companies are based in Houston.

     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``It
may say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencies
have told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst at
Williams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''

     Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut the
company's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy held
off on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating would
be cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash needed
to settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.

     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much it
will pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief Operating
Officer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profit
will be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. He
didn't give details.

     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the company
plans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unit
and operations in Europe, analysts said.

     Enron has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. and
about a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided between
London and Houston, where Enron employs about 7,500.

     Many Enron workers are already preparing for layoffs, said
Lyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & Struggles
International Inc., an executive placement firm.

     ``I got 56 resumes last week from Enron,'' Taylor said.
``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''

U.S. oil companies are setting up shop all over downtown, usually picking h=
igh-quality office space with lots of open space. Anadarko Petroleum Corp. =
is located at Fifth Avenue Place, Burlington Resources Inc. is in Bow Valle=
y Square and Devon Energy Corp. is in Canterra Tower. Some end up in the of=
fices of the companies they acquire. Conoco Inc. has moved into Gulf Canada=
 Square.=20
The big takeover wave has led to a reshuffling of downtown space. Today, th=
ere is a shortage of large spaces and an increase in small ones available f=
or sublease.
Some would like to get the towers they occupy named after them but landlord=
s resist this because naming a building after one tenant can be a disincent=
ive for others.=20
Oilmen's favourite hangout is the Calgary Petroleum Club, founded by U.S. a=
nd Canadian oilmen in 1948 in the Palliser Hotel. Members have reciprocal m=
embership at the Petroleum Club of Houston. But Calgary's Pete Club is a ba=
rgain compared to its Texas counterpart. The initiation fee in Calgary is $=
2,000, monthly dues are $65 and the minimum amount members must spend in a =
year is $600. The initiation fee for full membership at the Petroleum Club =
of Houston is US$3,500, monthly dues are US$110 and the minimum house accou=
nt is US$75 per quarter.=20
U.S. executives running Canadian oil and gas operations earn substantially =
more than their Canadian counterparts because their compensation is competi=
tive with the U.S. market.=20
When U.S. oil companies purchase Canadian operations, they like to keep as =
much of the Canadian staff as possible, since they are even more aware than=
 their Canadian rivals of the "war for talent."=20
When recruiting locally, U.S. firms pay competitively but of course will pa=
y what they must to get the best candidate. They also offer competitive ben=
efits and stock-option plans. U.S. employers gulp at the generous holidays =
enjoyed by Canadian oilpatch employees.=20
There's no American neighbourhood in Calgary, although many recent arrivals=
 are buying homes close to the city's core, particularly in such high-end n=
eighbourhoods as Mount Royal, Elbow Park and Britannia, where homes sell fo=
r $500,000 to $2-million.=20
Some U.S. companies purchase condominiums in such areas as Eau Claire on th=
e Bow River to house U.S. executives in transit.=20
Ted Zaharko, a broker-owner with Royal LePage, says Americans are driven by=
 lifestyle choices and the fact that they can afford to buy expensive homes=
. Living near other Americans isn't important.=20
The cost of living is lower in Calgary than in many comparable U.S. cities.=
 However, U.S. cities become more competitive for high-income earners becau=
se personal income taxes in Canada are higher than in the U.S. at the highe=
r income levels. Offsetting factors include access to health care, clean ai=

U.S. oil types may have strange accents -- many come from the southern stat=

WestLB Offers to Buy Enron's U.K. Water Unit, Newspaper Says
2001-11-17 20:01 (New York)


     London, Nov. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Westdeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, Germany's largest state-owned bank, is one of
several suitors talking to Enron Corp. about its Wessex Water
unit, which is valued at more than 1 billion pounds ($1.4
billion), the Sunday Telegraph said without citing sources.

     Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy Enron for $24
billion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.
WestLB made a formal offer to Enron in the past few days in hopes
of striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid the
regulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in the
U.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to the
Competition Commission, the newspaper said.

     Enron bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG of
Germany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interested
in Wessex, but Enron thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWE
bid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.
water company.

     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout for
Railtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s train
tracks and stations, the paper said.


Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon

     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. closed Wednesday
on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Salomon
Smith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its Transwestern
Pipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it had
received a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investment
banks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cash
reserves.

     Enron secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern and
the Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined are
about 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubic
feet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured with
the Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage and
is expected to close next week, Meyer said.

     Enron agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in a
transaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.
The move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company's
shares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federal
investigation of accounting irregularities that limited its
ability to finance operations.

     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company and
Dynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided Enron,
through Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday as
part of the buyout agreement.

     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights
in the Enron unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the merger
isn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire Northern
Natural Gas, Enron said in regulatory filing Wednesday.
ChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion after
the merger closes to maintain its equity stake.

     The shares of Enron fell 48 cents to $9, while shares of
Dynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47. Both companies are based in Houston.
Shares of San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco fell 35 cents to
$83.45.

I received a call from Portland General Electric (PGE) asking for assistance in posting an open season for them in regards to their Kelso-Beaver Pipeline.  The reason they are asking for assistance is that they currently do not have an electronic bulletin board.  I have attached a draft version of their open season.  The plan would be to utilize the Hot Tap platform for their posting.
 
Please advise if you have any comments regarding this issue.
 
Thank you.

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Rod,
    The view now is to minimize costs and move toward a sale of our A to B rights as a withdrawn partner to WMB or TCPL, or we may negotiate a deal that would allow us a back in intertest if we pay a promote at a given point in the future. Either way we will limit further funds from going out the door. 

Dan

Pam:

As a follow up to our call today, please obtain a specific date that we can expect the TV monitor set-up.  It would be a shame to install cable and TV set-up and move in the next month.  

Also note that I have not heard from Iain regarding options on the table top desk copier.  Please advise status and date of expected delivery.

Thank you for your assistance.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

I received these comments this afternoon from JPMorgan.     I need to have some help putting together a story to counteract the basics of this story from CERA.

Importance: High


Rod:

As we discussed here are the bulletts that summarize what we heard from our consultants.

Overall demand picture

Believe it will be 2006 before the California market will get back to 2000/2001 demand levels

          2002            demand down approximately 900 mmcf/d
          2003            demand will be flat
          2004            growth in demand will begin
          2005-2006   return to 2001 demand levels

Reasoning:
   2001 was a dry year - the lack of hydro generation created an additional 600 mmcf/d demand for gas in California
   Anticipated generation capacity overbuild in California - new more efficient power plants with better heat rates will displace older gas fired generation, reducing the amount of gas              required to generate a MW of electricity on the margin
   California electricity rate increases have curtailed demand for power and subsequently, gas

Gas transmission capacity into the state

Over the next two to three years there will be an additional 2.0 Bcf/d of transmission capacity into California
   800 mmcf/d in 2002
   900 mmcf/d in 2003 (Kern River expansion)
   300 mmcf/d               (El Paso conversion of All American oil line and power up)

San Juan basin gas

San Juan basin production is declining

   first half of 2001 vs. first half of 2000 production off by approximately 200 mmcf/d
   Rockies gas will not replace declining production in the San Juan San Juan gas will move closer to Permian pricing


The consultants believe that the combination of these factors will put decontracting pressure on existing transmission into the state of California, and especially the El Paso and Transwestern lines.

However, the "wild card" in their view is unforeseen California power demand growth.

As we discussed, JPMorgan would like to hear your views on the above issues.

Please give me a call when you have had sufficient time to digest and we can set up a conference call to make the most efficient use of your time.

Thanks Rod

Brent

Also, when you have had a chance to look at sales gas volume growth please
e-mail the volume numbers to me...thanks

Danny, 
I received three letters stating that since I am no longer with Enron I can access and move my savings plan.  These three letters, no one but three is very upsetting right before Christmas. I was going to call you but I hate to brother your hoilday.  I pray this is a huge oversight but yet I received three letters. I will call Gary and Fran on Wednesday hope that they are in the office and can assist me.  Happy holidays.

Hello Bill,

As I mentioned in the phone message, we're still working on achieving favorable pricing for our heat recovery proposal at Transwestern's Station 1 near Kingman, AZ.  In addition to revising our cost estimates for the proposed configuration, we are also considering adding generating capacity to achieve greater efficiencies.  The results of our efforts will be forthcoming in a few weeks.

In the meantime, would you be so kind as to please review the attached draft term sheet and provide general (and, of course, non-binding) comments regarding the usefulness and acceptability of the terms listed and identify any terms we missed?  Since we pipeliners aren't really in the power business, we wrote this mainly from scratch and would appreciate some feedback as to whether we're even close to an industry standard for this type of project.  Thanks in advance for your time.  I don't mean to be a pest, but I would really like to see this sensible idea evolve into a functioning and reliable power plant.  Please don't hesitate to call with questions.

Sincerely,

John

DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER


I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Danny,

We're planning to go to West Virginia for Christmas.  Depart after work on Friday 21 Dec and return on Sunday 30 Dec --- I think those are the right dates.  Let me know if I need to make adjustments --- I can return earlier.

Frank, Steve, Charlie, Robin, Greg and Maria:  CONGRATULATIONS on an outstanding result!  I don't think I've ever in my days as an outhouse and inhouse lawyer worked with a team that was so cohesive and effective.  That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

Enron Shares Fall on Concern Over CFO's Partnerships (Update4)

     (Updates with Chief Financial Officer Fastow didn't
immediately return a call for comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares have
fallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggest
energy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chief
financial officer contributed to investment losses.

     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board cost
the company at least $35 million by allowing Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,
partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder alleged
Wednesday in a lawsuit.

     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billion
in third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall Street
Journal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with the
two limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equity
by $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from the
partnerships, the paper reported yesterday.

     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at John
Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you are
someone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time to
punt with Enron.''

     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or written
requests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return a
telephone call for comment.

     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 million
last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital
increases on an investment of about $3 million in one of the
partnerships, the Journal reported today.

                        Buying Enron Assets

     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies and
partnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,
based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.

     The foreign business corporations and limited liability
companies have directors, officers or managers whose address is
listed as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,
according to Texas records.

     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member in
each one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enron
assets, including foreign power plants.

     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managing
member, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt last
year.

    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to use
the proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other
``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants or
companies since 1999 and sold four.

     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests about
Fastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of the
value of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or company
executives at Enron's expense.

     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen
69 percent this year.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron stock sustains further heavy losses.

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

(New first paragraph, adds additional analyst comment) 
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock sustained further heavy losses on Friday as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite was rocked by reports about the company's relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer. 
The energy giant's stock closed down $2.95 or 10.2 percent at $26.05 per share, making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in over four years. 
Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. 
"I don't think this thing passes the smell test," said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I think the CFO should be out of there right now. In the interest of the stockholders, that CFO should be gone," he said. 
Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. 
POOR JUDGMENT? 
Analysts said that at the very least, the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron, which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August. 
"For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors," said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. "It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron," he said. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year, when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. 
The stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. 
This year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured, Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO, and the company's Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payments dispute. 
Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non-core businesses, including broadband and water services. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings. 
Analysts said Enron's credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead. 
"What don't we know that went on at that company? Where's the credibility?" asked one frustrated analyst. "We don't know if it's limited to this," he said.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A Beating
By Michael Rieke

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) hype and skyrocketing share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business.
Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom. 
The company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the third quarter of last year, the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 million. 
Enron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included severance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs, loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enron's content services. 
At an analysts meeting Oct. 16, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is "not that robust" right now. Industry revenue is low and there's substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market, "more than even we anticipated," Lay said. 
The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners. 
"A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into," he said. "Others thought so, too." 
Looking back, Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital, Lay said. It spent "too much too soon." 
An Ominous Comparison 

He compared Enron's move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won't be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron. 
Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadband in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-lasting headache than broadband. 
Maybe Enron's surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers. 
It's trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year, he said. It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business. 
Meanwhile, the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in, he said. 
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs. 
At one time, they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard, Whalley said. Now they "wouldn't want to forever be in the network business." 
Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets. 
The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation. "Intermediation" is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses, said an Enron spokeswoman. It's a combination of trading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers. 
More Bad News Expected 

Rebecca Followill, a research analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter. 
"If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen, you've got to figure that their assets' values have fallen similarly," Followill told Bandwidth Beat. "I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in broadband." 
Another analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron. "To the extent that they can take more writedowns, I think it would make eminently good sense to do it." 
He predicted "a $200 million haircut" in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue. 
And that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broadband property, plant and equipment at the end of last year, he said. They had another $600 million of risk management asset receivables, inventories and working capital items. 
Followill doesn't see much future in broadband for Enron. 
"I think the business will shrink to the point where it won't be shown as a key sector in their reporting," she said. 
Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds, she said. Her investor clients don't expect broadband to contribute to Enron's earnings within the next three years. 
She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy. 
The other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. "It doesn't look like there's any right now, to be honest," he said. "They'll carry the trading operation to some degree."

Dynegy Chief: Bandwidth Growth Won't Wait For Trading
By Erwin Seba
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

10/19/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth sector has reached its bottom and is recovering. 
But those critics don't understand his bandwidth business, Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don't understand how the business world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said.
In announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday, Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event, be it of natural or human origin. That's what's driving the recovery, he said. 
Also, businesses will avoid travel, he said, relying instead on video conferencing. 
Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn't seen any signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering, in part, because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with, he said. 
"They're trying to find trading partners for broadband," Watson said. "That's going to be tough to do." Dynegy isn't concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isn't "a realistic model" for it yet, he said. "I said two years ago it was at least two years away. I still think it's probably at least two years away, before we actually call it a trading commodity." 
The metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks, which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity, Watson said. 
It's unfortunate that Enron's model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market, Watson said. Dynegy's model includes telecom contracts, negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply of bandwidth. 
Dynegy's bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past several months, they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy's customers. The goal has been to build a customer base. "We're looking at being an intermediary, and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today." 
Since Dynegy lit its 16,000 route-mile network two weeks ago, the trading desk has been trying to fill the company's network instead of buying bandwidth from others. "I'm trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements," Watson said. 
He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. "They have offices that never talked to each before," he said. "Now they've got to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable." 
ChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy, said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids. 
The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications, the corporation's telecommunications unit, is $20 million to $25 million a quarter, Watson said. In the third quarter, it lost $15 million, down from $20 million in the second quarter. 
Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. 
"If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that's what we need really," he said. "If we can get there by the end of next year, I'll be very happy. I think by '03, this market will have righted itself." 
Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy. 
"Dynegy is an energy company," he said. "Our energy merchant company is doing very well and business is growing like a weed...(Telecommunications) is not our core business by any stretch right now. But I'd love to be able to tell you it's going to be. I'd love to be able to tell you it is someday."

UK: Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out.
By Amanda Cooper

10/19/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchange members' profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts. 
The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of high-profile companies to withdraw from the market, casting a pall over next week's yearly LME Week industry gathering in London.
Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks, raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work. 
"Good people can always be placed. As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire," Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment group Exchange Consulting said. 
"Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets, people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies." 
Last week, ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member, unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor, prompting around 25 job losses among traders, phone jockeys and clerks. 
Then blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New York base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact, but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process. 
In the same week, the LME's largest floor trader, Enron Metals, said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group . 
SECURITY 
With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time, competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security. 
"What we're finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record, which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they're keen to stay put," Gilley said. 
"So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years, they are now staying for three to five years. 
"They probably feel that they're reasonably safe where they are, they're well recognised and not going to stick their necks out," she said. 
BONUS FEARS 
October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences 
Also, traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bonuses, which are usually announced at the end of the year. 
"Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of year, people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don't think any of them are anticipating good bonuses. They're probably just happy to have a job," Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said. 
LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi-tech and telecomms stocks. 
Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients, and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market. 
Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal. 
"A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it, " Gilley said. 
"The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing," she added. 
As for morale in the industry, individuals' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed. 
"Just because I've lost my job doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Porsche," one trader said.

New Power Hldg Sees Meeting 3Q Loss Estimate

10/19/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Holding Inc. (NPW) expects to meet its prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement with Enron Corp. (ENE), lowering the collateral New Power must post under a master netting agreement. 
In a press release Friday, New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact and cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.
The company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. 
Analysts put the company's third quarter loss at $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Third quarter revenue will be "slightly lower" than the $60 million to $65 million forecast in August, New Power said. 

In the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.19 million. 
The amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the master cross-product netting, setoff, and security agreement, and expands through Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the Enron units. 
Under the amended pact, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. 
Shares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67, up 1 cent, or 0.6%, on early composite volume of 7,900 shares. Average daily volume is 223,800 shares.

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.
"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow billions of dollars, pay no inte=
rest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then wait for the debt to simply dis=
appear. That was the promise of zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companie=
s from Enron to Merrill Lynch binged on what seemed like free money.=20
But, of course, there was a catch: For this scenario to play out, a company=
's stock price had to rise sharply--and quickly. That's because investors b=
ought the bonds in the hope of converting them into equity--if the stock ta=
nked, the bonds would no longer be worth converting. So to make them more a=
ttractive to buyers, companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stoc=
k price failed to rise sufficiently, investors could "put" (that is, sell) =
the bonds back to the company--in many cases, after just one year.
And that's exactly what's about to happen--to the tune of some $65 billion =
over the next three years. Stock prices have fallen so far that for at leas=
t half of these special hybrids, the prospect of conversion is now absurd. =
It simply won't happen. So bondholders are looking to get their money back =
the first chance they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible=
. Suddenly companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on the hook fo=
r billions of dollars in debt and interest they thought they'd never have t=
o pay.=20
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies. After all,=
 they're the ones who are going to be picking up the tab when all that debt=
 comes due. Huge chunks of cash will disappear from balance sheets to repay=
 bondholders. Companies without enough cash-- and the majority fall into th=
is camp--are likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when they borrow =
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at risk are inv=
estors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime candidates for killer r=
efinancing costs. Some companies may even be forced to issue stock to pay o=
ff the debt, creating significant shareholder dilution, especially at curre=
nt depressed prices. To make matters worse, this is happening at a time whe=
n the economy is barreling downhill and corporate profits are already shrin=
king. "This is a ticking time bomb," warns Margaret Patel, manager of the P=
ioneer High Yield Bond fund, a top-performing junk fund.=20
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000, when the stock market started=
 to falter. Companies in search of capital balked at the thought of selling=
 stock while their share prices were struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bo=
nds presented an attractive alternative because companies didn't have to ma=
ke cash interest payments on the bonds (hence the name "zero"). Instead iss=
uers offered an up-front discount--for instance, investors would buy a bond=
 for $700 and collect $1,000 when it matured.=20
Companies also gave investors the right to convert the bonds into a fixed n=
umber of common shares. But the bonds were structured so that conversion wo=
uld make sense only if the stock price rose significantly--in many cases, b=
y more than 50%. With that protective feature (called the conversion premiu=
m), zeros took off. Corporate issuers would pay no interest, and once their=
 stock prices had climbed back to acceptable levels, the debt would be swep=
t away into equity. "If the bonds are converted, it's a home run for everyb=
ody," says Jonathan Cohen, vice president of convertible-bond analysis at D=
eutsche Bank.=20
That four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price rising. If=
 it doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy put feature, can simply=
 sell the bonds back to the company. Great for bondholders, but not so hot =
for the company or its shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that ha=
ppening? "CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go u=
p," says Cohen. "They don't worry about the bond getting put."=20
If all this seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A real-life e=
xample should help. California-based electric utility Calpine issued $1 bil=
lion in zeros in April to refinance existing debt. At the time, the company=
's stock was trading at about $55 a share--severely undervalued in the opin=
ion of company management. "We really didn't want to sell equity at that po=
int," says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of finance. So the co=
mpany instead opted to sell zeros, setting the conversion premium at a heft=
y 37%.=20
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that had to rise si=
gnificantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds weren't exactly a scre=
aming buy for investors. So Calpine added the put feature: Investors could =
sell the bonds back to the company after one year at the full purchase pric=
e, eliminating any downside risk.=20
Things haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The stock has si=
nce plummeted to $25, and it now has to triple before conversion makes sens=
e. So it's looking as though Calpine will be liable for the $1 billion in b=
orrowed money when investors get the chance to put the bonds this April. Th=
ere's also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's borrowing ra=
te could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra $85 million per year in =
cash. "Obviously, nobody plans for their stock to go down," Kelly says. "I =
don't think there was one person around who thought the bond would be put."=
=20
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high because its credit rating i=
s straddling junk. "If you are a borderline investment-grade company, a fin=
ancing of this nature is not necessarily the most appropriate thing in the =
world," notes Anand Iyer, head of global convertible research at Morgan Sta=
nley. The problem is, there are a slew of companies with far worse credit r=
atings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit Suisse First Boston's head of convert=
ible-bond research, estimates that about half of all zeros outstanding fall=
 into the junk category. And others are at risk of having their ratings dow=
ngraded before the put date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 per=
centage points above bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a pri=
cey proposition.=20
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit by the high =
price of junk. It has $845 million in zeros that it will probably have to b=
uy back this January, and another $4.2 billion coming down the pike over th=
e next couple of years. Because of slower- than-expected sales, the company=
 was recently put on negative credit watch by three rating agencies. And if=
 Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide into junk status, =
a situation that could cost the company--and its shareholders--tens of mill=
ions of dollars in refinancing charges.=20
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these zeros. Comp=
anies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their bonds--up to 3% of th=
e amount raised. If the debt is sold back, many will have spent millions fo=
r what essentially amounted to a one-year loan. "They're getting bad advice=
," claims one banker who didn't want to be named. "Look at the fee the bank=
er earned and look at the kind of financing risk the company got into."=20
As if those potential consequences were not scary enough, shareholders can =
also get whacked when the bonds are first issued. That's because some 40% a=
re bought by hedge funds, which short the company's stock (sell borrowed sh=
ares with the intention of buying them back at a lower price) at the same t=
ime that they buy the bonds. If the stock goes down, the shorts make money =
from their position. If it goes up, they profit by converting the bond to s=
tock. This hedging strategy almost always causes the stock to plummet, at l=
east for a while. Grocery chain Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% o=
f its market cap the day it announced it was issuing $185 million in zeros.=
=20
Despite all the pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna bonds continu=
es, thanks in large part to the slick tax and accounting loopholes they pro=
vide. In fact, the hit on earnings per share can be the lowest of any form =
of financing. Even better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies c=
an rake in huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're act=
ually paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small amounts of interest=
 if certain conditions prevail. Verizon Communications, for instance, would=
 pay 0.25% annual interest on its $3 billion in zero bonds if its stock pri=
ce falls below 60% of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,=
 oddly, that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest deduction=
, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on its regular debt. (Wh=
y? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That adds up to an annual deduction o=
f more than $200 million, even if Verizon never shells out a dime in intere=
st. Not surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued in 2001 contain si=
milar clauses. "It's an incredible deal for them," says Vadim Iosilevich, w=
ho runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment Management. "Not only are they=
 raising cheap money, they're also doing tax arbitrage."=20
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies continue to issue =
zeros at a steady clip: According to ConvertBond.com, seven new issues, tot=
aling $3.5 billion, have been sold since Oct. 1 alone. "I think the power o=
f the tax advantage is going to keep them around," says CSFB's Seidel. Call=
 it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will recover quickly--it =
doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the shareholders who'll be left pay=
ing the bill.=20

Manager's Journal: What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of=
 age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Luc=
ent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (=
CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky busin=
ess. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a p=
roposed fire sale to Dynegy.=20
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron becam=
e a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conf=
licts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with=
 schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mi=
rage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation.=
 We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is n=
eeded. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norm=
s. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh re=
velations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that h=
ave enduring value.=20
-- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric p=
ower industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of biddi=
ng by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. En=
ron was the leader in pioneering this business.=20
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is =
spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consume=
rs, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition fo=
rce the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experie=
nce of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the powe=
r industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.=20
-- Innovation and the "de-integration" of power contracts. Under the old re=
gulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a o=
ne-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible a=
nd inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure =
by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the e=
xact needs of the customer.=20
To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent=
 parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered c=
ustomers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did t=
oo, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguabl=
y, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the "=
process of Creative Destruction." But creative destroyers are not necessari=
ly likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today.=20
-- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logi=
c of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for i=
nstance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amou=
nts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate ac=
tivities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrat=
ed firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from burea=
ucracy and the captive nature of "customers" and "suppliers." Enron envisio=
ned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the=
 bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal =
operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by whic=
h divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy=
 for the economy.=20
-- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment=
, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pi=
peline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a nu=
mber of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competiti=
on, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies.=
 Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they cou=
ld nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any mome=
nt in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules =
to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tre=
mendous value for both customers and suppliers.=20
-- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easil=
y have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the tradi=
ng risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron=
 pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among th=
e best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron =
made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential =
to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and =
ability to deliver.=20
The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by =
the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to fi=
nance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfoli=
os are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thi=
ck equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than tra=
ding risk, that destroyed the firm.=20
-- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporat=
e culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a ut=
ility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excu=
ses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years=
 ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean,=
 fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving it=
s professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, an=
d transfer within the firm.=20
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an ope=
n-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture=
 was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a l=
arge corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning =
rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more =
hide-bound enterprises to emulate.=20
Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformatio=
n of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the bu=
siness economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in=
 which it did business. It thrived on volatility.=20
The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establis=
hment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following E=
nron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming ant=
itrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enr=
on's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prospe=
rity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake thei=
r industries.=20

J.P. Morgan Wins (by Not Losing as Much)
By Susanne Craig
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You know things are bad on Wall Street when the winner of a stock-selection=
 contest can't come close to breaking even.=20
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s portfolio was the only one in The Wall Street Jou=
rnal's quarterly stock-picking survey to slide less than 10% during the thr=
ee months ended Sept. 30. The value of its stock basket fell 8.6% during th=
e third quarter.
Just six of the 15 financial firms managed to beat the benchmark Standard &=
 Poor's 500-stock index, which dropped 14.7% during the period. Among the s=
tar performers that came to J.P. Morgan's rescue: Northrop Grumman Corp., S=
BC Communications Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co.=20
"It has turned into a real stock-picker's market," says J.P. Morgan equity =
strategist Douglas Cliggott. "In the first half, the market bought cyclical=
 stocks, such as credit cards and brokers, in hopes of a recovery. We don't=
 think those stocks will get interesting until sometime in 2003." Instead, =
the firm's portfolio is weighted toward health care and consumer staples, a=
s well as cyclical stocks such as energy and farm equipment.=20
The quarter was among the roughest in years for Wall Street investors. The =
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 helped contribute to the stock-market losses,=
 which drove down the value of all portfolios in the survey, though the mar=
kets have since recovered to their pre-Sept. 11 levels. The last time the g=
roup posted results this bad was during the third quarter of 1998, during t=
he Asian financial crisis.=20
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Credit Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Bost=
on finished at the bottom of the pack, falling 23.2% and 30.1% respectively=
. The performance of last-place finisher CSFB was dragged down by losses at=
 companies such as Veritas Software Corp. (down 72.3% in the quarter), Prae=
cis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (down 64.8%) and software provider Amdocs Ltd. (do=
wn 51%).=20
For CSFB, "it was not a good stock-picking quarter, that's for sure," says =
Al Jackson, the firm's global head of equity research. "It was our tech and=
 telecom . . . and the events of Sept. 11 that hurt us."=20
Credit Suisse First Boston recently changed the approach to its model portf=
olio, opting against sector weightings, Mr. Jackson says. This strategy has=
 hurt CSFB in recent quarters, because of the steep slump in areas such as =
technology and telecom. The firm recently added a number of Old Economy sto=
cks to its portfolio, such as Citigroup Inc., Dow Chemical Co. and Gannett =
Co. Says Mr. Jackson: "We are going back to our roots and asking what our b=
est ideas are."=20
Like CSFB, Goldman was hit by a drop in the share price of technology compa=
nies, such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (down 56.5% in the qua=
rter). Its portfolio was also dragged down by shares of embattled Enron Cor=
p. (down 44.3%). Morgan Stanley and Royal Bank of Canada's RBC Dain Rausche=
r, which placed 6th and 12th respectively, also have the energy company on =
their lists.=20
In addition to Enron, stocks hard it by the terrorist attacks, such as lodg=
ing giant Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., Walt Disney Co. and air=
lines such as Skywest Inc., also hurt the portfolio performance of many sec=
urities firms.=20
It is unlikely people will buy any company's entire recommended list at one=
 time. The Journal survey is intended to give investors an idea of how thei=
r portfolio would look if they let the professionals do all the picking. Ca=
lculations in the quarterly survey, done for the Journal by Zacks Investmen=
t Research in Chicago, take into account capital gains or losses, dividends=
 and theoretical commissions of 1% on each trade.=20
Overall, Edward D. Jones & Co., of St. Louis, emerged with the most consist=
ent results across the board, placing second in the quarter and for the yea=
r. Its 85% return over five years is the best of the group and ahead of the=
 total return for the S&P 500 of 62.7%. Perhaps more than any other firm, E=
dwards Jones takes a buy-and-hold approach to investing, making very few ch=
anges to its portfolio from quarter to quarter, or even year to year.=20
"It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare, and we believe slow and s=
teady wins the race," says David Otto, Edward Jones director of research. "=
We are really, really proud of the five-year number. We believe in getting =
rich, slowly."=20
On a quarterly basis, the portfolio of Prudential Securities Inc., a unit o=

German Bank Is in Talks With Enron To Buy a Unit
By SUZANNE KAPNER

11/19/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 6
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LONDON, Nov. 18 -- A large German bank is in talks to buy Wessex Water from=
 the Enron Corporation, people close to the discussions said today.=20
Enron is looking to sell Wessex Water, of Britain, as well as other noncore=
 assets in India and Brazil, after a financial crisis nearly brought its ma=
in energy trading business to a halt. That crisis led to Enron's decision e=
arlier this month to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival.
The German Bank, Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Dusseldorf, or Wes=
tLB, is among several suitors for Wessex Water, people close to the discuss=
ions said. The sale has also attracted the attention of industry rivals lik=
e Thames Water, owned by RWE of Germany. But such a combination would most =
likely incur a long review by regulators, who might either block the merger=
 on antitrust grounds, or exact stiff concessions, industry experts said.=
=20
Wessex Water is likely to be sold for more than $:1 billion ($1.4 billion) =
but less than the $:1.4 billion that Enron paid for it in 1998, analysts sa=
id.=20
''In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses,'' =
Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, told analysts in a co=
nference call last week. Those investments ''have performed far worse than =
we ever could have imagined,'' he said, citing the Azurix water business, o=
f which Wessex Water is a part, and energy assets in Brazil and India.=20
Executives from Enron were not immediately available for comment today. Wes=
tLB executives declined to comment.=20
WestLB has been aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Britain, bidding for =
British Telecommunications' phone network and the nation's railway tracks c=
ontrolled by the troubled Railtrack, which is restructuring under governmen=
t supervision. Neither of those bids has progressed beyond the initial stag=
es.=20
Last summer, WestLB helped finance the management buyout of the Mid Kent Wa=
ter Company through Swan Capital, its private equity vehicle.

Credit Markets
Bond Boom Isn't Likely to Lift Economy As Corporations Swap Old Debt for Ne=
w
By Jathon Sapsford

When AT&T last week completed the second-biggest bond sale in history -- ca=
pping one of the busiest bond periods in years -- it came as welcome news a=
mid fears of a credit crunch. Here was new money, meaning new spending on p=
lants, equipment and jobs that could help pull the economy out of its slump=
.=20
That $10.9 billion AT&T deal, and a slew of similar bond deals from big com=
panies ranging from Boeing and Anheuser-Busch to Kraft Foods and General Mo=
tors, may not provide as big of a boost as economists are banking on. That =
is because corporations, like homeowners, are in the midst of a refinancing=
 boom.
Corporations are hitting the market not just because rates are cheap, but b=
ecause they often can't get money in other crucial markets. In particular, =
they are sidestepping the commercial paper market -- short-term corporate I=
OUs used to finance day-to-day operations, where rates traditionally are lo=
west -- because investors are unwilling to finance many well-known corporat=
ions.=20
The result has been a huge jump in bond sales, the majority of which are us=
ed to reduce existing debt. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, about $13=
5 billion in investment-grade bonds have been sold, up from about $78 billi=
on in the year-earlier period. Overall issuance this year is likely to set =
a record, clearing $600 billion, compared with $411 billion in 2000.=20
"The driving force behind this surge in bond issuance is refinancing short-=
term commercial paper to long-term debt," says John Lonski, chief economist=
 at Moody's Investors Service, a credit-rating agency.=20
Usually, rising bond issuance presages economic growth. In 1991, corporatio=
ns sold a record number of bonds to exploit falling interest rates. But the=
n, companies poured much of the money they raised back into their operation=
s, a flurry of investment that foreshadowed the economic boom of the late 1=
990s.=20
This time around, the surge in bond deals won't pump in enough new money to=
 the economy to make a dramatic difference. Though, as in the case of the m=
illions of homeowners who are refinancing their mortgages to lower monthly =
payments, it could help ease some pressure on stretched corporate-balance s=
heets and help to fund some of the companies' day-to-day operations.=20
Not all of the money being raised is to refinance short-term debt, of cours=
e, and the string of bond deals shows that many of the nation's biggest bor=
rowers have ready access to funding if they need it.=20
But most companies are similar to AT&T, which last week provided the bigges=
t refinancing example yet.=20
Over the next three months, the telecom company was facing $6.5 billion in =
expiring commercial paper. Under normal conditions, corporations pay off ma=
turing commercial paper by "rolling over" that debt, or issuing new commerc=
ial paper to replace the old. But rolling over commercial paper became much=
 harder for AT&T after Moody's cut the company's short-term and long-term c=
redit ratings. Through the bond deal, AT&T raised money at relatively attra=
ctive rates while avoiding the difficulties of the commercial-paper market.=
=20
Other companies facing downgrades also are scrambling to find alternatives =
to the commercial-paper market through bonds, loans or revolving credit lin=
es. "The ripple effects of this are being felt throughout the capital marke=
ts," says Meredith Coffey, senior vice president at Loan Pricing Corp., a d=
ebt-market-analysis company.=20
For the most extreme cases, the bond markets don't offer refuge. Enron, ham=
mered by a third-quarter loss of $618 million that led to a string of downg=
rades, drew down $3.3 billion from its emergency bank credit line to repay =
investors in its commercial paper. It then turned to its banks for an addit=
ional $1 billion loan to pay off more commercial-paper investors, thus tidi=
ng it over until it could merge with rival Dynegy.=20
Most investment-grade companies aren't nearly so bad off, and thus have rea=
dy access to bond investors. General Motors, for instance, had little troub=
le selling $6 billion in debt last month, while Ford Motor easily sold bond=
s totalling $9.4 billion.=20
But the surge in bond sales masks signs that even investment-grade companie=
s are having trouble convincing investors that they are good for their mone=
y.=20
Take Ford. Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Ford's debt ratings las=
t month to triple-B-plus and single-A-3, respectively. With that rating, Fo=
rd is far enough down the spectrum of investment-grade debt that many of th=
e ultraconservative investors in commercial paper won't touch it, meaning t=
hat it had to turn to corporate bonds to refinance its debt. Ford concedes =
that a big reason it is selling bonds was to avoid the trouble in the comme=
rcial-paper market.=20
Boyce Greer, the money-market group leader at Fidelity Investments, says he=
 often stops buying the commercial paper of a corporation at the first sign=
 of eroding profitability -- even before they get downgraded. "You can't wa=
it around for a rating agency [to downgrade a company]," he says.=20
Moody's has downgraded five times as many corporations as it has raised so =
far this year. Thus, the market for corporate commercial paper has shrunk t=
o $1.4 trillion at the end of October, down from $1.6 trillion at the end o=
f last year.=20
---=20
Friday's Credit Markets=20
Last week was a brutal time to own Treasurys. The market sold off so sharpl=
y as to push yields, which move inversely to prices, almost back up to wher=
e they stood before the terrorist attacks. It was the worst bond selloff si=
nce 1987, according to economists at Banc One Capital Markets.=20
Losses were heaviest in issues like the two-year note, the most sensitive t=
o expectations about Federal Reserve policy. Since hitting a record low of =
2.30% on Nov. 7, the two-year yield has risen 0.80 percentage point to 3.05=
%. In the same period, the 30-year bond yield has risen 0.50 percentage poi=
nt to 5.27%.=20
At 4 p.m. Friday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 1 3/32 point=
s from late Thursday, or $10.94 per $1,000 face value, at 100 25/32. Its yi=
eld jumped to 4.897% from 4.756% Thursday.=20
The 30-year Treasury bond's price fell 1 19/32 to 100 25/32 to yield 5.317,=
 up from 5.211% Thursday.=20
Why the selloff? People in the market cite a shift toward the view that the=
 U.S. economy may finally be on the brink of recovery. That means the Fed m=
ay not need to employ many more rate cuts to get growth back on track.=20

Enron Corp. investors hope the energy trader's third-quarter report to the =
Securities and Exchange Commission will answer some of the questions that s=
ent its shares tumbling and led to a proposed sale to rival Dynegy Inc.=20
Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearly explain how it make=

y the company and affiliated partnerships, as well as any planned job cuts =
and other cost-saving moves related to Dynegy's $24-billion buyout.
Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67% in three weeks amid an SEC=
 investigation into partnerships run by Enron executives. Investors worry t=
hat new disclosures, such as previously unreported debt, might threaten Enr=
on's credit rating and scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bank=
ruptcy.=20
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay acknowledged last week that failed investments a=

Enron shares fell 48 cents Friday to close at $9 on the New York Stock Exch=

COMPANIES & FINANCE INTERNATIONAL - Dynegy bid faces long wait.
By NANCY DUNNE and ANDREW HILL.

11/19/2001
Financial Times
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved

Dynegy's $9.8bn rescue bid for Enron, the larger rival energy group, poses =
complex and unprecedented regulatory challenges for the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission (Ferc), which is likely to lead the review of the bid.=20
Officials from the two Houston-based companies, which announced the deal 10=
 days ago, estimated the regulatory process would take six to nine months t=
o complete.
But the Ferc review could take longer, according to experts, and approval o=
f the deal is further complicated by such issues as the parallel Securities=
 and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's finances.=20
"It's very complicated. It will be very time-consuming," said one person cl=
ose to the Ferc commissioners. As of Friday, the groups had not yet filed f=
or Ferc approval.=20
"(The deal) raises issues that have never been considered before by Ferc," =
said Edward Comer, general counsel to the Edison Electric Institute, the as=
sociation of US electric utilities.=20
"It has never considered the merger of two huge marketers, and in the past,=
 marketing wasn't considered as significant a portion of the energy sector =
as it has become."=20
A typical deal now takes about 200 days to win Ferc approval. But Mr Comer =
said approval of the Dynegy bid could take anywhere from six months to two =
years.=20
The agency's guidelines prohibit mergers if they give the new company the m=
arket power to push prices above competitive levels for "a significant peri=
od of time".=20
It analyses market power by identifying the products sold, the customers an=
d suppliers affected and market concentration.=20
"Mergers in the past have been considered on the basis of assets," said Pat=
ti Harper-Slaboszewicz of Frost & Sullivan, a market research and consultin=
g firm. "The rules were written when the industry was vertically integrated=
."=20
Now the question is how ownership of energy trading services will be calcul=
ated. It could be difficult to assess if the companies are exerting market =
power because information on the trading books of companies such as Enron a=
nd Dynegy is closely guarded, she said.=20
The two companies must also win consent from either the Justice Department =
or the Federal Trade Commission, and from states where the companies have p=
ipelines and provide retail services.=20

Fund Track
Russia Fund Surges Amid Global Woes
By Victoria Marcinkowski
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C17

Everything is relative in the investing world, so with U.S. investors nervo=
us about homeland stocks, European and Asian markets sagging and terrorism =
worries abounding, Russia's risky markets seem less so these days.=20
So far this year, Pilgrim Russia Fund, which was bought by ING Groep NV lat=
e last year, has been the top-performing regional mutual fund, gaining 53%,=
 according to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. By comparison, the Standard & P=
oor's 500-stock index has slumped nearly 14%.
Of course, the risks in Russia remain. Despite recent economic gains, the c=
ountry still is struggling with a weak banking system, inadequate state ins=
titutions to enforce contract laws and few businesses run by the "modern" r=
ules of corporate governance, according to Samuel Oubadia the 37-year-old m=
anager of the Russia fund.=20
"But they are getting more open," Mr. Oubadia said, though Russia's lax fin=
ancial reporting standards are still one of the main roadblocks for foreign=
 investors. With $49 million in assets, the Pilgrim Russia fund invests bet=
ween 90% and 95% in Russian stock, with the balance held in cash.=20
"While the global economy is slowing, Russia is still in an expansion mode,=
" Mr. Oubadia said. After years of economic reforms, consumer spending is u=
p 10% and the former Soviet Union's gross domestic product is expected to g=
row 3% to 5% next year, more than twice as much as that of the U.S. and Eur=
ope.=20
Two-thirds of the fund's stocks are oil and gas companies, which are still =
the most liquid stocks in Russia. Utilities, mining, telecommunications com=
panies and breweries make up the rest. "There's no escaping oil and gas if =
you want to manage a Russia fund," Mr. Oubadia said.=20
The spike in oil prices earlier this year made the investment in oil worthw=
hile, propelling earnings growth for Russia's oil and gas companies. Higher=
 oil prices also worked wonders for the Russian economy, which is largely d=
ependent on oil and gas. More recently, however, falling oil prices have th=
reatened the companies' profit growth.=20
But the fund manager, who is based in The Hague, said he doesn't think peop=
le should invest in Russian oil stocks because of their earnings prospects.=
 "You don't invest because of earnings growth -- there will be none for Rus=
sian oil companies this year. You invest because of the stocks' low valuati=
on," Mr. Oubadia said, adding that most of the Russian oil companies still =
trade well below the world-wide average for the sector.=20
Yukos Oil is one of the fund's largest investments, making up about 12% of =
the fund's holdings. Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil Holdings also make up more t=
han 5% each of Pilgrim Russia's assets. While Mr. Oubadia said the companie=
s should be able to handle falling oil prices, partly by cutting production=
, he worries that further price erosion could hamper a fragile Russian stoc=
k market that relies so heavily on oil and gas stocks.=20
"Can Russian markets do well with lower prices for oil?" he asked. "The sho=
rt answer is yes. But how low will prices drop?" Mr. Oubadia acknowledged t=
hat weak oil prices might cause him to shift some investments from oil and =
gas into other Russian sectors, including telecom stocks and consumer produ=
cts.=20
The Russia fund isn't for the timid. In 1998, when the Russian economy coll=
apsed, the fund -- then called Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, lost 83% of =
its value. A year later, the fund soared 160%. In 2000 the fund finished do=
wn almost 18%.=20
---=20
JANUS STOCK SHUFFLE: Janus Capital Corp. bulked up on lower-priced value st=
ocks and shed some shares of its long-held technology companies during the =
third quarter, a new Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed.=20
The Denver fund firm reported that during the third quarter, it lowered its=
 investments in 14 of the 20 largest holdings it had owned as of June 30. T=
he largest reduction was a 43.6 million-share sale of Nokia Corp. stock. Af=
ter the sale, Janus still owned a large 183.2 million-share position in the=
 wireless-phone company at the end of the third quarter.=20
During the quarter, Janus also sold more than half of its stakes in tech co=
mpanies EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. In addition, the fund company, =
a unit of Stilwell Financial Inc., trimmed its exposure to energy company E=
nron Corp., selling 1.5 million shares to reduce its overall position to 41=
.4 million shares at the end of September.=20
On the buying side, Janus, one of the hottest fund firms of the late 1990s =
thanks to bets on leading technology stocks, about doubled its position in =
software company Microsoft Corp. It also boosted its holding in the investm=
ent company run by Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., while starting =
a small position in Philip Morris Cos., whose dividend-rich stock is usuall=
y more popular with price-sensitive "value" managers. Janus has introduced =
new value portfolios recently, but most of its investors' assets still foll=

NEW YORK - Companies that trade with Enron Corp., the Houston, Texas-based =
energy group, are taking precautions in case Dynegy Inc., also of Houston, =
withdraws its $15.6-billion rescue bid for its rival, a decision that could=
 trigger a crisis in the energy trading market.=20
Counter-parties to Enron, which is one of the principal market-makers provi=
ding liquidity in the energy market, are seeking to limit their exposure to=
 the group, in spite of reassurances from both Enron and Dynegy that the ta=
keover will go through.
Experts also say the implications of the deal are so complex that the regul=
atory review could take much longer than the six to nine months company off=
icials have estimated.=20
Analysts say the 27% spread between the value of Dynegy's offer price and E=
nron's share price suggests a 65% to 75% chance the bid will succeed. But b=
ankers and energy executives are still worried about systemic risk, both in=
 the energy market and in financial markets, where companies such as Enron =
use derivatives to offset the risk of energy price fluctuations.=20

Blackout in the power sector
A V Rajwade

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, t=
he most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL=
). This apart, the experience of investors in the "reformed" power sector i=
n Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to ado=
pt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission =
and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Commit=
tee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well.=20
Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe i=
t helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set i=
n Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the =
experience has not been consistent all over.
Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom deci=
ded to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the owner=
ship and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the vari=
ous operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilde=
ringly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an in=
dependent regulator.=20
Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor mana=
gement, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious ac=
cidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The "reform" d=
id not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month.=20
What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeedin=
g? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully sep=
arated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generat=
ion. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating compa=
ny, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea an=
alysed in this paper on August 27, "The policy and regulatory framework was=
 inadequate and myopic."=20
Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the=
 companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defa=
ulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn=
 defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are =
now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical p=
urposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, pe=
rhaps beyond redemption, and the "reform" is a total mess.=20
The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is=
 less efficient than trifurcated companies it is the political unwillingnes=
s to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cr=
oss subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the househol=
d and the agricultural segments.=20
However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started movi=
ng to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An "independent" =
regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic =
prices but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, puni=
sh power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is c=
ut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, =
sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for subst=
antive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to =
get out!=20
Enron too wants out but it has many more problems in its home country, over=
 and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publici=
ty for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (se=
e World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enr=
on's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic tra=
ding platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversificat=
ion in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's=
 exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilli=
ng, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts.=20
To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $=
1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial act=
ivities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge =
of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated=
 with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enr=
on's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some repo=
rts that Shell may make a bid for Enron.=20
After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anx=
ious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has=
 become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are=
 the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this =
is the optimum time.=20
But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved,=
 and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decisi=
on-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal do=
es take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It i=
s much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and De=
lhi to allow the drift to continue, to "let the law take its own course", w=
hatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian polit=
icians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....

Dec. 28
Beginning at 5:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will remove domain controllers CORPHOU-DCARD02 and CORPHOU-DCARD03 from service to be rebuilt.  These are just two of the numerous active domain controllers within the Corp domain.  There should be no disruption of service as user requests should automatically be redirected to an active domain controller.  Once these servers are rebuilt, they will be returned to the Corp domain.

Dec. 31
>From 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will move ECTHOU-HR1 to the Ardmore data center.  This move will result in a total disruption of service for those HR users whose S:\ drive is mapped to this server.

Jan. 7
>From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

Gary made it sound like you had decided to lose Micheal. For my money, I think if we kept Micheal, we could get rid of all of our analysts and associates, and still handle our development deals and sales.

Per Megawatt Daily, Crystal River has finished refueling and is at 50%.  They don't mention the FPL facilitiy.  Energy Trader shows the status unchanged for both.

Since the NRC is not published the status, any anecdotal evidence from anyone would be appreciated.

Nigeria LNG Signs MOUs With Enron, Iberdrola

10/03/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  LAGOS -(Dow Jones)- Nigeria LNG Ltd has signed memoranda of understanding
with Enron Corp. and Spanish power company Iberdrola for the sale of LNG
volumes from the 4th and 5th production units of its expansion program, NLNG
said in a statement released here Wednesday.   

  Nigeria LNG plans to commence production from the two new units in 2005.
However, it needs firm sales agreements accounting for all the production from
those units before it will finalize the invesment.
  The latest deals bring to 6.5 BCM/year the LNG volume from units four and
five already committed. Each of the new production units will have capacity of
4 BCM/year.   

  Nigeria LNG and Enron had earlier signed an MOU for 1 billion cubic meters
per year for the expansion program, also known as NLNG Plus volumes. The
second agreement raises Enron's share of NLNG Plus volumes from 1 BCM/year to
4 BCM/year.   

  Spanish and North American receiving facilities are the primary destinations
for LNG shipments to Enron under the new agreement, the statement said.   

  Iberdrola, which signed an MOU for 1.5 BCM/Year, will receive its shipments
at the Spanish receiving terminal of Huelva.   

  Jean-Francois Capelle, General Manager, Commercial, of Nigeria LNG Limited,
said MOUs will soon be signed for the remaining volumes of LNG from these
units, and that work had already started on sales and purchase agreements to
firm up these contracts. These may be signed by the last quarter of the year. 

  NLNG commenced commercial operation in October 1999 with its two-unit, 5.9
-million tons per annum Base Project. A third unit of similar design and
capacity as the Base Project unit is currently under construction and is
scheduled for completion in late 2002.   

  On completion of the NLNG Plus Project, NLNG will have an overall production
capacity of 17 million tons per annum of LNG and 2 million tons per annum of
LPG.   

  NLNG is a Nigerian Joint Venture company whose shareholders are the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (49%), Shell (25.6%), TotalFinaElf (15%) and
Agip (10.4%).

MESSAGE FROM GREG PORTER

________________________________________________
As you know, Transwestern filed a complaint against Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on September 28, 2001.  The complaint asked FERC to find SoCalGas' refusal to pay the tariff commodity rate constitutes a violation of Transwestern's tariff and the 1995 Global Settlement.  SoCalGas filed an Answer on October 18, 2001.  In summary, SoCalGas' Answer stated:

1.	SoCalGas did not affirmatively agree to pay the stated tariff rate during the Global Settlement.  

2.	The commodity charge SoCal has been paying is consistent with the course of performance/conduct prior to, and after, the Global Settlement.  

3.	Since the Global Settlement has been in effect, SoCalGas has relied on the commodity/usage charges that Transwestern has billed.    

4.	SoCalGas claims they had been paying the appropriate rate and that Transwestern failed to include the correct rate in its tariff; such omission has created ambiguity and any ambiguity should be construed against the drafter of the tariff, Transwestern.

5.	If the Commission disagrees with SoCalGas and declines to reject the complaint outright, any retroactive billing adjustment should be limited to a six-month period.

6.	SoCalGas admits that a retroactive billing adjustment for the escalation factor for six months is reasonable and an escalation factor going forward for the remaining term of its Contract No. 8255 is appropriate.

In addition to the foregoing statements, SoCalGas provided that it, like Transwestern, was interested in resolving this matter through ADR.  Accordingly, we will be coordinating with SoCalGas and FERC's ADR group to explore possible ADR procedures.

We will advise as new developments warrant.  In the meantime, should you have any questions regarding this matter please do not hesitate to contact me at (402) 398-7406 or Maria Pavlou at (402) 398-7097.

I just read the order.  My congratulations  to each of you as well.  Job well done.  Now hopefully the Commissioners will issue an order consistent with the judges decision.  We all needed some good news!  By the way Drew you should probably come up with a better description of your past experiences than "outhouse lawyer".

That you guys did it with a group pulled together  from two firms as well as in house lawyers is doubly impressive.  We appreciate the long hours and sacrifices you all made to get  this thing ready and try it in such a short time period.  Your timing is impeccable, as having a little good news about Enron out in the marketplace is sorely needed right now!  Thanks again guys!  DF

Enron CFO's Partnership Had Millions in Profit
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A limited partnership organized by Enron Corp.'s chief financial officer, A=
ndrew S. Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it=
 did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.=20
The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms =
of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the=
 partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.
Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more=
 than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capit=
al increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, whic=
h was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.=20
The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investor=
s in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow =
as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicate=
s the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction =
early.=20
The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders an=
d analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putti=
ng the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron=
 shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing =
LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wach=
ovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credi=
t Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.=20
Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuou=
s time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming th=
e nation's biggest energy-trading company.=20
This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured bus=
iness initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $6=
18 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on inve=
stments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix =
Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million,=
 was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That terminati=
on also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as th=
e company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM=
2 deals.=20
At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%=
, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 =
a share.=20
Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document=
. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They=
 said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at help=
ing hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding source=
s of capital.=20
Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In la=
te July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron =
officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareho=
lders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been w=
ith the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managin=
g company investments.=20
Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now=
 helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe hi=
s relation to LJM2.=20
In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 =
million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants=
 and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a=
 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of ret=
urn at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a declin=
e in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related ener=
gy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target=
, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.=20
In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in "Raptor III," wh=
ich involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a se=
t price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron t=
o settle the investment early, "causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million cap=
ital invested plus $10.5 million in profit," the report said. The renegotia=
tion was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced L=
JM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indic=
ated.

Enron CFO Profited From Partnerships With Company, WSJ Reports
2001-10-19 01:00 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow realized profits through a limited
partnership that did business with Enron, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an internal partnership document.

     LJM2 Co-Investment LP, of which Fastow is a general partner,
made millions of dollars on transactions with Enron, the paper
said. Fastow and possibly a handful of partnership associates made
$7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in
capital increases on an investment of about $3 million in the
partnership, the paper said.

     Enron shareholder Fred Greenberg filed a lawsuit yesterday,
alleging that Enron's board cost the company at least $35 million
by allowing Fastow to manage partnerships that bought Enron
assets. Enron reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from
failed investments.


The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week

1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?
One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - =
news - commentary) , the German chemical maker, which has seen its share pr=
ice gain 10.4% since the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the st=
ock might be getting ahead of themselves.=20
Bayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand fo=
r Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of the compan=
y's overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year (and, accor=
ding to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its acquisition=
 of Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put =
the demand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S. sales of the drug=
 to be approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.=20
Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably won't add that much to Bayer's o=
verall revenues. The president has asked for $643 million for antibiotics t=
o combat bioterrorist attacks. While it's possible that sum will be increas=
ed, not all the money would be spent on Cipro.=20
Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Ci=
pro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some pressur=
e in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other m=
anufacturers.=20
On another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit relate=
d to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It was forc=
ed to withdraw the drug from the market.=20
Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's a re=
fuge for investors.=20
2. Losses at Twice the Price
You know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double =
the price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (IT=
WO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , the supply-chain software maker. After mar=
ket close on Tuesday, the company posted losses under generally accepted ac=
counting principles that amounted to $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for=
 the latest quarter, including all charges.=20
In other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share pri=
ce, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.=20
Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of=
 Aspect Development in March 2000.=20
To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2 =
typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordin=
ary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so bad: The compa=
ny met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3 million, or 13=
 cents per share.=20
Still, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock dow=
n 25% the day after they were reported.=20
3. Microsoft's Bag of Tricks
In times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as usual a=
t many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq - new=
s - commentary) is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a comp=
etitor.=20
It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the wo=
rds "Microsoft Server Crunch" to customers of rival server software maker N=
ovell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained "a number of false and mis=
leading statements" intended as putdowns of Novell products.=20
Among the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged food.=
 For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a line =
on the Microsoft boxes read: "What's the expiration date on that NetWare pl=
atform?" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly funny engi=
neers.)=20
The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consultin=
g services, which Novell says isn't true.=20
Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intende=
d to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. "It was all in the=
 theme of a mock cereal box," he said. "It was a modest campaign."=20
In response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter in =
September to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements, and=
 it's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For the re=
cord, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money da=
mages.=20
4. AMD's Feisty Pledge
CEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be too m=
uch to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical r=
ough edges cross the line into embarrassing.=20
Case in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devic=
es (AMD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which earlier this week reported a loss=
 for the first time in almost three years. The company, facing harsh pricin=
g competition from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , said its reven=
ue was down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for =
the fourth quarter.=20
Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to be =
extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference call, h=
e indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called "H=
ammer" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, "We feel that when th=
e upturn comes, we're going to kick ---."=20
Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders, mee=
t Mr. Reeves.=20
OK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But his=
 comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will look b=
etter when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime soon, =
what matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges notwith=
standing.=20
5. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat Style
Analysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - com=
mentary) rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produce=
d results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they cam=
e from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gott=
en even more unsettling.=20
To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted a s=
teep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop that =
its shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion.=20
In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to=
 the "removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares." According to a=
 report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased 55 million shares iss=
ued through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital, a partnership t=
hat until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.=20
TSC's Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy E=
nron stock.=20
Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it h=
ad expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet its acc=
ounting critics.=20
Enron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify e=
xactly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest revelation, to say=
 the least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility. Enron, whose=
 CEO resigned unexpectedly in August, had seen its stock fall 59% for the y=
ear leading up to its latest earnings release. Since then, it's dropped ano=
ther 12.6%=20


The New Power Company Revises Its Netting Agreement With Enron; Provides Fo=
r Receivables and Inventory Financing

PURCHASE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 19, 2001--The New Power Company ("New=
Power"), a wholly owned subsidiary of NewPower Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: NPW) t=
oday filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission reporting=
 that it has revised its master netting agreement with Enron North America =
Corp., Enron Energy Services, Inc., and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (togeth=
er, the "Enron Subsidiaries").=20
The amendment affects the Master Cross-Product Netting, Setoff, and Securit=
y Agreement (the "Master Netting Agreement") among NewPower and the Enron S=
ubsidiaries, and expands through January 4, 2002, the types of collateral t=
hat NewPower is permitted to post to the Enron Subsidiaries.
The effect of the amendment is to reduce, through January 4, 2002, the amou=
nt of cash collateral that NewPower is required to post to the Enron Subsid=
iaries. Under the amended Master Netting Agreement, the first $70 million o=
f posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of=
 $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivabl=
es and inventory of NewPower, valued at discounts specified in the amendmen=
t, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Pledging receivable=
s and inventory is consistent with NewPower's previously announced intentio=
n to secure asset-backed financing.=20
With the amendment and NewPower's cost reduction efforts, and absent a simi=
lar rate of decline in commodity prices or other significant events, NewPow=
er believes that it has sufficient financial resources to conduct its busin=
ess until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing, which will be necessar=
y upon the expiration of the amendment. NewPower has been and is actively s=
eeking to arrange asset-backed financing with other parties, although to da=
te no such arrangements have been secured.=20
The Company expects to meet its previous estimate of net loss and loss per =
basic and diluted share for the third quarter ended September 30, 2001. How=
ever, customer count and revenues are expected to be slightly lower than pr=
eviously forecast.=20
The Company will provide revised guidance for the fourth quarter 2001 and a=
n outlook for 2002 on its third quarter conference call scheduled for Thurs=
day, November 8.=20

LOBBYING
K Street's Top 10: The Shifting Lineup
Shawn Zeller

10/20/2001
National Journal
Copyright 2001 by National Journal Group Inc. All rights reserved.

How do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselv=
es in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners? Van Scoyoc Associates In=
c. does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to re=
tain them. Quinn Gillespie & Associates doesn't have a long client list, bu=
t it is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client. Greenber=
g Traurig, meanwhile, lured away a rival firm's top rainmaker-and his lucra=
tive book of clients.=20
These are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal=
's survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income f=
rom January 1 to June 30. The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same o=
nes as a year earlier: perennial powerhouses Cassidy & Associates Inc.; Pat=
ton Boggs; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Verner, Liipfert, Bernhar=
d, McPherson and Hand.
But two new players-boasting huge growth rates-are among the firms nipping =
at the heels of these top dogs.=20
Greenberg Traurig, which came in at No. 5 in National Journal's midyear 200=
1 rankings, had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying fi=
rms. According to PoliticalMoneyLine, which compiles a comprehensive annual=
 list of all lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig had the 35th-highest income =
during the first six months of last year.=20
And No. 7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie, another first-ti=
me member of the top 10. Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinto=
n White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie-a one-time adviser to Hou=
se Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas-the firm has seen its fortunes rocke=
t upward. Quinn Gillespie was No. 13 in the first six months of 2000.=20
In between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates, ranked at No. 6. T=
here has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc, which was No. 28 in fee income =
at the end of 1996, the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act firs=
t took effect.=20
Rounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams & Jensen; Wa=
shington Council Ernst & Young; and Barbour Griffith & Rogers.=20
National Journal ranks the top-10 lobbying firms every six months by tallyi=
ng the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the=
 1995 legislation. National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 to=
p firms in PoliticalMoneyLine's comprehensive annual survey.=20
With its $16.68 million in fees for the first six months of the year, Cassi=
dy & Associates continued to blow away the competition. The last time any f=
irm reported a six-month total larger than Cassidy's was during the first h=
alf of 1998, when Verner, Liipfert led the way. During the first six months=
 of this year, Cassidy & Associates received a massive fee of $1 million fr=
om the Taiwan Studies Institute, a think tank with close ties to the Taiwan=
ese government; Boeing Co. paid Cassidy & Associates $600,000; and Tiffany =
& Co. paid it $400,000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mine=
d in conflict-ridden areas of the world from entering the global market.=20
Despite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat, lobbying goes on, c=
ompany Chairman Gerald S.J. Cassidy said. "During difficult times, people c=
ome to Washington with their problems. During more-robust times, they come =
seeking opportunities."=20
But the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig. The fir=
m, which posted just $1.71 million in lobbying fees during the first half o=
f 2000, saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly $8.7 million this yea=
r. Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff, the conservative K Street move=
r and shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Last=
 year, Abramoff left his old firm, Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, an=
d brought $3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig. Preston Gat=
es, which was ranked in the top five during Abramoff's tenure, dropped out =
of National Journal's rankings this year. The lobbying firm's fees fell by =
nearly 50 percent.=20
Abramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig, billing $860,000 to t=
he Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, $500,000 to the Commonwealth of the=
 Northern Mariana Islands, and $300,000 to garment manufacturers that opera=
te in that U.S. territory. A few new clients also forked over big bucks: th=
e Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana ($440,000); Voor Huisen Project Management, =
a homebuilder with international operations ($300,000); and the American In=
ternational Center ($100,000). Despite initial concerns among some Greenber=
g Traurig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in, Abramoff insists th=
at his team of lobbyists has been "totally integrated" into the firm.=20
But Abramoff wasn't the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig's higher=
 earnings. Ronald W. Kleinman, a former State Department lawyer, persuaded =
Congress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Sect=
ion 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. Th=
is section of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban governmen=
t funds that are frozen in U.S. banks to compensate the families of three m=
en who had won multimillion-dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amen=
dment to the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act. The amendment allows victi=
ms of terrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U.S. list o=
f state sponsors of terrorism.=20
Greenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre, Carlos Alb=
erto Costa, and Mario M. de la Pena-three members of Brothers to the Rescue=
, a Cuban-American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida. The=
 three men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on=
 February 24, 1996. The families sued Cuba and were awarded $96.7 million i=
n damages by a U.S. District Court judge in 1997. The State Department oppo=
sed payment, but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill. Greenberg T=
raurig reported a fee of $4 million.=20
Fred W. Baggett, the chair of Greenberg Traurig's governmental practice gro=
up, said this was a one-time fee, but he added that the Cuban case "establi=
shed a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one-time eff=
orts in the future," and noted, "We have a few coming down the pipeline."=
=20
Baggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem b=
y the Palestinian group Hamas, and Americans who were used as human shields=
 in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. None of the Americans was killed, and=
 all were eventually released.=20
Taking the flip side of the mega-fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates, wh=
ich reported receiving no fee above $180,000. Nonetheless, the firm continu=
ed its steady rise. A key reason, said firm President H. Stewart Van Scoyoc=
, was the ability to recruit and retain clients. The firm signed up 34 clie=
nts between January 1 and June 30, while only nine out of 159 clients termi=
nated contracts during the period.=20
"We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a c=
ontract," said Van Scoyoc. "We make sure we're clear on the goals and objec=
tives, and in a typical relationship, we don't guarantee that we can do eve=
rything." The firm's $6.24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23 =
percent higher than its fees for the same period last year.=20
Quinn Gillespie's ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenb=
erg Traurig's. Quinn Gillespie's billings were almost $6.09 million at midy=
ear 2001, a 71 percent rise over the same period last year. The firm has on=
ly 34 paying clients, but the average fee per client-$180,000-is the highes=
t among the top 10. During the six months, the British Columbia Lumber Trad=
e Council paid a fee of $540,000 to Quinn Gillespie, while Enron Corp. paid=
 $525,000. The Canadian group hoped its high-powered lobbyists would win gr=
eater access for Canadian lumber in the United States, but U.S. tariffs wer=
e reinstated earlier this year. Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregu=
lation, particularly in California. Enron is a major creditor of Southern C=
alifornia Edison, the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shorta=
ges in California last summer.=20
Quinn Gillespie's staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to =
nearly 30 today. "We like to think we have a toolbox here-people who may be=
 Republicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit t=
he client," Quinn said.=20
Patton Boggs had fees of $10.26 million in the first six months of 2001, bu=
t that was just a 5 percent rise over the same period in 2000. Still, the f=
irm leapfrogged over Verner, Liipfert to capture the No. 2 ranking. Patton =
Boggs earned $360,000 from Russia's government-owned NTV television network=
, which was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when the gover=
nment took over the independent network and ousted its staff.=20
Akin, Gump also jumped past Verner, Liipfert to No. 3 in the rankings, post=
ing $9.48 million in fees-a 16 percent increase over a year earlier. Akin, =
Gump's biggest client was the troubled tire manufacturer Bridgestone/Firest=
one Inc., which paid just over $1.5 million in fees. Akin, Gump also earned=
 big money from AT&T ($800,000) and the Gila River Indian Community ($620,0=
00).=20
At No. 4, Verner, Liipfert saw the biggest drop in fees, taking in $8.84 mi=
llion in the first six months of 2001-down 16 percent from the same period =
in 2000. Verner, Liipfert lost lucrative contracts with Puerto Rico after t=
he government there changed hands last year. (See this issue, p. 3273.)=20
Rounding out the top-10 rankings, Williams & Jensen at No. 8 billed $5.68 m=
illion, a 12 percent increase over the first half of 2000, while Washington=
 Council Ernst & Young saw its fees drop 11 percent to $5.5 million. The fi=
rm fell four places to No. 9 in the rankings. Barbour Griffith & Rogers's f=
ee income was up 7 percent to $5.48 million, putting the firm at No. 10.=20
Falling out of the midyear top-10 rankings were Preston Gates-No. 6 at midy=
ear 2000-and PricewaterhouseCoopers, No. 7 last year. PricewaterhouseCooper=
s's billings were $5 million for the period, a 6 percent drop from the firs=

Houston entrepreneurs added to Texas Business Hall of Fame=20

The Texas Business Hall of Fame's annual awards ceremony Thursday night hon=
ored four Houston business leaders.=20
The event at the George R. Brown Convention Center put the spotlight on Wei=
ngarten Realty Investors Chairman Stanford Alexander; Compaq Computer found=
er and former Chief Executive Officer Rod Canion; retired Reliant Energy Ch=
airman and CEO Don Jordan; and Dynegy Chairman and CEO Chuck Watson.=20
This is the 19th year the nonprofit Texas Business Hall of Fame Foundation =
has honored the state's business leaders with a dinner and induction event.=
=20
As chairman of Weingarten Realty Investors, Stanford Alexander built the co=
mpany into one of the nation's largest publicly traded real estate companie=
s.=20
After serving in the U.S. Air Force, Alexander joined J. Weingarten, a Hous=
ton-based chain of 87 supermarkets. He later became an executive with Weing=
arten Markets Realty Co., an affiliated real estate firm that developed fre=
e-standing supermarket stores.=20
The firm later changed its name to Weingarten Realty. The Houston-based com=
pany is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.=20
Weingarten owns shopping centers, warehouses and other property in 17 state=
s from coast to coast.=20
Weingarten's notable developments in Houston include the upscale Village Ar=
cade near Rice University and the Centre at Post Oak, across from the Galle=
ria.=20
Rod Canion came up with the idea behind Compaq in 1982 after a trip to a lo=
cal ComputerLand store. Along with colleagues from Texas Instruments, Jim H=
arris and industrial designer Ted Papajohn, Canion envisioned a portable co=
mputer that ran all the programs that operated on the IBM PC.=20
By the next year, the company was producing the original Compaq luggable co=
mputer, a move that essentially created the modern PC industry. By 1987, it=
s fifth year, the company made business history by breaking $1 billion in s=
ales, the fastest pace ever for a corporate startup.=20
Canion left Compaq in October 1991 but continued to be active in other vent=
ures. In 1992, he founded Insource Technology Group, a consulting services =
and network engineering firm, and continues to serve as chairman.=20
Don Jordan has been in the forefront of Houston business and society for de=
cades. And even though he retired from the post of chairman and chief execu=
tive at Reliant Energy in late 1999, he has remained active in the city's g=
rowth and development.=20
Jordan was with Reliant and its predecessor Houston Industries for 44 years=
 and helped position the company for its eventual split between the company=
's regulated businesses, such as HL&P and Entex, and unregulated business t=
hat is now called Reliant Resources.=20
Jordan, along with his corporate rival Ken Lay of Enron, was instrumental i=
n the successful campaign last year to convince voters to approve the use o=
f public funds to build a new arena downtown for the Houston Rockets.=20
Jordan has spent a lot of time on the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo board =
and many other civic groups.=20
Chuck Watson has built Dynegy into one of Houston's leading energy companie=
s, but he is more well-known for his forays into the world of sports.=20
Watson established NGC Corp., Dynegy's predecessor, in 1985 and served as p=
resident until becoming chairman and chief executive officer in 1989.=20
Recently Watson was revealed to be the largest investor in the limited part=
nership assembled to put together the Texans, Houston's National Football L=
eague franchise. It begins playing next year.=20
Watson also owns the Aeros, Houston's American Hockey League team.=20
Watson's support was also pivotal to getting voters last year to approve th=
e use of public funds for the new downtown arena. Watson had opposed an ear=
lier deal to use public money to build the facility.=20
Watson has also been a strong supporter of Houston's bid to land the 2012 O=
lympic Games.=20
To date, the foundation has awarded more than $1.8 million in scholarships =
to students pursuing business degree at Texas colleges and universities.=20

Recession, Budget Cuts, Travel Fears To Subdue LME Week
By Mark Long
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- The many travails of the metals industry will dampen t=
he spirits of those who make it to the annual round of meetings and parties=
 at London Metal Exchange Week, which starts Monday.=20
In what is expected to be a much smaller group of delegates than usual, con=
versations will be dominated by fears of global recession smothering alread=
y-lousy demand, the increasingly pressing need for production cuts, and the=
 exit of several important participants from the metals business.
Cuts in companies' travel budgets and fears of flying are keeping many of t=
he usual attendees away from London this year, dealers and analysts said.=
=20
"Sentiment is going to be bearish, and we've just heard in the past few day=
s of people who were previously going to come along not coming, largely on =
their companies' advice," said Adam Rowley, an analyst at MacQuarie Bank in=
 London.=20
Indeed, a representative at another major bank said fully half of the guest=
s expected at its satellite activities have canceled.=20
Forecasts for base metals demand and average prices have been widely revise=
d downward in the past few weeks, particularly since the impact of the Sept=
. 11 terror attacks accelerated the world economic slowdown.=20
Just this week, Standard Bank ratcheted its expectations lower, with LME ca=
sh copper - a bellwether for the complex that's especially sensitive to ind=
ustrial productivity - seen at $1,350 a metric ton in December 2001, down f=
rom an actual year-to-date average in 2001 of $1,619/ton.=20
Producers are reluctant to cut copper output, and declining Chinese imports=
 and weak demand in the west mean there is still further downside potential=
 for copper, Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar said.=20
With demand for base metals slumping so sharply, eyes have been turning to =
the producers to make moves on the supply side.=20
In copper, analysts say U.S. producers are the most likely to cut back, as =
the recent strength in the dollar hits their bottom line the hardest. Howev=
er, a recent slump in energy prices has kept the wolves from the door so fa=
r for some producers in an industry that's energy-intensive.=20
Elsewhere, zinc is suffering from a supply glut that recently pressured the=
 LME three-month price to a 17-year low of $766 a metric ton.=20
The troubles of Australian zinc producer Pasminco Ltd. (A.PAS) will surely =
be a hot topic, following the company's move to voluntary administration du=
e to its large debt load, dealers said.=20
But aside from all the market concerns, the most worrisome topic will likel=
y be the recent succession of companies bailing out of or reducing their co=
mmitment to the metals business, market participants said.=20
In the past week, N.M. Rothschild & Sons Ltd. quit the base metals business=
 and ScotiaMocatta - the metals trading arm of the Bank of Nova Scotia (T.B=
NS) - removed itself from open-outcry ring trade at the LME. Earlier this m=
onth, Enron Metals said it would cut staff by 10%-20% in Europe, and all th=
ese moves follow Mitsui Bussan Commodities Ltd. ditching its market-making =
activities in the metals business earlier this year.=20
Who's next?=20
"It could be anyone," is the refrain from nearly all market participants su=
rveyed.=20

diction of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to adju=
dicate the US-based multinational's dispute with Maharashtra State Electric=

A division bench headed by Justice Ajit Shah decided to hear the matter at =
a stretch for a week beginning from December 11. The court permitted MERC m=
embers P. Subrahmanyam and Venkat Chary to be impleaded as respondents. The=

The multinational power giant had levelled certain allegations of bias agai=

DPC was allowed to amend its main petition in view of the allegations level=
led against Mr Deo and were asked to amend it within week.=20
In his affidavit replying to allegations of bias by the DPC, Mr Deo said he=
 was neutral in his stand as a MERC member.=20
The court has made it clear that when the hearing in the case commences, tw=
o intervening parties, US Exim Bank and a consortium of 11 offshore lenders=
 of DPC would not be allowed to make any pleadings. The court, however, sai=

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Brad,

Unfortunately, due to current operating conditions at Enron, neither Bob Hill nor I are able to be in Anchorage for dinner with the producers.  Please convey our regrets.  I'd appreciate a debrief at your convenience.

Subject:	Gas Logistics Update

Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.  My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.  I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.

I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.   You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.  At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.  As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future. 

With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.  I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.  I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.

Team Celebration.  First, I hope you can attend a celebration on November 29 at the Doubletree honoring the Gas Logistics team and the new Contracts/Capacity Release team.  The celebration will include food, games and prizes.  Alma Carillo will be sending out all the details.  
Holiday Luncheon.  Second, get out your recipe books and start cooking, because it's also time for our Gas Logistics Holiday Banquet on December 11th in ECN42C2 from 11:30am - 1:30pm.  I'll provide the ham and turkey and team members can sign-up to bring a covered dish.  Ricki Winters will send around a sign-up sheet to make sure that we don't end up with 10 green bean casseroles. 



Follow-Up Q/A

Can Employees still order computers from the Click at Home program?
As of today, the Click at Home program has not been cancelled.  The web site is working and eligible employees are able to place orders.

Regarding loans from the Saving Plan, is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?
For active employees, loan payment amounts will not change during the term of the loan, even if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the value of the account.

Does the company have any position on employee participation in class action suits?  
No.  The decision whether to participate in a suit is a personal decision and is unrelated to an individual's employment.

I have made inquiries about our information stored out on the network and on Outlook as was discussed this morning.  Regarding the deletion of these documents we are storing once the project winds down, if you are keeping emails and attachments in folders on Outlook they will remain on an offsite backup system for only 7 days.  In other words, after this project is over with you can empty the file of everything and be assured that 7 days later there will be no trace anywhere on Enron's system.

If, however, you have stored any documents in any feature of our network (this includes any Enron software package backed up on our servers) i.e., our private ANNGTC folder out on the P drive, we can empty the folder and delete everything or not, that information remains on a backup tape for 7 years.

This information was just furnished by our Houston IT group.

I will be out of the office tomorrow but please email me with any questions.

USA: Enron shares in stay in doldrums after downgrade.

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s share price hovered above seven-year lows touched in earlier trade Monday after Moody's Investor Service cut the credit status of its senior unsecured debt of North America's largest energy trader to two ratings above junk status. 
Enron, the largest electricity and natural gas trader in North America, also on Monday said it was in talks with banks to expand its credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks.
Enron shares were down $1.40, or 9.03 percent, to $14.10 on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier in the session trading below $14 for the first time since December 1994. 
Moody's also warned that it could cut the debt rating again, now downgraded to Baa2, as well as its rating for the Enron's commercial paper. 
Enron's credit-worthiness will have a direct affect on its day-to-day trading operations and its trading partners' perception of making good on trades. With a credit rating hovering above junk status, the cost of doing business will soar as trading partners look for increased collateral to back trades. 
Last week Enron shares lost almost $14 billion in market value as a series of piecemeal disclosures about the company's involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
Investors have fled Enron's stock in droves following disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by former chief financial officer Andrew Fastow in deals the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is now looking into for possible conflict of interest. 
Enron compensated its partners in this off-balance sheet structure with the promise of Enron shares, if the value of private investments in several of its units fell below a certain level. 
Many industry observers see Enron's request for additional credit, after the company tapped its banks for $3.3 billion last week, as a sign a weakness. 
"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation," said Carol Levenson, an analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

USA: US companies' credit quality to worsen-Moody's.
By Jonathan Stempel

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate credit quality is likely to grow much worse before it gets better, a leading credit rating agency said in a report issued on Monday. 
Moody's Investors Service said that in the third quarter, it put on review for downgrade its credit ratings for 122 U.S. companies. At the same time, it put on review for upgrade its ratings for just 22 companies.
That 5.5-to-1 ratio is far greater than the 1.3-to-1 ratio in the second quarter. 
In dollar terms, the situation looks more dire. Moody's warned it may downgrade $543 billion of debt, dwarfing the $66 billion Moody's said it may upgrade by 8.2-to-1. 
"Particularly in light of September 11, the fourth quarter will be particularly weak for credit rating changes," said John Puchalla, Moody's senior economist. "A wide excess of rating reviews for downgrade over upgrades in the third quarter suggests credit deterioration will persist at least into early next year." 
Rating reviews are significant because, unlike actual rating changes, they are not a "lagging" indicator, and suggest the future direction of corporate credit. Moody's normally wraps up its reviews within three months. 
U.S. corporate credit quality is falling for many reasons. These include the weakening U.S. economy, an inability of marginal companies to raise cash, debt-financed merger activity and fallout from the Sept. 11 attacks on such industries as airlines, insurance, and travel. 
For example, Moody's in July warned it may cut Comcast Corp.'s ratings after the Philadelphia-based company bid $44.5 billion for AT&T Corp.'s cable TV operations. 
Then last month, Moody's warned it may cut Chicago-based Boeing Co.'s ratings because of the attacks' potential impact on demand for commercial airplanes. 
In the third quarter, Moody's warned it may cut its ratings of 54 speculative-grade, or "junk"-rated, companies, and raise the ratings of just 11. For investment-grade companies, the gap was even more yawning: 68-to-11. 
And in the fourth quarter? Through Friday, Moody's warned it may downgrade 47 companies and raise a mere four. On Monday, it downgraded embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp., and put all of its ratings on review for another downgrade. 
Puchalla, however, said the decline could slow next year, in part because interest rates are low and companies are managing their balance sheets more conservatively. 
"Lower borrowing costs and slowing debt growth should reduce debt servicing costs, and fiscal stimulus from the federal government should boost business revenues," he said. "That is a positive for credit quality." 
The third quarter was the 14th in a row when corporate rating downgrades outpaced upgrades. The record is 19 quarters, set between 1988 and 1993.

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update1)

     (Updates with analyst comment in fifth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't get
low-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who will
demand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy trader
tries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.

     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' said
Sean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It's
likely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''

     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans from
Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calm
investors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock since
Oct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cash
every day to settle commodities transactions and to keep trading
partners.

     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank credit
lines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,
or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry into
related-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and
$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.

     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a little
desperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.
``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''

                       Sells Assets for Cash

     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bank
terms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can include
agreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt and
putting up assets as collateral.

     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two related
partnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plants
and similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy the
plants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt and
sales proceeds.

     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale of
Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest Natural
Gas Co. next year.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.30, or 8.4 percent, to
$14.10 in midday trading. Earlier, they touched $13.55, down 12
percent. The company's credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors
Service after it wrote down the value of its assets.

     The stock had tumbled 80 percent in the past 12 months.

USA: Enron shares drop despite further triage attempts.

10/29/2001

(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Enron shares slipped to a new six-year low in early trade as North America's largest natural gas and electricity trader said it was talking to banks about tapping additional credit lines to ease financial concerns that have sent its stock slumping more than 50 percent in the past two weeks. 
Enron's shares were trading down 90 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $14.60 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares crashed through $15, a low not seen since February 1995.
Last week, Enron shed almost $14 billion in market value as its stock price tumbled more than half since last week, when a series of piecemeal disclosures about its involvement in complex partnerships began to trickle out. 
However, many industry observers see Enron's request for an additional credit after tapping its banks for $3.3 billion last week after as a sign a weakness not of strength. 
"We are not of the opinion that drawing down all of one's backup bank lines is a demonstration of financial strength, but instead ... it's an act of desperation," said Carole Levenson, research analyst with independent research firm gimmecredit.com.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a move to shore up investor confidence. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on a new credit line.
"We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
Enron shares sank 50 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $15 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. ((David Howard Sinkman, New York Newsdesk 646-223-6094)).

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy trading giant Enron Corp. said on Monday it is in talks with banks for additional credit, in a new move to shore up investor confidence after it tapped about $3 billion in credit last week, and to stop a plunge in the company's stock that set new six-year lows. 
Enron declined to comment on the size of the credit line, which banks it is in talks with and when it expects to complete an agreement on the new credit line.
Enron shares crashed through a psychological barrier of $15 a share, shedding $1.66, or 10.65 percent, to $13.85 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost more than half of its value in the past two weeks, losing more than $14 billion in market capitalization. 
"We want to restore investor and market confidence and nothing instills confidence like cash," said Enron spokesman Mark Palmer in Houston. 
Enron shares have tumbled since the company reported its first-quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16. The company also wrote down $1.2 billion in equity, including transactions with partnerships formerly run by its chief financial officer who was forced to step down from Enron last week. 
The sell-off was sparked by investor concern about the transparency of the transactions, which the Securities and Exchange Commission is examining. Enron last week replaced CFO Andrew Fastow as part of efforts to restore investor confidence. 
The Wall Street Journal reported Monday the beleaguered energy trader is negotiation with bank for a new credit line of between $1 billion to $2 billion to prop up share prices following last week's selling that sent shares plummeting. 
Enron said it drew about $3 billion in new credit lines last week, and has a net cash liquid position in excess of $1 billion. 
"Clearly, both the stock and bond market view Enron as being in dire straits," said independent research firm Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson.

POWER POINTS:Enron May Have To Rethink Asset-Light Focus
By Mark Golden

10/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- On the face of things, it's hard to understand the stock market's headspinning reaction to Enron Corp.'s (ENE) revelation of some bad news in recent weeks.
Why the talk of a "death spiral" for North America's premier energy trading company? The stock price of Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), for example, saw an almost identical drop over a similar 12-month period. Nobody questioned the viability of Cisco. 
The difference is that over the past few years, Enron has redefined itself as a company that runs on financial and intellectual muscle - not hard assets - and that focus is getting the company into trouble now that its credibility is in question. 
If you're buying network components, you can probably stand some ambiguity in the finances of your supplier. After all, you're buying something you can touch. But if you're buying power or gas, what you're really buying is a commitment to deliver. If your supplier doesn't come through when the market gets tough, you're left totally exposed. In Enron's energy trading business, then, credibility at every level is critical. 
For now, Enron looks to be more than viable. But the company's asset-light strategy might not be. Gross profits from trading have shrunk to 1.65% in the third quarter from 5.26% in the first quarter of 1998. Meanwhile, asset-heavy energy companies like Mirant Corp. (MIR) and Calpine Corp. (CPN) successfully use trading to optimize the performance of power plants and other infrastructure. 
Two weeks ago, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. That didn't send investors running, however. In fact, its stock price rose a bit on the news. 
What hurt was the disclosure that Enron had reduced its net assets, or "shareholders' equity," by $1.2 billion as a consequence of unwinding positions in partnerships headed by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. That, along with warnings of possible downgrades by credit ratings agencies and an inquiry by the Securities & Exchange Commission produced a $15.6 billion drop in Enron's market value. 
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service followed through by downgrading its rating on Enron's senior, unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, leaving it two steps above junk-bond levels. The agency kept Enron's ratings on watch for further downgrade. 
Long-Running Concerns 

A 50% hit to shareholder value still seems like an overreaction to a 10% reduction in shareholders' equity. The stock price reflects the expectation of additional losses to be reported and Enron's loss of credibility. Enron executives in a conference call Tuesday insisted that the worst was behind them, but few on the call believed that. 
For some analysts, Enron's revelations only fed long-running concerns about the company's lack of financial disclosure. 
Cary Wasden, managing partner of Reed Wasden Research, has had a "sell" recommendation on Enron since March. Unlike the analysts at big Wall Street firms, Wasden isn't in the business of selling stock. His firm isn't involved in brokerage and isn't a hedge fund. Wasden gets paid for his research, and the company doesn't invest in the securities it covers. 
A main Wasden concern with Enron is that the company has regularly included the proceeds from one-time sale of physical assets in operating income. His belief is that Enron has dramatically inflated its earnings for the past couple of years - a concern to which an Enron spokeswoman couldn't immediately respond. 
"Don't believe by any means this is the end of the story," Wasden said. 
Wall Street sell-side analysts have largely kept Enron as a "buy" or "strong buy" as the stock fell from $90 to $20. But even they are expressing concerns about the quality of Enron's reporting. 
For now, the plunge in the price of Enron's shares and bonds, which last week started trading like junk-rated debt, hasn't hurt its credit standing with energy trading partners. 
"We haven't changed our thinking regarding Enron or our policies and practices. We're watching it, and so is everybody else, but they are a solid company," Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) spokesman Richard Wheatley said in a typical reaction. "This is unfortunately a feeding frenzy regarding some dealings that I'm sure Enron will be able to come out of at some point." 
Keeping Talent A Challenge 

Enron is a big company - far too big to ignore. But continued deterioration in the price of its shares and bonds could lead counterparties to restrict their traders' transactions with Enron. If the company's investment-grade bonds continue to trade near levels traditionally considered distressed, risk managers won't be able to ignore it, whatever else Moody's does. 
Assuming that doesn't happen, Enron still faces a tough road ahead. Like all companies, Enron is the combination of capital and talent. For financial companies, talent is the more important ingredient, and Enron has been suffering damage to its talent for some time. 
New Chief Executive Jeff Skilling left in August, and a handful of his key lieutenants left earlier in the year. The losses can be expected to continue. Much of the top management cashed out when the company's stock price was high and moved on. Now middle management on down is angry and anxious to move on, if they haven't already. 
Over the years, Enron has compensated its very talented labor with stock options to make up for base pay considered low by the industry. Those options are now nearly worthless. If Enron's debt-service costs rise, the company could struggle to attract the talent needed to generate income in its core business of trading energy in North America. 
Some analysts would like to see more turnover at the very top. When Skilling left, nobody believed Skilling or Chairman Kenneth Lay's assurances that it was for "personal reasons." When CFO Fastow was forced out of his position last week, Lay said, "In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO." 
That's putting words in Wall Street analysts' mouths. Who thought scapegoating Fastow was really the answer? 
"I don't know anybody who said that," Wasden said. "What did the CFO do, what did Skilling do, that Ken Lay wasn't part of?" 
Real change will have to come from without, Wasden said. 
"Enron has been a cult, more than a company," he said. "Recruiting from within does nothing to change the company, it just changes the disciples. Enron needs to pull some top talent from outside." 
Nevertheless, Wasden thinks Enron's stock has reached its natural floor and, if the company starts disclosing how it really makes money, it can recover over time. 
"There are a lot of earnings that can be wrung out of really strong operating assets, like pipelines and power plants," he said. 
That means paying more attention to the assets that Enron has spent the past few years denigrating. Given the bind Enron is in, Lay won't have much choice. Enron will survive, but it won't be the same company at all.

OFFICIAL CORRECTION Enron long-term ratings downgraded to Baa2 - Moody's

10/29/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

(Moody's corrected its stance on Enron ratings to a downgrade) 
NEW YORK (AFX) - Moody's Investors Service said it has lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron Corp from Baa1 to Baa2 following a deterioration in Enron's financial flexibility since the company announced significant writedowns as well as equity charges in previously undisclosed partnership investments.
The long-term debt ratings remain on review for further downgrade, Moody's said. 
Moody's also placed the company's Prime-2 rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. 
Moody's initially placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct 16. The write-downs and equity charges led to a substantial loss in investor confidence that has led to a more than halving of Enron's share price and difficulties in rolling over commercial paper, according to Moody's. 
In response to these events, Moody's said Enron has shored up its near-term liquidity position by drawing down on all of its committed revolving credit facilities and buying back its outstanding commercial paper, leaving the company with a net cash position of approximately 1.2 bln usd. 
Moody's said it plans to focus on management's success in lining up further liquidity support and on their ability to retain credit availability from their major counterparties.

USA: Moody's cuts Enron to 2 notches above "junk".

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service on Monday cut embattled energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s senior unsecured debt rating to two notches above junk status, and warned it may cut that rating again, as well as its rating for Enron's commercial paper. 
The rating agency cut Houston-based Enron's senior unsecured debt to "Baa2" from "Baa1," and said it may cut Enron's "Prime-2" commercial paper rating, which affects short-term debt. Its rating actions affect $13 billion.
Moody's said Enron is suffering from deteriorating financial flexibility since it announced big write-downs and equity charges from previously undisclosed partnership investments this month. This triggered "difficulties in rolling over commercial paper," Moody's said. 
Enron, which has about $63.4 billion in energy assets, said on Monday it is talking with banks to get more credit, after last week drawing down $3 billion from a bank credit line to buy back its outstanding commercial paper. 
Its shares traded Monday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.75, down $1.75, or 11.3 percent. They have fallen 62 percent since Oct. 12, from $35.81. 
Rating agency, Standard & Poor's, on Thursday revised its outlook for Enron's ratings to "negative" from "stable."

UK: Europe energy firms wary of Enron on credit worries.
By Stuart Penson

10/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy companies in Europe are shying away from trading with troubled U.S. energy group Enron amid concerns about the company's credit status, industry sources said on Monday. 
Several large energy groups have frozen their dealings with Enron - one of Europe's biggest gas and power traders - as they hold urgent talks with the U.S. group about setting up new credit arrangements, the sources said.
"I think Enron's approach is to get the major counterparties back on board as quickly as possible and then hope the smaller ones will follow," said the head of risk management at one UK utility that halted its trade with Enron last week. 
"They are talking with us about bank letters of credit," he said. "The people that are still trading with them are doing so on a very restrictive basis." 
A spokesman for Enron's European headquarters in London headquarters declined to comment. 
Reluctance to trade with Enron in Europe comes as the company tries to rebuild investor confidence after its stock hit five-year lows. 
Triggering the slide was news last week the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating huge losses relating to a private equity operation run by its former chief financial officer. 
Houston-based Enron trades a large amount of its volume in the U.S. and Europe through its Internet EnronOnline system. 
Last Friday the company said trade on EnronOnline was above average levels with more than 8,400 transactions at a notional value of approximately $4 billion. 
Traders said Enron's plight could hit liquidity in European gas and power markets, where liberalisation has unleashed rapid growth in energy trading in the last couple of years. 
One industry source cited a brokers list showing eight companies in the UK electricity market had put on hold their trading Enron, which is among the biggest five traders in the market. 
In mainland Europe, where Enron has been a major driver of liquidity, potential counterparties are treading with care. 
"We are avoiding them as counterparties - either by not trading with them or by using a 'sleeve' (a third party trader)," said a senior trader at one of Germany's big utilities, who declined to be named. 
French traders said wariness about dealing with Enron had dampened liquidity although Enron was still in the market on Monday morning. 
"Enron is a major player so counter parties are looking to see if there is a problem," said one French trader.

BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Puts Spotlight Back On Broadband
By Michael Rieke

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Thanks to Enron Corp. (ENE), the broadband sector again looks like a place to make money.
But it won't be traders who will cash in on this new potential. It will be class-action attorneys. They're already lining up to sue Enron in at least five shareholder suits. 
As of Oct. 25, two of lawsuits had been filed against Enron in federal court and three more in Texas state court. Most of them name as defendants Ken Lay, Enron's longtime chairman, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling and Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer until he was put on leave of absence Oct. 25. 
Still another suit, which isn't a class action suit, was filed naming as defendants members of Enron's board of directors. 
All the lawsuits concentrate on private investment partnerships Enron set up, many of them managed by Fastow. Most of the suits contend that it was a conflict of interest to have the Fastow partnerships doing complicated hedging transactions with Enron. 
The transactions named in the lawsuits involved billions of dollars of underperforming assets in broadband, water and other Enron investments. 
Fastow operated on both sides of some of those transactions. As Enron's chief financial officer, he was being paid to manage the corporation's finances. As general partner of two LJM partnerships, he managed the counterparties to billions of dollars of trades with Enron. He shared in profits of those partnerships. 
When investors began demanding information about the transactions, Enron's share price began to slide. With the heat on, Enron recently unwound the trades with the partnerships and booked $544 million related to losses from early termination of the deals, among other things. 
That's when the class action attorneys went to work. So far, at least 14 law firms are representing the plaintiffs. Enron didn't respond to calls asking about the lawsuits. 
Among the law firms representing plaintiffs is Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which put out a news release announcing its lawsuit. The release points out that the firm has been responsible for recovering more than $30 billion from class action lawsuits. 
The lawsuits bring up questions about the bandwidth trading market. Some of the deals with the LJM partnerships run by Fastow "purportedly involved hedging transactions in the broadband market," according to Abrams and Franks v. Enron et al. 
That could tie into questions that have lingered in the bandwidth market for months. Market skeptics have said Enron and other energy companies are the only ones trading bandwidth. 
Enron has reported that it has been trading with a growing number of counterparties, a total of 120 in the second quarter of this year, according to Enron. 
Now market watchers will want to know if any of Enron's trades were done with the LJM partnerships managed by Fastow. 
They will also want to know how many bandwidth trades were done with Chewco Investments. That Houston company, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal, was managed by Michael Kopper and was set up in 1997 when Kopper was a managing director with Enron's Global Equity Markets Group. He left Enron earlier this year to work for partnerships run by Fastow. 
Do the plaintiffs' attorneys know whether Enron was trading bandwidth with any of those investment partnerships? 
"I think if is too early to tell," Thomas Bilek of Hoeffner & Bilek told Bandwidth Beat. "As you know, (information) is coming out in drabs and dribbles from Enron." 
It could be several months before plaintiffs' attorneys get a chance to ask Enron officials those questions, Bilek said. 
It's also too early to tell what potential damages plaintiffs could win, said Steven Schulman, an attorney with Milberg Weiss. "At this point, you can only talk about it in terms of (shareholder) losses, and the losses are in the billions." 
Total losses will depend on the price each shareholder plaintiff paid for the stock and the price at which each shareholder later sold the stock. 
Enron's share price topped out between $90 and $91 in the summer of last year. It set a 52-week low Oct. 26 at $15.04. That spread leaves plenty of room for losses. 
Schulman told Bandwidth Beat that the record for losses in shareholder cases is $11 billion in a case involving Cendant Corp. (CD). Damages are usually a substantial portion of losses, Schulman said. 
"Whether (the Enron case) is bigger or less, I couldn't opine," he said. "This is a big case, by any means."

Rod,
     I'll be somewhere between Pueblo and the Royal Gorge, but I'll try to stop and patch in. I trust that everyone already understands what is contracted and the only concern is our recontracting capability. Right?

Eric:

I spoke earlier today with the banker who led the TECO-Panda financing for Societe Generale (lead arranger with Citi on the $2.2 bill. merchant project financing).  Following is a summary of the call with healthy amount of detail since it may be some time before we have a chance to visit.  Due to confidentialities, Jim could only go so far on some details, so you'll note a number of gaps; however, this should cover many of your questions.  Call upon return after the holiday and we can discuss further.

Also attached - after notes - is an article that should capture many of the financing details.  Given other demands, I've not yet read the article so duplication between the notes and article is inevitable.  A word of caution - PFI details are good but not always accurate so rely principally on the call notes.  I also asked for portions of the Offering Memo. but am doubtful on receiving this.  Distribute further as you see fit.

Summary of Call
This was a merchant financing with both projects (Phoenix and El Dorado, Arkansas) cross-collateralized and x-defaulted - so treated as a single financing.  
Approx. 2250 MW per site for total of 4500 MW (with 4 separate units per site).
Sources of funding - Total of $2.8 Bill. ($2.2 Bill in debt and $600 MM in funded equity).  Apparently all of the $600 MM equity was funded at close June 01' [further confirmation is needed].  Of the $2.2 Bill. in debt, $1.7 Bill. was non-recourse and $500 MM was an equity bridge, with recourse to partners.  However, lenders looked principally to TECO's credit backed by several guaranty of equity bridge and fronting of the $600 MM in funded equity.
Partnership - 50/50 in all respects (ie. vote and economics).  However, TECO must have some preferential rights (eg. cash flows etc..) given their substantial commits on the deal.  
Term of debt - 2 yrs. construct facility plus 3 yr. mini-perm with bullet at maturity (approx. 8% amortized at maturity).  Five years is the market for merchant deals.  Amortization is 18 yr. mortgage style.  144 A expected form of permanent take-out of term debt.  
Leverage - 60% financed by term debt, but approx. 50% debt financed when adding all ancillary facilities and other commits (ie. working capital, letters of credit etc..).  Jim kept details to minimum but further info. is needed here.
Key Ratio was debt service coverage.  Base Case assumed an average DSCR of 3.40X and Min. of 2.40X with cash trapped at 1.75X.  Did not get detail on whether DSCR was both historical and forward looking, but suspect there was some kind of forward test.  Project finance banks typically expect 3.25 to 4.25 DSCR on merchant finance deals.
Leverage, DSCR and structure in general was done based on what is generally required to gain investment grade rating from agencies when permanent take-out is sought.  Additional rating agency requirements can be found on Moody's and S&P web sites.  
TECO also will act as operator.  TECO was clearly crucial to deal and at least Soc. Gen. had done prior deals with them (not sure about Citi).  Panda brought TECO into the deals.  Although Panda was a known quantity, Soc. Gen. had no direct project history with them.
Fuel and Power Off take - Lenders looked to extensive an Energy Management Program analysis.  The EMP presumed (by C.O.D.):  50% of fuel and power would be under firm contract, 25% of each would be covered by seasonal swing contracts and remaining 25% would remain merchant.  Intention is a complete match (term and volumes) for fuel and power contracts.  Agency agreements were signed with Noble (1yr. contract) on fuel supply mgt. and Aquilla (2 yr. contract) for managing power sales.  Each buys in name of the projects.  TECO is responsible for overall energy mgt. and coordination between Noble and Aquilla.  Jim said EOD is triggered if fuel and power agreements are not signed in line with E.M. Program by C.O.D.  Lenders got comfortable with lack of fuel and power contracts due to substantial equity commitment (approx. $1.1 Bill.).
Consultants were Pace for fuel supply and overall energy management and RW Beck for power market eval.
Fuel Transport - Much of medium term contracted at close (mix of firm and interruptible capacity) out to 7 yrs.  Lenders looked to new and released capacity to fill non-contracted needs.

Thanks for the quick response.  The objective at ETS is to arrange a long term gas transportation agreement with the Gila Bend project.  We estimate their requirements to be 386,000 MMBtus/day and understand that El Paso has agreed to provide 100,000 MMBtus/day.  Gila Bend is one of several potential strategic shippers for our project and we are extremely interested in the credit quality of their project, recourse to parents, etc.

Principle risks + mitigants to understand:
Gas supply arrangements
Gas transportation arrangements
Financing arrangements, sources of funds
Power off-take arrangements
Who is the Operator?
Ownership structure, decision-making, etc.
Financial recourse to parents

I spoke with the project bankers at one of the lead banks (principal underwriters) here in town.  They are scheduling a call for me with the banker who lead the deal on their side.  I will be asking about fuel supply issues, key risks, terms etc.  Forward any additional questions you have and/or provide more specific questions of fuel etc.. and I'll give it a go.  I also asked for the Offering Memo., which will be near impossible to get due to confidentiality issues but will let you know how it goes.  Let's visit about you attending as well.

Yes, I talked to him again this morning. He did not have the construction schedule, but he thinks it will be done this week. As soon as he calls to let me know it's done, I'll wheel the TV/cart down. I just did not want to have it down there unattached to anything -- things walk, you know. Anyway, thanks for the update. I'll let you know as soon as he calls me. Have a great week!

Good news, someone came by last week in regard to the TV cable but, he got away before I could introduce myself and ask about the installation and timing.

Please advise (a date) when we can expect both the TV monitor and desk top copier.  Thanks.

As a follow up to our call today, please obtain a specific date that we can expect the TV monitor set-up.  It would be a shame to install cable and TV set-up and move in the next month.  

Also note that I have not heard from Iain regarding options on the table top desk copier.  Please advise status and date of expected delivery.

Thank you for your assistance.

Stocks Close Higher As Investors Cheer Earnings News
By Peter Edmonston

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
The Wall Street Journal Online 
Stocks rallied sharply Monday despite the widening anthrax scare, as a batch of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports cheered investors.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 172.92, or 1.9%, to close at 9377.03 after gaining 40.89 points Friday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 36.75, or 2.2%, to 1708.06 after climbing 18.59 points in the previous session. 
Other major stock indexes gained ground Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 16.42 to 1089.90, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 7.13 to 561.45, and the Russell 2000 Index gained 4.80 to 430.50. 
Bonds were mixed and the dollar strengthened. 
The stock market's gains were tempered briefly by news that a postal worker in Washington, D.C., was diagnosed with anthrax contracted by inhalation. Additionally, two other postal workers in Washington have died and their deaths are being investigated to determine if they died of that same ailment. 
But stocks took the anthrax reports in stride, suggesting a new and surprising level of confidence among market participants, some analysts said Monday. "The market is really shrugging off this news," said Mark Donahoe, a managing director at U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. 
Upbeat earnings news from American Express, released Monday afternoon, seemed to give stocks an additional lift. 
Investors may be shifting their focus away from concerns about anthrax exposure and U.S. military maneuvers in Afghanistan to take a closer look at quarterly earnings results, said Steven Kroll Sr., managing director at Monness, Crepsi & Hardt. 
The uncertainty on the global front "looks like it is going to be a long, drawn-out affair," Mr. Kroll said. "I think stocks will revert back to being earnings-driven." 
Although dismal by ordinary standards, last week's flood of quarterly earnings reports got a reasonably upbeat reception from investors, who seem to have approached them with extremely low expectations. "The markets acted pretty well last week in light of some very ugly earnings," said Mr. Donahoe of U.S. Bancorp. That resilience might be giving hope to investors this week, he added. 
Still, investors will be carefully sifting through quarterly results in the coming week to get a fix on how the fourth quarter is shaping up, Mr. Kroll argued. 
Third-quarter earnings showed several pockets of strength on Monday, with big companies such as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing and U.S. Steel posting results that met or topped analysts' estimates. 
The Dow industrials got an additional boost shortly after 2 p.m. EDT when index component American Express reported earnings that, excluding certain items, beat Wall Street previously lowered estimates. 
The financial-services concern posted net income of $298 million, or 22 cents a share, down 60% from $737 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to a corporate restructuring and the September 11 attacks, American Express said it would have earned $595 million, or 45 cents a share, for the latest quarter. Analysts had been expecting earnings of 30 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Shares of American Express surged after the quarterly earnings release, closing up 3.4% at $30.32. 
Chip stocks helped lead the Nasdaq composite higher, with the Philadelphia semiconductor index gaining 5.4%. The rally seemed to be a continuation of Friday's gains in the sector, sparked by positive earnings news from KLA-Tencor. 
U.S. Steel, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, said it swung to a third-quarter loss from a profit a year earlier, hurt by oversupply and a weak economy. But excluding charges related to the closure of one mill and damage at another, U.S. Steel said its loss was much narrower than what was forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Shares of U.S. Steel rose 9.7% to $14.74. 
Investors also sent 3M shares nearly 5% higher after the maker of chemical and adhesive products squeaked by Wall Street estimates, despite a 21% decline in net income. And oil producers Conoco and USX-Marathon Group handily beat analysts' forecasts. 
But not all the earnings news was cheery. Local phone company SBC Communications recorded net income that was slightly below estimates. Shares of SBC, a component of the Dow industrials, fell 5.1% to $41.40. 
Meanwhile, the outlook for corporate profits in the fourth quarter seems discouraging, some analysts noted. On Monday, 3M guided Wall Stret's earnings expectations lower for the upcoming quarter, and a top executive at U.S. Steel told analysts that the company's fourth quarter would be "difficult." 
Companies "are meeting third quarter expectations, but they are talking down the fourth quarter," said Mr. Kroll of Monness Crespi & Hardt. He said that some of the rise in Monday's markets might be a carryover from Friday's buying activity related to the expiration of U.S. stock option and index option contracts, an event known as "double witching." 
One of the hardest-hit stocks on Monday was Enron, an energy concern that said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was seeking information about certain complex transactions it undertook with a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. Shares of Enron plunged 21% to $20.65. 
Overseas, stocks closed higher. London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained 1.1%, while Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index rose 2%. Earlier in the day, Japan's Nikkei 225 average closed with a gain of 0.3%, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended 0.3% lower. 
In economic news, the Conference Board reported that its index of leading indicators for the month fell 0.5% in September, matching the estimates of economists surveyed by Thomson Global Markets. The index -- a composite of measurements aimed at forecasting likely changes in the economy -- included some data gathered after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
The decline, which was the index's largest one-month drop since January 1996, confirmed that the widespread weakness in the U.S. economy is deepening, the Conference Board said. Falling stock prices and rising initial unemployment claims were two of the index components that contributed most negatively to the September reading. 
In August, the leading-indicators index slipped 0.1%, less than the previous estimate of a 0.3% decline. Even so, the back-to-back declines paint a bleak economic picture, said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. 
The two-month decline in the index suggests that the already-weak economy is likely to remain weak into next year, Mr. Goldstein said. The overall reading from these numbers indicates that manufacturing and services are experiencing a significant slowdown. 
In major U.S. market action: 
Stocks rose. On the Big Board, where 1.09 billion shares were traded, 1,813 stocks rose and 1,291 fell. On the Nasdaq, 1.49 billion shares changed hands. 
Bonds were mixed. The 10-year Treasury note rose less than 1/16 point Monday, or 62.5 cents for each $1,000 invested. The yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 4.618%. The 30-year bond fell 1/16 point to yield 5.364%. 
The dollar rose. The dollar bought 122.56 yen, compared with 121.20 yen late Friday. The euro traded at 89.18 U.S. cents, down from 89.84 cents late Friday.

Enron Faces Holder Suit From Fincl Chief Pacts

10/22/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- A shareholder of Enron Corp. (ENE) filed a derivative suit in Texas court alleging that Enron's board breached their fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
In a press release Monday, a law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest.
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars. 
On Oct. 16, Enron announced that it will take a $35 million charge relating to the limited partnerships and revealed that the company had to repurchase 55 million of its shares in order to unwind its involvement in the partnerships, thereby reducing the company's shareholder equity by $1.2 billion. 
On Monday, Enron said the Securities and Exchange Commission recently requested additional information regarding the limited partnerships. 
On Oct. 19, The Wall Street Journal reported that Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capital increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, which was set up in Dec. 1999 principally to do business with Enron. 
Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been with the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managing company investments. 
Enron's New York Stock Exchange listed shares fell to a 52-week low on Monday following news that the SEC requested additional information. 
A spokeswoman from Enron said the company has not seen the lawsuit and it does not comment on pending litigation.

Shapiro Haber & Urmy Files Class Action on Behalf of Purchasers of Enron Corporation Stock (NYSE: ENE) in The Period From July 13, 2001 Through October 16, 2001

10/22/2001

(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)
BOSTON, Oct. 22 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP has filed a class action suit alleging securities fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Division), 515 Rusk Ave., Houston, Texas 77002, against Enron Corporation ("Enron") (NYSE: ENE) and certain of its officers and directors. 
The case was filed on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period from July 13, 2001 through October 16, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").
The complaint alleges that the defendants violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Exchange Act"), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and that defendants' wrongful conduct artificially inflated the price of Enron common stock during the Class Period. The complaint charges that the defendants misrepresented and concealed material facts concerning the Company's financial transactions with two partnerships established by Enron's Chief Financial Officer, which resulted in substantial losses to Enron and a reduction in shareholders' equity of over $1 billion. The price of Enron's common stock plummeted over 20% in just three trading days following disclosure of the financial losses resulting from Enron's dealings with these partnerships. 
Plaintiff seeks to recover damages suffered by class members and is represented by the law firm of Shapiro Haber & Urmy LLP, which has successfully prosecuted numerous securities class actions on behalf of defrauded investors. More information about the firm and its qualifications is available on the firm's website at www.shulaw.com.

USA: UPDATE 3-SEC looks into Enron deals, stock slides 20 pct.
By David Howard Sinkman

10/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20 percent on Monday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. 
A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry.
Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. 
Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months at the helm. 
Enron shares declined $5.49, or 21 percent, to $20.56 in Monday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, shaving off almost $4.2 billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8 percent on Monday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. 
Shares declined 23 percent last week after the Journal ran its first story about the limited partnerships on Wednesday. 
Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related party transactions" involved the partnerships. 
"Related party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Fastow severed his ties to the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy-and communication-related investments. 
The Journal reported $35 million of its third-quarter loss of $638 million were connected with the limited partnerships 
Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. 
"Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. 
Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. 
"This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. 
"It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." 
Shares in the company are down 75 percent this year.

Enron shares plunge 20 percent after acknowledging SEC inquiry

10/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
HOUSTON (AP) - Shares of Enron Corp. plunged more than 20 percent Monday after the energy trading giant said the Securities and Exchange Commission had sought information company's transactions with limited partnerships, which were managed by an Enron senior officer. 
In a statement, Enron said it had provided the regulatory agency with information in response to an inquiry last week.
"We welcome this request," Enron chairman and chief executive officer Kenneth L. Lay said in a statement Monday. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." 
Investors were upset by the news, however, sending shares of Enron down dlrs 5.30 to dlrs 20.75 in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
The transactions took place in 1999 and 2000, according to Houston-based Enron's 2000 annual report. They resulted in a dlrs 16 million pre-tax gain to Enron in 1999 and a dlrs 36 million loss in 2000. 
Enron officials declined to provide details about the transactions or name the limited partnerships, instead referring questions to a section of the annual report on related party transactions. 
"Enron entered into transactions with (limited partnerships) to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets," according to the section in the annual report. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the SEC first contacted Enron last week and described the request is an "informal inquiry." 
"This is not an investigation," he said. "We see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us." 
SEC spokesman John Heine said he could not comment on the filings. "We can't confirm or deny that type of activity," Heine said. 
The electricity marketer and natural gas provider says both internal and external auditors and attorneys reviewed the related party arrangements, the company's board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, and they were disclosed in the company's SEC filings.

STOCKWATCH Enron lower after SEC questions transactions; AG Edwards downgrades

10/22/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down sharply in late morning trade, after the Securities and Exchange Commission requested the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions, prompting AG Edwards to downgrade the stock to 'hold' from 'buy', dealers said. 
At 11.10 am, Enron was down 4.29 usd, or 16.47 pct, at 21.76. The DJIA was up 57.57 points at 9,261.68, and the S&P 500 composite index was up 5.57 points at 1,079.05.
In a statement this morning, Enron confirmed that the SEC had requested documents, and said it would "cooperate fully" with the commission. 
However, the company did not give any details of the transactions concerned or of the reasons behind the SEC's request. 
According to AG Edwards analyst Mike Heim, Enron "significantly reduced" its equity to unroll a partnership arrangement with a partially-owned subsidiary formerly run by Enron's chief financial officer. 
"This arrangement, which was not discussed in past SEC filings, has led to a growing distrust of the company by the financial community. 
"In our opinion, the market is most likely overreacting to the news being disseminated over the last few days. 
"However, we can give no assurances that all the problems at Enron have been fully disclosed," Heim said. 
In its statement this morning, Enron said although its internal and external auditors and attorneys have reviewed the related-party arrangements, adding that the Board was "fully informed of and approved these arrangements", which were disclosed in the company's SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," said chief executive Kenneth Lay.

Enron Shares Slide as SEC Seeks Information on Deals With CFO's Partnership

10/22/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
HOUSTON -- Shares of Enron Corp. slumped Monday after the energy-trading concern said the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information about "certain related party transactions," including those between Enron and a limited partnership organized by its chief financial officer. 
Enron promised to cooperate fully with the SEC request and said in a prepared statement that it "welcomes" the request and looks forward to put "any concern about these transactions to rest."
In 4 p.m. EDT trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron (ENE) shares fell $5.40, or 21%, to $20.65. 
Last week The Wall Street Journal reported that a limited partnership organized by Andrew Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, made millions in profits in transactions with the firm. The story cited information reported in an internal partnership document. 
Enron also said last week it will repurchase up to 55 million shares that it had issued as part of transactions with LJM2 CO-Investment LP, the limited partnership created by Mr. Fastow. 
In addition, Enron took a $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter, mostly connected with write-downs of bad investments, producing a loss of $618 million, or 84 cents a share. Excluding charges, income was $393 million, or 43 cents a share, in the quarter. 
The charge covers a wide range of items including costs related to the limited partnerships that were, until recently, by Mr. Fastow. 
The company said the costs connected with the partnerships total $35 million and involve the early termination of "certain structured finance arrangements." 
The partnerships were set up two years ago, and while the company maintains that they are perfectly proper, some have suggested that it is a conflict of interest for Enron's chief financial officer to be involved in a partnership that was looking to purchase Enron assets, the Journal reported. 
The energy company said its auditors reviewed the arrangements and its board was fully informed and approved the deals, which were disclosed in SEC filings. 
"We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said on Monday. 
Separately, an Enron shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit in Texas court alleging Enron's board breached its fiduciary duties to the company by allowing Mr. Fastow to create and run certain limited partnerships. 
A law firm representing the unnamed shareholder said in a prepared statement that Enron's board lost over $35 million by allowing Mr. Fastow to run these partnerships, which engaged in transactions with Enron and presented a conflict of interest. 
The suit alleges that the limited partnerships bought Enron assets, permitting Mr. Fastow to use his inside knowledge of the company's financial condition to earn millions of dollars.

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)
2001-10-22 17:10 (New York)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update8)

     (Adds in sixth paragraph that analyst estimates dissolving
affiliated companies would cost $3 billion.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

      Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

                           Shares Plunge

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

      Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

      Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Rafael Rizo-Patron

Enron cuts shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd due to partnership deal

10/18/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
LONDON (AFX) - Enron Corp said it has reduced its shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd as the company decided to repurchase 55 mln of its shares that it had issued as part of a series of complex transactions with an investment vehicle connected to its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 
Enron did not disclose the big equity reduction in its earnings release issued on Tuesday, when the Houston-based energy giant announced a 1.01 bln usd charge to third-quarter earnings that produced a 618 mln usd loss.
However, the company briefly mentioned it in a subsequent call with security analysts and confirmed it in response to questions yesterday. As a result of the reduction, Enron's shareholder equity dropped to 9.5 bln usd, the company said. 
In an interview, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay said about 35 mln usd of the 1.01 bln usd charge to earnings was related to transactions with LJM2 Co-Investment LP, a limited partnership created and run by Fastow. 
In a conference call yesterday with investors, Lay said 55 mln shares had been repurchased by Enron, as the company "unwound" its participation in the transactions. In the third quarter, the company's average number of shares outstanding was 913 mln. 
According to Rick Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, these shares were contributed to a "structured finance vehicle" set up about two years ago in which Enron and LJM2 were the only investors. In exchange for the stock, the entity provided Enron with a note. 
The aim of the transaction was to provide hedges against fluctuating values in some of Enron's broadband telecommunications and other technology investments. Causey did not elaborate on what form those hedges took. 
Subsequently, both the value of Enron's stock and the value of the broadband investments hedged by the entity dropped sharply, the report said. As a result, Enron decided essentially to dissolve the financing vehicle and reacquire the shares. When Enron reacquired the shares, it also canceled the note it had received from the entity. 
Given all the complexities of the LJM-related financing vehicle and the questions it raised outside the company, "the confusion factor wasn't worth the trouble of trying to continue this," Causey said. 
Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, described the capital reduction "as just a balance-sheet issue" and therefore was not deemed "material" for disclosure purposes.

Calif Energy Panel OKs First Step For 1160MW In Projects

10/18/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Energy Commission has accepted as "data adequate" applications to build a 900-megawatt power plant and two peaker plants totaling 260 megawatts, a press release said. 
The data adequacy vote means an application has been accepted as having sufficient information to proceed with the commission's approval process.
Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Roseville Energy Facility LLC unit has proposed building a 900-MW natural gas-fired plant in Sacramento, Calif., to be online by the fourth quarter of 2004. The construction cost will be $350-$450 million for the combined-cycle project, which will undergo a 12-month review process by the commission. 
GWF Energy LLC has applied to build the 169-MW Tracy Peaker Project, a simple cycle plant in the San Joaquin Valley, Calif., that would be online by July 2002. Peaker plants operate during times of high electricity demand. 
The company also applied to build the 91-MW Henrietta Peaker Project, 20 miles south of Hanford, Calif., which would consist of two turbine generators and come on line by June 2002. 
Electricity generated from the two peaker projects will be sold to the state's Department of Water Resources under a 10-year contract.

USA: Enron's stock slides as equity reduction digested.

10/18/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock fell sharply on Thursday as investors digested news of a $1.2 billion reduction in the energy giant's shareholder equity that attracted little attention when it was first disclosed earlier this week. 
In afternoon trading Enron's stock was off $2.96 or, 9.2 percent at $29.24 per share.
Enron reported its first quarterly loss in over four years on Tuesday after taking charges of $1.01 billion against earnings to cover expenses and writedowns on investments that fall outside its core wholesale energy operations. 
The reduction in shareholder equity was not mentioned in the company's earnings statement but was discussed by Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay in an earnings conference call with analysts and investors on Tuesday. 
"Confidence has been shaken by the incremental disclosure. This is an extremely widely held stock and to assume that everybody listened to the conference call is probably asking too much," said one analyst who asked not to be identified. 
The reduction in equity was prominently reported in the Wall Street journal on Thursday, bringing it to the attention of a wider audience, analysts said. 
Lay said the equity writedown and a corresponding reduction in the number of Enron shares outstanding were related to the early termination of structured finance arrangements which had drawn criticism from some Wall Street analysts. 
As a result of the operation, Enron's debt to total capitalization ratio will rise to about 50 percent, but the company expects the proceeds of asset sales to reduce the ratio to around 40 percent by the end of next year, Lay said. 
Moody's Investor Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade because writedowns and charges had substantially reduced valuations for several Enron businesses. 
Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings.

Brazil's Copene, Elektro Plan to Sell 820 Mln Reais of Bonds
2001-10-18 13:53 (New York)


     Rio de Janeiro, Oct. 18 (Bloomberg) -- Two Brazilian
companies have asked securities regulators for permission to sell
820 million reais ($279 million) of bonds, raising the amount of
pending local market bond sales to 7.5 billion reais.

     Brazil's Copene-Petroquemica do Nordeste SA, a Petrochemical
company, has asked Brazil's government for permission to sell 625
million reais of bonds according to the country's security and
exchange regulator, the CVM. Banco Citibank SA, the Brazilian unit
of Citigroup Inc., will manage the sale.

     Elektro Eletricidade e Servicos SA, an electricity utility
controlled by U.S.-based Enron Corp. that distributes electricity
in Sao Paulo state, has asked for permission to sell 195 million
reais of bonds, according to a CVM filing.

     No further details about the sales was immediately available.
     Brazilian companies have scrambled to sell debt at home as
the local currency, the real, plunges against the dollar, making
dollar-denominated debt expensive and causing losses to mount as
the local currency value of dollar debts soars.

     So far this year, about 9.1 billion reais of local market
debt has been sold. Meanwhile corporate bond sales in euros or
dollars has slipped by almost two thirds to $1.7 billion in the
third quarter from $4.5 billion in the second, not including sales
through offshore subsidiaries, according to Bloomberg data.

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

Hello Drew,

It was great to speak briefly with you today!

The reason for my call is that I am doing research for a conference 
on Mexico and Latin American Gas. I was interested in speaking 
with you about what you think people need to know about what is 
going on those areas. (ie) Who are the major players, what are the 
major political and regulatory issues, what are some of the barriers 
to doing business?? I am also interested in having a speaker from 
Enron, and I was wondering if you might be able to give a few 
suggestions. I am thinking of holding the conference in early May, 
in Houston. Is that a good time?

I look forward to your response.
Thank you.
Laura Watton

Subject: Producer meeting


The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a "wet" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and "unwaive" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?

Dear Dan,

Given the current state of affairs here in the D.C. office, I am forwarding my resume for your review.  As you know, the lion's share of my experience has been with Enron's regulated pipelines, both domestic and overseas.  I appreciate your keeping me in mind should needs or opportunities arise in the pipeline group, whether these be as an employee or on a contract basis.

Thanks for your consideration!  

Kindest regards,  Ray

I would like to recommend a Personal Achievement Award for Audrey Robertson in the amount of $1000. Audrey has done a tremendous job the last several months in helping support several other groups in addition to her normal job duties. She has put forth a significant effort in performing administrative duties for the ETS Business Development and Facility Planning departments. Audrey has gone out of her way to provide daily assistance to these groups and I have received several notes indicating her exemplary performance. In addition, she helped coordinate the move for several groups to our new floors as well as plan a major customer meeting which had to be cancelled but was done in a manner resulting in no financial cost to Transwestern (saving us thousands of dollars).   

If you are in agreement with this recommendation please forward this note to Brian Schaffer in HR with your approval. Thanks.

	Steve

Rod, 
    What is going on?  Every day there is something new, different, and bad about us. Now, the rumor in Houston is that we are filing Ch. 11 on Monday. Is everything out, or is there more to come (Kilmer is about ready to blow an artery)?  Still views that Mark is out, Greg is temporary, and Stan is here for the Company for better or worse. What do you hear?

Enron Troubles Only the Tip of the Iceberg?
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>
Senior Columnist

Dealings with a related party have tarnished Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) reputation and crushed its stock, but it looks like that case is far from unique. 
The battered energy trader has done business with at least 15 other related entities, according to documents supplied by lawyers for people suing Enron. Moreover, Enron's new CFO, who has been portrayed by bulls as opposing the related-party dealings of his predecessor, serves on 12 of these entities. And Enron board members are listed as having directorships and other roles at a Houston-based related entity called ES Power 3. 
The extent of Enron's dealings with these companies, or the value of its holdings in them, couldn't be immediately determined. But the existence of these partnerships could feed investors' fears that Enron has billions of dollars of liabilities that don't show up on its balance sheet. If that's so, the company's financial strength and growth prospects could be much less than has generally been assumed on Wall Street, where the company was long treated with kid gloves. 
Enron didn't immediately respond to questions seeking details about ES Power or about the role of the chief financial officer, Jeff McMahon, in the various entities. Enron's board members couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 
Ten Long Days
Enron's previous CFO, Andrew Fastow, was replaced by McMahon Wednesday after investors criticized Fastow's role in a partnership called LJM, which had done complex hedging transactions with Enron. As details of this deal and two others emerged, Enron stock cratered. 
The turmoil that resulted in Fastow's departure began two weeks ago, when Enron reported third-quarter earnings that met estimates. However, the company failed to disclose in its earnings press release a $1.2 billion charge to equity related to unwinding the LJM transactions. Since then, investors and analysts have been calling with increasing vehemence for the company to divulge full details of its business dealings with other related entities. Enron stock sank 6% Friday, meaning it has lost 56% of its value in just two weeks.

However, Enron has yet to break out a full list of related entities. The company has said nothing publicly about McMahon's participation in related entities, nor has it mentioned that its board members were directors or senior officers in ES Power 3. (Nor has it explained the extensive use of Star Wars-related names by the related-party companies.) It's not immediately clear what ES Power 3 is or does. So far, subpoenas issued by lawyers suing Enron have determined the names of senior officers of ES Power 3 and its formation date, January 1999. 
Among ES Power 3's senior executives are Enron CEO Ken Lay, listed as a director, and McMahon and Fastow, listed as executive vice presidents. A raft of external directors are named as ES Power 3 directors, including Comdisco CEO Norman Blake and Ronnie Chan, chairman of the Hong Kong-based Hang Lung Group. A Comdisco spokeswoman says Blake isn't commenting on matters concerning Enron and a call to the Hang Lung group wasn't immediately returned. 
Demands, Demands
Rating agencies Moody's, Fitch and S&P recently put Enron's credit rating on review for a possible downgrade after an LJM deal that led to the $1.2 billion hit to equity. Enron still has a rating three notches above investment grade. But its bonds trade with a yield generally seen on subinvestment grade, or junk, bonds, suggesting the market believes downgrades are likely. 
If Enron's rating drops below investment grade, it must find cash or issue stock to pay off at least $3.4 billion in off-balance sheet obligations. In addition, many of its swap agreements contain provisions that demand immediate cash settlement if its rating goes below investment grade. 
Friday, the company drew down $3 billion from credit lines to pay off commercial paper obligations. Raising cash in the CP market could be tough when investors are jittery about Enron's condition. 
This week, a number of energy market players reduced exposure to Enron. However, in a Friday press release, CEO Lay said that Enron was the "market-maker of choice in wholesale gas and power markets." He added: "It is evident that our customers view Enron as the major liquidity source of the global energy markets." 
McMahon reportedly objected to Fastow's role in LJM, allegedly believing it posed Fastow with a conflict of interests. But he will need to convince investors that the 12 entities he's connected to don't do the same. Enron has said that its board fully approved of the LJM deals that Fastow was involved in. Now, board members will have to comment on their own roles in a related entity. 

Under The Radar: Enron's Flickering Bulb

While the bulb at Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) may not have burnt out, it's clearly flickering. To date, investors aren't sure whether Chairman and CEO Ken Lay is up to the task of re-energizing the company he once built to greatness. 
What's happened at the Houston energy giant-turned-dwarf could've been imagined with any number of ne'er-do-well companies during the well-chronicled bubble. But this is Enron. As one longtime Enron bull and shareholder said, "I never had to worry about Enron's ability to survive until this week. I still find it hard to believe." 
Peter Eavis has done an exceptional job of chronicling Enron's adventures for some time. If you'd listened to him earlier this year, you'd have profited from his knowledge. His reporting on Enron's partnership shenanigans to the departure of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow has been outstanding. 
The rumors -- from a pending bankruptcy to a Justice Department investigation -- are, for now, just that. And, Enron did not single-handedly cause the California power crisis, nor is Royal Dutch/Shell (RD:NYSE - news - commentary) about to make a bid to buy the company. Sources do tell me that head-count reductions are likely through employee buyout offers and the company is set to refocus on its core energy business. And, while former CEO Jeff Skilling shares culpability for the current mess, his departure appears only indirectly related to Enron's current woes. 
Now, Enron faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding both its business and, more importantly, its reputation. 
The Company's Challenge
But what does Enron do now? It's very simple. Come clean, clean up the mess and refocus on its core business: wholesale energy markets, risk management and retail energy services. They support each other and create a platform that can be plenty profitable without a lot of gimmicks. 
"Our gut feel is that Enron can pull it off, and long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually the stock gets valued on earnings, with upside potential to $25 per share over the next 12-18 months," says Jeff Dietert, power analyst at Simmons & Co. and a member of the TSC Energy Roundtable. "We believe new money with high risk tolerance should wait until Enron announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery." 
Dietert outlines four challenges for Enron. One, management must regain the Street's confidence and persuade investors that it can resolve balance-sheet strength and generate the expected earnings and cash flow. Two, Enron must maintain its investment-grade credit rating. Three, Enron must successfully execute its divestiture plans. Four, Enron must control the timing of the recognition of the write-down in the value of any assets where market value is less than book. 
Straightforward? Yes. Easy to accomplish? No. 
Although Enron says additional write-downs are unlikely -- except a $200 million charge early next year as the result of an accounting change -- analysts aren't so sure. They're focused on the company's Global Assets portfolio, sporting $6 billion in book value but generating an EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) loss of $18 million over the past 12 months. 
The divestitures include $390 million in exploration and production assets in India, $250 million in a Puerto Rico power plant and $250 million in a Brazilian power plant in the fourth quarter as well as the pending sale of Portland General, which is set to close in 2002. There will likely be others. However, Enron has to execute here, and given the current state of its affairs, the seller will feel the pressure. 
The credit-rating issue is a fine line. The current ratings, BBB+ from Standard & Poor's and Baa1 from Moody's, are three levels above non-investment grade. However, both rating agencies now have Enron on their radar screens for possible downgrades. Dietert estimates that Enron's debt-to-market cap will be about 48% by year-end, and the company has interest coverage (EBITDA/ interest expense) of about 3.5 times. By comparison, the average S&P BBB-rated company has a debt-to-cap of 47.4% and interest coverage of about 6.1 times. The average BB company has debt-to-cap of 61.3% and interest expense of 3.8 times. 
Frankly, everything falls on Enron's management team and its ability to reassure investors. "If Enron's management does not step up to calm investor fears, these fears could become a self-fulfilling prophecy," Dietert says. "In the potentially vicious cycle, investor fears could drive stocks down; the lower stock prices force the rating agencies to consider downgrades; potentially lower credit ratings force counter-parties to reduce exposure to Enron, limiting Enron's ability to generate earnings and cash flow." 
It's time for Enron to grow up. Despite a lot of uncertainties and risk, I think it will. Investors with risk capital should do their homework on the stock and think about strategy. It's a tough call that requires strict, individual discipline. 
There's an irony to this whole story, especially in Enron's lack of candor in reporting its financial results. In a much-lauded advertising campaign, Enron, looking to challenge conventional wisdom, asks the simple question, "Why? Ask why." 
Investors are now asking. It's time for Ken Lay to answer.

DJ Enron Unit,New England Market Downplay Report Of Default
2001-10-26 17:14 (New York)

   By Kristen McNamara 
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
 
  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) retail sales unit defaulted on its
credit requirement in New England's wholesale power market this month, but the
event was neither unique nor newsworthy, the energy company and the
organization that developed the market's rules said Friday. 

  The operator of the region's wholesale power market informed Enron Energy
Services last week that, for the third time in 12 months, it had traded a
greater volume of electricity than allowed by the bond it had posted and was at
risk for expulsion from New England's market. 

  But it was administrative mixups, rather than financial problems, that
triggered the warning, which a few other companies have also received in the
past, the market's rulemaker said. 

  "I can state with considerable confidence that there have been other
participants" that have defaulted on their credit agreements, "and it's never
been in the news," said David Doot, secretary and general counsel for the New
England Power Pool, which developed the policies governing the region's
electricity market. "My instinct is that this is blown way the hell out of
proportion." 

  News of the Enron unit's default appeared in a trade publication and a major
metropolitan newspaper this week, as Enron's dealings with partnerships headed
by its former chief financial officer contributed to a plunge in the company's
stock and bond prices. 

  Enron Energy Services never received word that it had defaulted on its
bonding requirement twice before, because both times it corrected the problem
within a day, spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney said. 

  The letter sent by ISO New England, which operates the region's power market,
to notify the Enron unit of its third violation was addressed to the wrong
person, delaying the company's response, Mahoney said. 

  "Clearly, it was an administrative error that we immediately took care of to
ensure that we would never exceed the volume limit," Mahoney said. 

  The company resolved the problem by Oct. 19, Mahoney said. ISO New England
spokeswoman Ellen Foley confirmed Friday that the company had cured its
default. 

  It's rare for a company to default three times, but it has happened on
occasion, Foley and Doot said. 

  "I won't say it's commonplace, but I won't say it's unusual for a participant
to find itself out of compliance," Doot said. "Those things have in fact
happened from time to time."

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN
2001-10-26 16:47 (New York)

Enron Lawsuit Over Microsoft Broadband Agreement May Block MSN

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s lawsuit
alleging Microsoft breached a contract for broadband services
could temporarily block the largest software company's high-speed
Internet service in some U.S. regions.

     Microsoft said the dispute temporarily blocks the company
from providing the high-speed service in areas where Enron
provides broadband access, leaving MSN fully operational only in
the 14 states where Qwest Communications International Inc.
operates, said Bob Visse, director of marketing for MSN.

     Enron's lawsuit was filed yesterday. Microsoft had planned to
offer fast Internet access in 45 cities beginning yesterday to
give the largest software company access to potential customers in
29 million homes. Microsoft, the No. 2 U.S. Internet provider, is
making a push to win customers from AOL Time Warner Inc.

     ``We are trying to resolve the issues with Enron as quickly
as possible and at the same time we are evaluating other
providers,'' Visse said.

     Officials at Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader,
did not immediately return calls for comment.

                         The Agreement

     Enron in June signed an agreement with Microsoft to provide
bandwidth for MSN Internet service. Under the agreement, Enron
isn't required to deliver operational broadband services if
Microsoft hasn't first provided a billing and ordering system, Dow
Jones newswire reported.

     Enron claims in its lawsuit that Microsoft failed to deliver
the ordering and billing system required in the initial phase of
the deal, Dow reported.

     Enron's lawsuit comes after Microsoft said in an Oct. 23
letter that Enron will have breached the contract if it hasn't
provided an operational bandwidth system by Oct. 25, allowing
Microsoft to recover damages.

     Shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft fell 36 cents
to $62.20, while Enron shares fell 95 cents to $15.40.

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

Enron Executives Sent Requests for Details of Affiliate Profits

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Lawyers for a shareholder
suing Enron Corp. are asking executives of the largest energy
trader to disclose any income they made from their involvement
with affiliated companies that bought and sold Enron assets.

     Lawyers have made the requests to President Greg Whalley,
Vice Chairman Mark Frevert and Chief Financial Officer Jeff
McMahon and 83 other employees arrived at Enron's Houston offices
this week, said Paul Paradis, a partner in the New York law firm
Abbey Gardy. Requests also were sent to 17 Enron partnerships such
as Whitewing Management and Marlin Water.

     Paradis represents Fred Greenberg, an Enron shareholder who
is suing the company's board for allowing former Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow to run partnerships that cost the company at
least $35 million in cash and $1.2 billion in lost shareholder
equity.

     The requests are aimed at determining if Enron executives
benefited financially from roles as officers and directors of
partnerships that bought and sold company assets. Enron formed at
least 18 such affiliated companies, listing executives and
employees as officers and directors of the partnerships, according
to Texas secretary of state records.

     Under Texas law, failure to respond to the document requests
will result in subpoenas being issued. Subpoenas could go out next
week if responses don't arrive by then, Paradis said. Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to requests for comment
about the document requests.

     The executives earned no income from the partnerships, Enron
spokesman Mark Palmer has said. ``There are no financial interests
in the structures themselves for any Enron employee,'' Palmer
said. He said it's common for a company to name its executives to
the boards of affiliates.

                       Affiliates Have Debts

     Texas records show Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay,
Frevert, Whalley, McMahon and dozens of other people who list
their address as Enron's corporate headquarters serving as
officers and directors of limited liability companies and foreign
business corporations.

     The document requests ask Enron executives for information on
any form of compensation or benefit received from any of the
affiliates, including stock grants and options. They also ask the
executives to disclose any equity or partnership interests in the
affiliates.

     Enron formed many of the affiliates to buy company assets
such as power plants and natural-gas pipelines. That allowed Enron
to move debt associated with those projects off its books.

     The affiliates bought the assets with borrowed money. They
plan to repay the debt by eventually selling the assets. Enron
might be liable for any shortfall between the sales proceeds and
the debt. That could amount to at least $3.3 billion if the assets
don't generate any money, a remote possibility, the company has
said.

                            Few Answers

     Investors and analysts pressed Enron Chief Executive Officer
Kenneth Lay for details on the finances of the partnerships in a
conference call Tuesday.

     Today, Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't respond to
questions about one of them, ES Power 3 LLC.

     Texas records list 78 Enron executives and employees as
officers, directors and managers of ES Power 3 LLC. The entire
Enron board is also listed.

     Shares of Enron $1.15 to $15.20 in late trading.

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)
2001-10-26 16:15 (New York)

Enron Still Target in California Amid Other Problems (Update1)

     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)

     Sacramento, California, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.,
facing an inquiry by federal securities regulators into
partnerships run by the former chief financial officer, remains a
target of investigations and lawsuits in California.

     California lawmakers and regulators have accused power
providers of manipulating the state's energy market to raise
prices. Enron, the biggest energy trader, and other power sellers
have denied the charges repeatedly.

     Next month, a California Senate committee investigating the
power market plans to hold a hearing to determine if Enron and
other generators are complying with subpoenas for trading
documents. Enron has been filing documents in Sacramento,
California.

     ``They are still putting documents in their depository, and I
don't think they've completed that process,'' said Alexandra
Montgomery, a consultant to the committee. It ``remains to be
seen'' whether Enron is complying with its subpoena, she said.

     The suits and inquiries came after wholesale power prices in
California soared, leaving the state's two largest utilities
insolvent. Under California's plan to open its electricity market
to competition, the utilities of PG&E Corp. and Edison
International weren't allowed to pass rising costs to customers.

     ``I know that we're doing our best to comply with what the
committee is asking for,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer. ``We are
putting documents in the depository, and we're looking forward to
a speedy resolution.''

     Shares of Houston-based Enron have fallen by more than half
since Oct. 16. The company ousted Andrew Fastow as the chief
financial officer Wednesday amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into a partnership he ran that cost Enron $35
million.

                            Grand Jury

     Enron also is one of the companies being investigated for
civil and criminal violations by California Attorney General Bill
Lockyer, who convened a grand jury in June.

     Lockyer has been criticized by Enron officials for telling
the Wall Street Journal in May that he would like to put Enron
Chairman Kenneth Lay in ``an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with
a tattooed dude who says `Hi my name is Spike, honey.' '' Lockyer
later apologized for the remark.

     The attorney general's investigation is proceeding, Lockyer
spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. Michioku said she didn't know
when civil or criminal charges against Enron or other power
providers might be filed.

     ``Our investigation is still being pursued,'' she said. ``We
had to go to court to get Enron to turn over documents, so that
slowed things down a bit.''

     Enron's Palmer said he didn't know the status of the attorney
general's investigation.

     ``I think the attorney general demonstrated his willingness
to take a fair and impartial look a long time ago when he made his
vulgar and unfounded remarks about our chairman,'' Palmer said.

                           More Lawsuits

     Enron, along with other major power providers such as Duke
Energy Corp. and Dynegy Inc., face at least five lawsuits alleging
they manipulated California energy prices in violation of
antitrust laws.

     The cases, which include separate complaints filed by the
City of San Francisco, California Lieutenant Governor Cruz
Bustamante and various consumers, currently are in state courts
awaiting a coordination proceeding, said Michael Aguirre, a lawyer
representing Bustamante. The lawsuits should be assigned to a
judge by the end of next month, he said.

     If the complaints succeed, the companies might be ordered to
repay profits from any illegal activities and pay fines, including
triple damages.

     Enron's stock fell 95 cents, or 5.8 percent, to $15.40,
declining for the eighth day in a row. The shares have fallen 80
percent in the past 12 months.

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)
2001-10-26 16:18 (New York)

Enron Bonds Fall as Company Taps $3 Bln Credit Line (Update5)

     (Adds investor comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and shares
fell after the largest energy trader tapped a $3 billion credit
line because it has been shut out of the leading market for low-
interest, short-term loans.

     The company's stock has fallen 54 percent in the past 14 days
after investors questioned its transactions with affiliates run by
Enron's former chief financial officer. The shares fell 95 cents,
or 5.8 percent, to $15.40 today.

     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay has failed to reassure
investors that the company's credit rating won't be cut, investors
said. Enron can no longer borrow in commercial paper markets,
where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer.

     ``Do they have the financial flexibility they once had? No,''
said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion in bonds at Fifth
Third Bancorp. ``People are questioning the credibility of
management.''

      The company will use its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion
in commercial paper it has outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer said.

                            Bonds Drop

     Enron's 6 3/4 percent bonds, which mature in 2009, declined 1
1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and an offer of 86
cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a rating of ``BBB+,''
yield 9.53 percent.

     Investors have grown concerned that the company's credit
rating will be cut after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses
from failed investments. Enron needs good credit to raise cash
daily to keep trading partners from demanding collateral and to
settle transactions.

     Enron's decision to tap its credit line was ``a smart
financial move,'' said Stephen Moore, a vice president at Moody's
Investors Service who follows the company. ``It took away the
hassle and time-consuming nature of rolling commercial paper and
insured access to capital.''

     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, their
yield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bonds
that carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companies
with ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow for
seven years.

     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy back
holdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the value
of Enron investors' stock.

     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enron
assets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets to
the partnerships to keep related debt off its books. The
partnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling the
assets.

                         Other Liabilities

     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed money
comes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to find
the best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron would
have to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sell
for and the amount of the debt.

     One way would be issuing common shares to exchange for Enron
preferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That would
thin out the holdings of every other investor.

     Of the two main bond-rating companies, Moody's and Fitch have
Enron on watch for possible downgrade, and Standard & Poor's
lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook to negative. Egan-Jones
Rating Co. today lowered its rating on Enron's debt to ``BB+,''
one notch below investment grade, from ``BBB-.''

     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amount
to at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.

     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on
Wednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into a
partnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in direct
losses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from the
partnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

     ``It looks like the guy who was supposed to do everything for
the benefit of shareholders was running partnerships for the
benefit of himself,'' Fifth Third's Cassady said.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Lay said in a
statement.

Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Investigates Potential Claims on Behalf of Enron Corp. -- ENE -- Employees and Former Employees

10/26/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 2001--Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. is currently investigating potential ERISA claims on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of Enron's retirement and 401(k) plans. 
The investigation period covers January 2000 through October 2001. The investigation focuses on concerns that, under the law interpreting ERISA, Enron and its plan administrators may have breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and prudence by failing to disclose and inform the Plan participants and beneficiaries with respect to the use of employer stock as a Plan investment. Rather than providing complete and accurate information to the Plans' participants, it may be alleged that Enron and the plan administrators may have withheld and concealed material information, thereby encouraging participants and beneficiaries to continue to make and to maintain substantial investments in company stock and the Plans. This investigation is being conducted in light of recent events.
On Oct. 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the Company was taking "non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share," in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships, controlled by Enron's CFO, and that the Company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding of the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. In addition, several recently filed securities suits allege that Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. Enron retirees have lost a substantial portion of their retirement earnings due to the drop in value of their retirement assets. 
If you are a member of an Enron retirement plan, wish to discuss this announcement, or have information relevant to the investigation, you may contact paralegal Liza Catabay, or any member of our team (Britt Tinglum, Liza Catabay, or Lynn Sarko) toll free at 800/776-6044, or via e-mail at investor@kellerrohrback.com. 
Seattle's Keller Rohrback L.L.P. has successfully represented shareholders and consumers in class action cases for over a decade. Its trial lawyers have obtained judgments and settlements on behalf of clients in excess of seven billion dollars.

SEC Seeks Information on Enron Dealings With Partnerships Recently Run by F=
astow
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/23/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A3
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. said it has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commi=
ssion seeking information on the energy giant's controversial dealings with=
 partnerships that were set up and run until recently by its chief financia=
l officer, Andrew S. Fastow.=20
Following Enron's announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry, the co=
mpany's stock took another big slide, falling more than 20% in New York Sto=
ck Exchange trading. As of 4 p.m., Enron shares were trading at $20.65, off=
 $5.40, knocking about $4 billion off Enron's market capitalization. Volume=
 topped the Big Board's most-active list at about 36 million shares. A week=
 ago, Enron stock was trading at about $33 a share. Subsequently, the compa=
ny announced a $1.01 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 m=
illion loss.
Analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurki=
ng amid Enron's vast and extremely complex operations. The company has deal=
ings with a number of related entities. Under certain circumstances, if Enr=
on's credit rating and stock price fall far enough, the company would be ob=
ligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities, d=
iluting the holdings of current shareholders.=20
Enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is s=
trong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults.=20
In a statement, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the com=
pany "will cooperate fully" with the SEC inquiry and "look(s) forward to th=
e opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." Enron h=
as consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastow-related =
partnerships were proper and properly disclosed. The company has said it pu=
t billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership-related transact=
ions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions.=20
The SEC inquiry came from the agency's Fort Worth, Texas, regional office. =
According to a person familiar with the matter, this would indicate that th=
e inquiry comes from the SEC's enforcement arm, as opposed to its corporate=
-finance section. The participation of the enforcement branch would indicat=
e that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of=
 securities law. However, enforcement-branch inquiries often don't produce =
any allegations of wrongdoing. It also appears that the SEC hasn't yet take=
n the step of launching a formal investigation, which would be a sign that =
the agency believes securities laws might have been violated. The SEC decli=
ned to comment.=20
Certainly, there have been questions and concerns about those partnership t=
ransactions, which contributed to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder e=
quity last week as part of Enron's efforts to unwind the deals. Mr. Fastow,=
 who has declined repeated interview requests, resigned from the partnershi=
ps, known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, in late July in the f=
ace of rising conflict-of-interest concerns by Wall Street analysts and maj=
or company investors.=20
Since then, internal partnership documents have shown that Mr. Fastow and p=
erhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in =
fees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM2, the larger of th=
e two partnerships.=20
Mr. Fastow's partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron, =
according to people familiar with the matter. For instance, these people sa=
y, sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999, Enron Treasurer=
 Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained =
about potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr. Fastow's activities. Mr.=
 Skilling didn't share Mr. McMahon's concern, these people say, and Mr. McM=
ahon requested and received reassignment to another post.=20
Mr. Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in mid-August,=
 citing personal reasons and the fall in Enron's stock price, which peaked =
at about $90 a share last year. Mr. McMahon and Mr. Skilling haven't respon=
ded to repeated interview requests.=20
Investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enron's de=
alings with other related entities. In some cases, Enron could be required =
to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if c=
ertain so-called double trigger provisions occur.=20
For example, last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II, which=
 sold $915 million in notes that are due July 15, 2003. However, Enron can =
be considered in default, in advance of that date, if its stock price falls=
 below $34.13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to b=
elow investment grade by either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poo=
r's.=20
Currently, Enron debt is still investment-grade at both ratings agencies an=
d would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment =
grade category. Last week, Moody's put Enron on review for a possible downg=
rade. However, observers believe that even if Moody's lowers Enron's rating=
, the company will still be investment-grade.

Where Did the Value Go at Enron?
By FLOYD NORRIS
New York Times
What really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders e=
ver seen?
Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/=
marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=3Dhttp://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/=
html-companyprofile.asp&symb=3DENE>) released its quarterly earnings a week=
 ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company=
 said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the tran=
sactions.
The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been =
raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured =
in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a pr=
eliminary inquiry.
Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the =
slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confron=
t a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet valu=
e to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as=
 investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they =
have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.
The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a n=
ews release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was bri=
efly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listener=
s seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's c=
hairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that w=
as disclosed in the earnings release.
When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less=
 than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity =
was related to the termination of "structured finance vehicles" involving p=
artnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial offic=
er.
"Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how=
 the company goes about its business," said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit anal=
yst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's "c=
redibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its o=
wn."
Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its=
 financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another confe=
rence call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today.=20
The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many a=
nalysts. They referred to such things as "share settled costless collar arr=
angements" and "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent natu=
re of existing restricted forward contracts." The disclosures said the comp=
any entered into the transactions "to hedge certain merchant investments an=
d other assets."
It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the=
 underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall St=
reet Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investo=
rs, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distri=
butions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to =
discuss the arrangements in any detail.
One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the terminati=
on of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, =
or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earni=
ngs. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.
Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot p=
roduce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company th=
at sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will=
 report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders e=
quity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, "is the result of Enron=
's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver En=
ron shares in future periods."
Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron'=
s debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the deta=
ils were not clear, "Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount=
 of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and the=
y were not" worth that much.
Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expense=
s, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed on=
ly in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in sh=
areholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, =
which has yet to be released.
Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted =
strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to p=
rovide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the que=
stioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling late=
r resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman=
 and former chief executive, took back the latter title.
While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were=
 generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the domi=
nant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phe=
nomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important ro=
le in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was o=
nly enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.
But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into proble=
ms, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the compan=
y's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was be=
cause of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wond=
ered if there might have been similar deals with others.
Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to unde=
rstand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for do=
ing just that.
In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s=
 request for information. "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look=
 forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to =
rest," he said.

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION: SEC probes Enron over financial dealings=20
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By JULIE EARLE, JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTY

Enron, the US energy giant, disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exc=
hange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start=
 of an informal inquiry.=20
The announcement follows a rapid sell-off in the stock in reaction to Enron=
's surprise revelation last week of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eli=
minate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing v=
ehicles.=20
In revealing the SEC call for more detailed information "regarding certain =
related party transactions", Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that =
it should be more transparent. "We welcome this request," said Kenneth Lay,=
 Enron chairman and chief executive officer. "We will co-operate fully with=
 the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these=
 transactions to rest."=20
The SEC probe into Enron's financial dealings is an informal one at this st=
age, according to the company, and the request for documents is voluntary. =
However, SEC probes often begin lightly as investigators gather information=
 on an issue.=20
Such a probe could turn into a formal investigation at any time. In that ca=
se, regulators would be armed with subpoena powers and could demand certain=
 documents be handed over. The SEC would not confirm or deny the existence =
of the Enron probe.=20
Mr Lay did not say which transactions the SEC was reviewing, although analy=
sts believe they relate to Andrew Fastow, Enron chief financial officer, wh=
o has been reported to have run a limited partnership that bought assets va=
lued at hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron.=20
Analysts say the transactions, while controversial because of Mr Fastow's l=
inks to the company, have been disclosed. What concerns them, however, is h=
ow Enron valued the assets involved. www.ft.com/energy=20

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Group full of surprises after failing to =
open up=20
Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001
By SHEILA MCNULTY

Ronald Barone joked he would have to get plenty of rest ahead of Enron's re=
sults last week, noting the US energy company's reputation for producing wh=
at some analysts say is the most complicated of earnings reports.=20
The UBS Warburg analyst was, nevertheless, as ill-prepared as his peers for=
 the announcement of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eliminate the dilu=
tive effects of closing one of its controversial financing vehicles.=20
The news overshadowed Enron's on-target 26 per cent increase in third-quart=
er earnings per share, sending the stock plunging.=20
The Securities and Exchange Commission's subsequent request for more inform=
ation about Enron's financial activities has reinforced analyst perceptions=
 that the company should have been more transparent in its reporting.=20
Curt Launer, of Credit Suisse First Boston, says expectations for more disc=
losure had built up over the past two months. Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman, =
had promised to be more forthcoming when he resumed the duties of chief exe=
cutive following the resignation of Jeff Skilling in August.=20
While Mr Lay did improve Enron's disclosure by creating headings for new bu=
siness segments and providing more detail within each of them, the Dollars =
1.2bn charge still caught the market off guard.=20
"It came as a surprise to us," said Stephen Moore, of Moody's Investors Ser=
vice. "We should have been informed that it was there."=20
Mr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in "a fleetin=
g comment" during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it =
in its nine-page news release.=20
"Despite progress in other areas, there appears to be much more work ahead =
before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the=
 past are fully resolved," he said.=20
Enron contends that "we did disclose it in the conference call, and it was =
one of the first points raised in the Q and A session (on the conference ca=
ll)".=20
Mr Lay has pledged to co-operate with the SEC's request, which appears to b=
e part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation. In the=
 meantime, he adds, Enron will focus on its core businesses.=20
That is something analysts say Enron has strayed too far away from. Ray Nil=
es of Salomon Smith Barney says the company's core franchise - its wholesal=
e business - is doing well. Most of Enron's problems have arisen from stepp=
ing out of this area.=20
"They need to come clean on the financial effects of all of their off-balan=
ce sheet financing," Mr Niles says. "Investors want to see clear, easy-to-u=
nderstand financial information." Moody's has placed Enron's Dollars 13bn i=

Enron Discloses SEC Inquiry=20
Information Request Involves Ties to Money-Losing Partnerships=20
Washington Post
By Peter Behr
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, October 23, 2001; Page E03=20
Enron Corp. shares sank more than 20 percent yesterday after the Houston en=
ergy company disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission request for inf=
ormation about Enron's ties to outside investment partnerships set up by th=
e company's chief financial officer.
The SEC would not comment on its action, which Enron spokesman Mark Palmer =
called an "informal inquiry," not an investigation. "We welcome this reques=
t," said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of the Houston-based =
company.
But the announcement jarred investors' confidence in the giant energy-tradi=
ng company, already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive J=
effrey K. Skilling in August, and heavy losses from investments in broadban=
d Internet and other technology ventures.
"A lot of people threw in the towel today," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst =
with J.P. Morgan in New York.
The SEC request was made privately last Wednesday, the day after Enron repo=
rted a $1 billion write-off of investment losses and restructuring charges =
from unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations. The write-offs =
left Enron with a $618 million loss in the third quarter (84 cents a share)=
.
The Wall Street Journal reported last week that $35 million of the write-of=
f was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enron's chief f=
inancial officer, Andrew Fastow, and run by him until July.
Enron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased 55 million=
 shares of its stock held by the partnerships that Fastow had directed, red=
ucing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.
According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow set up several investment part=
nerships with the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships engaged in bi=
llions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and mad=
e major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron.
An Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enro=
n's board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financia=
l officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned milli=
ons of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships.=
 What Enron received from the relationships is not clear.
Feygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partne=
rships, which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncert=
ain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financ=
ial statements.=20
"In hindsight, that was an error in judgment. I don't think it was an error=
 in principle," the analyst said.
Enron could have revealed the SEC inquiry last week but did not disclose it=
 until yesterday, and for many investors, that was the last straw, Feygin s=
aid.
The stock closed yesterday at $20.65, down $5.40, as 36 million shares chan=
ged hands.

Enron Suffers After Unclear Disclosure, New York Times Says
2001-10-23 06:31 (New York)


     Houston, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission's decision to look into some Enron Corp.
transactions and the company's recent decline in value show what
can happen when a company lets a major reduction in its balance
sheet dribble out, Floyd Norris of the New York Times reported in
his column, citing analysts.

     Investors are concerned as to how Enron reduced shareholders'
equity by $1.2 billion and why this was not mentioned in a news
release the company issued with its quarterly earnings last
Tuesday, the paper said.

     Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21 percent yesterday after the
Houston-based company said the Securities and Exchange Commission
requested information on partnerships run by Chief Financial
Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Enron created
partnerships and other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets
such as power plants to lower the debt on its books.

     ``Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more
clarity about how the company goes about its business,'' said
Ralph Pellecchia, a credit analyst at Fitch Investors Service,
according to the Times.

SEC asks Enron for investing data=20
Stock price declines as regulators seek details on partnerships=20
By LAURA GOLDBERG=20
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle=20
Shares in Enron Corp. fell almost 21 percent Monday after the company discl=
osed federal securities regulators asked for details on investment partners=
hips formerly run by its chief financial officer.=20
The request covers transactions between Enron and two private partnerships,=
 LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that did business with Enron.=20
The partnerships entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements wi=
th Enron.=20
Enron declined to say if the SEC's request -- which it called voluntary and=
 said represents an "informal inquiry" -- included other issues.=20
The SEC request, made by fax Wednesday to Enron and followed up with a call=
 Thursday, comes as the Houston-based energy trader was already fighting to=
 put a series of problems behind it and regain credibility with investors a=
nd analysts.=20
"It's further bad news, further question marks related to Enron in general =
and this transaction specifically," Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzban=
k Securities in New York, said of the SEC request.=20
Some investors prefer to sit on the sidelines until the issue clears up, Me=
ade said, adding: "The level of uncertainty with this stock has gotten pret=
ty high."=20
An SEC spokesman declined comment.=20
Enron's Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, managed both of the LJM par=
tnerships, according to SEC filings made by Enron last year.=20
Both partnerships are described as investment companies that primarily buy =
or invest in businesses involved in energy and communications.=20
Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM partnerships in June amid criticism =
and questions from some on Wall Street about a potential conflict of intere=
st.=20
Investors worried Monday that Fastow's duty to Enron shareholders competed =
with his duties to LJM, Meade said.=20
In a written statement Monday, Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executiv=
e officer, said the company welcomed the SEC's request.=20
"We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity t=
o put any concern about these transactions to rest," said Lay, who reassume=
d the duties of CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned unexpectedly in August.=20
Enron said its external and internal auditors and attorneys reviewed the ar=
rangements, its board was fully informed of and approved the arrangements, =
which were disclosed in Enron's SEC filings.=20
The issue drew renewed interest from investors and analysts after Enron rel=
eased third-quarter earnings last Tuesday.=20
During the quarter, Enron took $1.01 billion in one-time charges to reflect=
 losses in its broadband, retail electricity and water investments.=20
The amount also included $35 million related to "early termination" of Enro=
n's relationships with the LJM partnerships.=20
During a call with analysts the same day, Enron said it recorded a $1.2 bil=
lion reduction to shareholder equity, or the shareholders' ownership stake =
in the company, as part of the LJM termination.=20
Enron declined to answer questions Monday about the LJM entities, including=
 those about their relationship with Enron or Fastow's role with them.=20
The day after Enron's third-quarter earnings release, the Wall Street Journ=
al ran the first of three articles highlighting the LJM partnerships, Fasto=
w and Enron.=20
The Journal's Friday report said LJM2 "realized millions of dollars in prof=
its in transactions it did with Enron," and that "Fastow, and possibility a=
 handful of partnership associates, realized more than $7 million last year=
 in management fees."=20
Shares in Enron, which closed last Tuesday at $33.84, ended the day Friday =
at $26.05. Then Monday, shares in Enron dropped by $5.40 to close at $20.65=
.=20
Anatol Feygin, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in New York, believes there were=
 no improprieties surrounding LJM.=20
"From inception, the LJM situation was obviously one that would raise eyebr=
ows," said Feygin, adding Enron anticipated that and made sure proper legal=
 structures were in place.=20
The LJM entities are what's known as off-balance sheet financing vehicles, =
he said. Generally, they allow a corporation to take on financial obligatio=
ns without having to report them as liabilities.=20
Feygin also said it appeared Enron intended to give Fastow an "opportunity =
to participate in the upside from these entities" to reward him.=20
Even though the LJM transactions have been disclosed by Enron, Meade noted =
that they are complicated, difficult to follow and their implications tough=
 to understand.=20
In transactions detailed in an SEC filing made by Enron last year, LJM Caym=
an received shares of Enron common stock and LJM2 acquired assets from Enro=
n.=20
Another filing last year said LJM Cayman and/or LJM2 acquired various debt =
and equity securities of certain Enron subsidiaries and affiliates.=20
Investors are also concerned about potential shareholder lawsuits as well a=
s equity commitments facing Enron from two other financing vehicles called =
Whitewing and Marlin, Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. Internati=
onal in Houston, wrote in a research note Monday.=20
If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, thos=
e equity commitments from Whitewing and Marlin could trigger steps that wou=
ld cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted.=
=20
At least two shareholders have already sued Enron's board in state district=
 court, while two law firms filed suit on behalf of Enron shareholders Mond=
ay in federal court seeking class-action status.=20
Carol Caole, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded E=
nron from a buy to a hold Monday primarily because of issues surrounding th=
e credibility of Enron's management.=20
Several times over the past six months, Caole asked specific questions of s=
enior Enron executives, she said. They denied problems existed, but six wee=
ks to two months later it was revealed there were, indeed, issues, she said=
.=20
Coale recently asked about an SEC investigation and was told there wasn't o=
ne. But, she said, it turns out it's an "inquiry," not an investigation.=20

Minnesota Mining and GM Climb In a Rally That Builds Late in Day

NEW YORK -- During yesterday's Wall Street rally, investors responded with =
accommodation toward the release of third-quarter earnings results and four=
th-quarter forecasts.=20
Shares of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing added $5.22, or 5.1%, to $107.39=
 after the manufacturing company released third-quarter earnings, which nar=
rowly edged out analysts' projections, and spoke frankly of the challenges =
the company continues to face this quarter in light of economic weakness.
Despite this kind of hesitation about the economy's outlook, investors grav=
itated toward some of the manufacturing and capital-equipment stocks that t=
end to struggle during periods of weak economic activity. Shares of General=
 Motors, for example, added 1.21, or 2.9%, to 42.57, Alcoa gained 1.16, or =
3.7%, to 32.83, and Fluor, an engineering and construction company, rose 1.=
79, or 4.2%, to 44.77.=20
Stock averages initially struggled for direction, reflecting some skepticis=
m about the sustainability of the market's recent success, before turning f=
irmly higher in the final two hours of trading. Trading levels thinned out,=
 as well; on the New York Stock Exchange, less than 1.1 billion shares chan=
ged hands, compared with 1.2 billion shares Friday, an options-expiration s=
ession.=20
Nevertheless, market averages posted impressive gains. The Dow Jones Indust=
rial Average improved 172.92 points, or 1.88%, to 9377.03. The Nasdaq Compo=
site Index gained 36.77 points, or 2.2%, to 1708.08.=20
"We had another one of those days where there is a lack of liquidity, so an=
y moves, in either direction, just get exaggerated," Bob Basel, senior trad=
er at Salomon Smith Barney, said yesterday.=20
Shares of semiconductor companies, including makers of both chips and chip-=
making equipment, rose sharply after a spending forecast from Intel, the le=
ading chip maker, proved less grim than some experts had anticipated. The c=
ompany said its capital spending could be cut 10% to 20% in 2002 from this =
year's levels; that wouldn't be as severe as some chip industry experts had=
 forecast.=20
Shares of Applied Materials advanced 2.22, or 6.8%, to 34.77 on Nasdaq, whi=
le KLA-Tencor gained 2.74, or 7.5%, to 39.25, and Lam Research improved 1.3=
6, or 7.8%, to 18.80, all on Nasdaq. Among chip makers, Analog Devices rose=
 2.57, or 7.1%, to 38.74, LSI Logic gained 89 cents, or 5.6%, to 16.83, and=
 Texas Instruments tacked on 1.17, or 4.2%, to 28.91. For its part, Intel r=
ose 1.15, or 4.8%, to 25.30 on Nasdaq.=20
Shares of Lexmark International dropped 5.58, or 11%, to 44.77. The Lexingt=
on, Ky., maker of computer printers reported third-quarter results that mat=
ched Wall Street's forecasts, but warned that it continues to face sluggish=
 demand in the fourth quarter.=20
SBC Communications declined 2.24, or 5.1%, to 41.40. The telecommunications=
 service provider reported third-quarter earnings that fell short of analys=
ts' forecasts, and warned that the company won't show "meaningful growth" n=
ext year.=20
Citrix Systems fell 4.14, or 16%, to 21.08 on Nasdaq. Dain Rauscher reduced=
 its rating on the Fort Lauderdale, Fla., maker of computer networking prod=
ucts, saying the company faces competitive pressures from products introduc=
ed by rival vendors.=20
Jabil Circuit eased 16 cents, or 0.7%, to 22.90. The St. Petersburg, Fla., =
contract electronics maker adopted a so-called shareholder rights plan, whi=
ch is aimed at preventing an acquirer from gaining control of the company.=
=20
EMC advanced 68 cents, or 5.9%, to 12.19. The Hopkinton, Mass., maker of da=
ta-storage systems signed what was described as a multibillion-dollar enter=
prise storage agreement with Dell Computer. Dell improved 50 cents, or 2.1%=
, to 24.55 on Nasdaq.=20
SeaChange International advanced 88 cents, or 3.6%, to 25.03 on Nasdaq, boo=
sted by an upbeat research note from Dain Rauscher, which said the Maynard,=
 Mass., provider of video-on-demand technology figures to have posted an up=
beat quarter.=20
Lucent Technologies declined 20 cents, or 2.8%, to 6.90. UBS Warburg, in a =
research note, expressed some caution about the outlook for the telecommuni=
cations equipment maker's quarterly results.=20
Emerson Electric gained 1.38, or 2.8%, to 50.27, even though the St. Louis =
manufacturer, which makes electronics and telecommunications products, amon=
g other product lines, reduced its earnings guidance for fiscal 2001.=20
Enron lost 5.40, or 21%, to 20.65, setting a 52-week low. The Houston energ=
y trader, whose stock has weakened since recent articles in The Wall Street=
 Journal raised questions about the company's relationship with two limited=
 partnerships organized by its chief financial officer, said it had receive=
d a request for information on Wednesday from the Securities and Exchange C=
ommission regarding some of its transactions with those partnerships.

Milberg Weiss Announces Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp.

10/22/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 22, 2001--The law firm of Milberg Weiss Ber=
shad Hynes & Lerach LLP announces that a class action lawsuit was filed on =
October 22, 2001, on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Enron Corp=
. ("Enron" or the "Company") (NYSE:ENE) between January 18, 2000 and Octobe=
r 17, 2001, inclusive. A copy of the complaint filed in this action is avai=
lable from the Court, or can be viewed on Milberg Weiss' website at: http:/=
/www.milberg.com/enron/=20
The action, numbered H013630, is pending in the United States District Cour=
t for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, located at 515 Rusk=
 Street, Houston TX 77002, against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K=
. Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge pre=
siding over the case.
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally-held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.=20
If you bought the common stock of Enron between January 18, 2000 and Octobe=
r 17, 2001, you may, no later than December 21, 2001, request that the Cour=
t appoint you as lead plaintiff. A lead plaintiff is a representative party=
 that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In=
 order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the cl=
ass member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and tha=
t the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circu=
mstances, one or more class members may together serve as "lead plaintiff."=
 Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the dec=
ision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain Milberg W=
eiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, or other counsel of your choice, to serve =
as your counsel in this action.=20

Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP, a 190-lawyer firm with offices in=

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)
2001-10-22 18:04 (New York)

Janus Had Biggest Enron Stake at End of 2nd-Quarter (Update1)

     (Adds Stilwell shares at bottom.)

     Denver, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Janus Capital Corp., whose
stock funds have lost more than a third of their value this year,
may get another jolt from Enron Corp.

     As of June 30, Denver-based Janus was the biggest
institutional holder of Enron, owning 42.8 million shares, or a
5.71 percent stake in the largest U.S. energy trading company,
according to Thomson Financial/Carson.

     Enron shares have fallen 39 percent over the past four days
on concern that the company's dealings with partnerships run by
its chief financial officer contributed to investment losses. The
Securities and Exchange Commission has asked for information on
the partnerships, Enron said.

     Janus, which boosted its Enron stake in the past year in an
effort to diversify its technology-heavy stock funds, is among a
handful of firms including Putnam Investments, Alliance Capital
Management, Barclays Global Investors and Fidelity Investments
that owned more than 2 percent of the Houston-based company as of
June 30, according to Bloomberg data.

     ``It was definitely a real growth darling,'' said Christine
Benz, a senior analyst at Chicago-based fund tracker Morningstar
Inc. ``In a year like 2000, when almost nothing was working for
growth managers, Enron emerged as a story that a lot of growth
managers could like.''

                           Fund Holdings

     According to Thomson Financial, 1,187 mutual funds, or 15.4
percent of all U.S. stock funds, owned a combined 207.9 million
Enron shares as of June 30. Combined losses on the holdings amount
to $2.7 billion since Tuesday.

     According to the latest available data compiled by Thomson,
the biggest fund holders of Enron were: Janus Fund, with 2.15
percent; Janus Twenty Fund, with 1.19 percent; Alliance Premier
Growth Fund, with 1.14 percent; American Century Ultra Fund, with
1.01 percent; Janus Mercury Fund, with 0.88 percent; Vanguard 500
Index Fund, with 0.82 percent; Fidelity Magellan Fund, with 0.73
percent; AIM Value Fund, with 0.6 percent; CREF Stock Account,
with 0.58 percent; and, Putnam Investors Fund, with 0.52 percent.

     Janus Fund has lost 33.2 percent this year through Friday,
while Janus Twenty Fund has lost 33.4 percent and Janus Mercury
Fund has fallen 34 percent. A Janus spokeswoman wasn't immediately
available to comment.

     Morningstar's Benz said she suspects Janus fund managers have
already begun trimming their Enron positions.

     Enron shares had fallen 59 percent this year before last
week's news on concerns about financial reporting and money-losing
investments outside energy trading, such as trading space on
broadband telecommunications networks and building water treatment
plants.

     The stock fell $5.40, or 21 percent, to $20.65 in New York
trading today.

     ``Anecdotal evidence that I'm hearing from the fund managers
there is that they had been trimming pretty aggressively,'' said
Benz. She added that it's ``difficult to make the assertion that
they are in the clear.''

     Janus Capital is owned by Kansas City, Missouri-based
Stilwell Financial Inc., whose shares gained 73 cents today to
$22.52. Stilwell shares have fallen 43 percent this year.


Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)

Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)

     (Adds information on conference call in 26th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21
percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities and
Exchange Commission requested information on partnerships run by
Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships and
other affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as power
plants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron's
board Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35
million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict of
interest.

     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may be
forced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the
owners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he
may be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies
if Enron's debt ratings fall too far.

     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't go
below investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at John
Hancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.

     Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when it
repurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlled
by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journal
reported last week.

     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnerships
would cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, Ray
Niles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report to
investors today.

                           Shares Plunge

     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 during
the day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.

     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns about
failed investments in trading of space on fiber-optic
communications networks and a water company, and the resignation
of Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.

     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,
investors say his departure led them to question whether the
company was concealing problems, including possible liabilities
from affiliated companies.

     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a
$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01
billion in failed investments.

     Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watch
for possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investment
grade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.

     The company received a faxed request for information from the
SEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmer
said, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''

     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to
the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to
rest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.

                          Dilution Fears

     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financing
vehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texas
secretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named as
the controlling partners or the board members in the companies.

     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removing
the debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enron
to keep cash earned from the main trading business from supporting
what it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debt
analyst Todd Shipman said.

     Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and other
commodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gas
pipelines.

     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. Whitewing
Management, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron power
plants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000
preferred shares of Enron.

     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to common
stock if share prices fall below a certain level and the credit
rating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.
That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.

     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures are
out there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might have
to share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than they
originally thought.''

                        Worrisome Financing

     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's
``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and they
were disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.

     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholder
equity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason to
worry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, the
Salomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion in
losses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India and
projects in South America, he wrote.

                            Bonds Fall

     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per
$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 on
Friday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from
6.33 percent.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade.

     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,
Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman Karen
Denne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on the
agency's request to Enron.

     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and done
in connection with these transactions was considered and done,''
Lay said in the statement.

     Enron will hold a conference call to discuss investors'
concerns at 9:30 a.m. New York time Tuesday. The call may be
accessed through the ``Investors'' section of Enron's Web site at

Trusts Keeping Enron Off Balance

Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) stock plunged 20% last week after the =
energy giant revealed that a complex financing deal caused a $1.2 billion h=
it to its equity. But other big deals that have yet to receive much public =
scrutiny could further damage the company's balance sheet.=20
In the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnersh=
ips called LJM2 and LJM Cayman. An examination of the LJM2-related equity w=
ritedown can be found here.=20
However, the LJM deals make up only part of Enron's sophisticated financing=
 arrangements. Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron=
 shifted from its balance sheet. These are the $1 billion Marlin Water Trus=
t II and the $2.4 billion Osprey Trust, usually known as Whitewing.=20
The key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if th=
ey don't unwind as planned. The company may end up issuing stock to repay m=
oney borrowed through the trusts. This would dilute existing shareholders. =
Alternatively, Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on-=
balance sheet assets. But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and depr=
ive the company's profitable business lines of much-needed capital.=20
Whitewing and a Prayer?
Though set up by Enron, Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from t=
he company. Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts. The =
$3.4 billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron.=20
Both trusts are scheduled to unwind in 2003. Originally, Enron had hoped to=
 repay them by selling the trusts' underlying assets. This repayment method=
 would have had a minimal impact on Enron's balance sheet.=20
However, there's a potential problem brewing with this approach. The value =
of the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trus=
t investors. Hence Enron's two unenviable options: issuing stock, or raisin=
g cash from its own balance sheet.=20
Enron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II won't be suffi=
cient to pay it back. But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of on-ba=
lance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin I=
I. When asked if Whitewing's assets are adequate for repayment, Glisan repl=
ied: "We believe so."=20
In reference to the two trusts, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference =
call Tuesday: "We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source =
of repayments."=20
Sterling Marlin
TheStreet.com hasn't seen offering documentation for Whitewing; Enron didn'=
t provide it when requested. But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus.=
 Here's how Marlin II works. Enron took water assets, primarily based in th=
e U.K., off its balance sheet, and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them=
. Meanwhile, Marlin II issued senior debt to investors, the proceeds of whi=
ch went to Enron. The company didn't have to recognize these notes as debt =
on its balance sheet, due to the structure of the trust. Marlin II replaced=
 a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this ye=
ar.=20
Ideally, the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitabi=
lity of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell t=
hem off and pay down the trusts. To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn'=
t raise enough money, Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible p=
referred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes.=20
As it happened, the water assets didn't perform well. In fact, Enron set up=
 Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoi=
d paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock, or with cash from its=
 own balance sheet. This move risked angering the rating agencies that had =
agreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enron's pledge to backstop it=
 with preferred stock. Suddenly, it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its c=
ommitment to make good with stock.=20
Enron's Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also=
 invested in Marlin II, illustrating that investors weren't upset by the ma=
neuver.=20
Glisan says Enron almost certainly won't decide to issue stock to pay off M=
arlin II. Instead, he adds, money from pending asset sales can be used to p=
ay it off when it matures in July 2003. When asked if Enron might use the e=
xpected $1.9 billion in proceeds from selling Portland General, the utility=
 based in Portland, Ore., Glisan replied: "That's a good one."=20
But using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enron's freque=
ntly stated strategy of selling off low-yielding assets and investing the p=
roceeds in higher-yielding businesses. Portland General is almost certainly=
 a more profitable business than the U.K.'s Wessex Water, which is the domi=
nant asset in Marlin II. In addition, doing so would mean Enron couldn't us=
e all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt. Enron aims to get its debt-to-=
total-capital ratio down to 40%, from the current 50%.=20
Maturity
What about Whitewing, which matures in early 2003? Glisan lists Whitewing's=
 assets as: Central American gas distribution assets; turbines destined for=
 European power stations; interests in European power stations; and various=
 debt and equity participations in energy investments. Glisan says these as=
sets can be sold to pay off the $2.4 billion in notes issued by the trust.=
=20
But what would happen if the Whitewing assets can't fetch the necessary pri=
ce? Enron could sell off more on-balance-sheet assets. But, again, this wou=
ldn't help debt-reduction efforts, and it may be running short of large ass=
ets that it can quickly sell.=20
Whitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock. But Enron may be reluctan=
t to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs, and current s=
hareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution.=20
Investors also need to keep their eyes on the early-repayment triggers of t=
he trusts. In fact, the stock price-related element of the triggers has alr=
eady been set off. For Whitewing, the stock has to fall below $59.78; for M=
arlin II, the stock has to be under $34.13. However, something else has to =
happen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset =
sales and stock issuance. Enron's credit rating must fall below investment =
grade. That looks to be a long shot, since its rating is currently three no=
tches above subinvestment grade. But it is something the market will watch =
after Moody's said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a poss=
ible downgrade.=20
Despite all the questions stemming from the trusts, Enron still seems keen =
to use the structure. Last week, Barclays Capital was inviting investors to=
 subscribe to an Enron-related entity called the Besson Trust. This is bein=
g set up to enable Enron "to monetize substantially all of its interests in=
 EOTT Energy Partners," an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crud=
e oil. Expected proceeds from the deal are $227 million, according to the p=
rospectus. Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trus=
ts?=20
Due to off-balance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing, it's clea=
r that uncertainty could weigh on Enron's battered stock for some time.=20




Why Enron's Writedown Unnerves Some Investors
By Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>

Enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors, but its decision to red=
uce equity by $1.2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and conf=
usion in the market.=20
The action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner. More important, in=
vestors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enron's ba=
lance sheet, profits and earnings guidance.=20
Enron didn't provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction=
.=20
Enron doesn't include a balance sheet in its earnings release, so the equit=
y decrease couldn't be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday. And even though=
 Enron did break out $1 billion in earnings charges in its release, the com=
pany didn't feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in =
the text.=20
Instead, the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call. CEO =
Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a s=
o-called "structured finance arrangement." The Wall Street Journal later re=
ported that Enron's counter-party in this transaction was an investment par=
tnership called LJM2 Co-Investment, which has set up and run by Enron's fin=
ance chief, Andrew Fastow.=20
This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move: "In connec=
tion with the early termination, shareholders' equity will be reduced appro=
ximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding significant reduction in the nu=
mber of diluted shares outstanding." According to The Journal, Lay then sai=
d Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares.=
=20
Enron's supporters count Lay's mention of a reduction in the share count as=
 bullish, because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future.=
=20
But there are two possible problems with this theory.=20
First, Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to mak=
e $2.15 per share in operating earnings next year. Critically, the company =
did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the =
55 million shares or not. If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the =
55 million shares, the company should have upped its 2002 per-share earning=
s forecast by around 6%, since that's the amount by which the share count w=
ill be reduced. Enron needs to say what share count it's using in its guida=
nce.=20
Second, it's almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever re=
corded, casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay's assertion that the share=
 count will come down.=20
Why question the CEO? Well, in its 2000 annual report, Enron included some =
disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2. It reads: "At Dece=
mber 31, 2000, Enron had derivative instruments...on 54.8 million shares of=
 Enron common stock." The derivative instruments appear to be types of opti=
ons, or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stoc=
k at agreed prices.=20
But these derivatives-linked shares don't show up where they should in the =
annual report: in the table that breaks out the difference between the basi=
c and diluted share counts. The line item in this table that shows options-=
related shares totals only 43 million shares, which is close to the amount =
of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion. Therefore, that numbe=
r almost certainly doesn't include the 55 million LJM2-related shares. The =
fact is, at least some of the 55 million derivatives-linked shares should b=
e included if the derivatives were like normal options. That's because the =
LJM2 derivatives appear to have been "in the money", or profitable for the =
holders. Typically, all in-the-money options-based stock has to be included=
 in the diluted share count. And these LJM2 derivatives did appear to have =
that status at the end of 2000. Back then, Enron stock was trading around $=
80, way above the average $68 level at which these derivatives made money f=
or LJM2.=20
Maybe these weren't simple options and had other conditions attached that e=
xcluded them from the diluted share count. That's what disclosure elsewhere=
 in the annual report appears to imply. Alternatively, the options were emb=
edded somewhere else in the share count table or equity disclosure, though =
it's hard think where.=20
Presumably, investors will get a full explanation in Enron's quarterly fina=
ncial results filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, due by th=
e middle of November.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to "sponsor" every child in that school.  What we mean by "sponsor" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to "sponsor" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

Subject:	O&M costs

Eric,
The O&M costs seem reasonable.
The pipe O&M is usually very very low compared to that of compression.
Since the pipe is about 80% of the total capex, the composite effect the total O&M per total capital tends to be very small (1.1% in this case).

Within ETS, the pipe O&M is typically $500-600/mile/year
The non-fuel O&M is about $35/HP/year.
If we use these benchmarks we come in lower than their estimates.
Martin Donnelly has confirmed that fuel is not included in this estimate.. it is captured in the toll.

Please let me know if you require further detail.

VaR ($thousands)	159.4

Physical deals modeled in the Caminus Zainet system are deals which have some form of price risk, (i.e. Index to index deals, and anticipated fuel sales) This does not include standard transport or storage agreements.

P&L  Daily:   Daily change in the  mark-to-market (MTM) valuation of all deals being tracked in the Caminus Zainet system.  This includes the origination and changes in value for both the physical and financial sides of hedges, along with any speculative trades and floating unhedged physical positions.

VaR is "Value at Risk":  Enron Corp policy defines this as the maximum expected one day loss on the portfolio given a 95% statistical confidence interval.  This number is currently calculated on the Caminus system using a variance covariance methodology, rather than a Monte Carlo simulation per the Enron Corp policy.


More detailed reports are available from the Caminus Zainet risk management system.  Please call Vince Strohmeyer at 713.853.6701 with any questions you may have.
