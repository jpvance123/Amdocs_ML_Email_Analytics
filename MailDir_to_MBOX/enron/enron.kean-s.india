On Friday we plan to use the following statement, primarily in India, to 
respond to media inquiries and to counter the perception that recent events 
have increased the prospect for renegotiation concessions.  Please let me 
know if you need additional information or have comments.

As previously indicated, we expect to secure permission from the lenders to 
submit our preliminary termination notice PTN to MSEB.  It appears that this 
may occur today, but that the strongest likelihood is that we would have the 
submission going out on either Saturday morning or even stretching into 
Monday or Tuesday of next week.  

Attached is the statement we planned to use with the media.  We will keep you 
apprised of further developments.

Please let me know if you require additional information.

Here is the response from India, regarding the need to seek competition 
authority approval.  As you will see, Jane's response focusses on registering 
agreements, but her conclusion is that the focus would be at the Foreign 
Investment Board.  Let me know if you need more.  mcs

Subject: Re: Dabhol Reg Risk

Just had a preview meeting with Wade Cline and Neil McGregor (Pres. of DPC).  
They are very supportive of the effort and felt that, while "Jane, you always 
bring us such good news!" that the depth of analysis and real time concerns 
articulated was an excellent thing for the company.  In fact, they wanted a 
few more mitigants put in and then shot down, anticipating Jeff Skilling-type 
questions.  Thus, this regulatory risk idea if done in depth for each 
region/project, may be a bigger service for Enron than you guys had ever 
anticipated.  They also thought of one more tack to take on the renegotiation 
issue to figure out how far we could go.  Good deal.  (However, will still 
wear body armor/butt plate into the Sanjay meeting next Wednesday).

Further to my note of last Friday, attached is the full report on negotiating the sale of DPC prepared by our consultant (with considerable input from Business Controls).  Highlights of the 17-page report include consideration of how Tata would finance a purchase (page 11) and what leverage can be applied on Tata and its chairman (pages 15-16).  Included separately are a publicly-available analysis of Tata Power and an interview with Tata Power Managing Director Adi Engineer.  As always, if you would like anything additional, please let me know.

Jane,

As the lead on both the tariff issues as well as mega status, please provide 
me with the list of regulatory issues for discussion at this meeting.  Since 
I am in Houston, I may want to personally discuss these with you in early 
January.

Vrinda/Kelly, 

Please do the same with respect to the PR issues.  Perhaps, early Jan maybe a 
good time for me to get this list, so that I can discuss the same.

I will need the same to prepare the agenda and have the team prepare for the 
meeting.  

Ranabir/Rahul,

Mohan will be the lead on the finance side on the mega status, and my team is 
already involving him in our discussions.  Would you like to have him prepare 
a small list of finance issues ?

Sandeep (Katwala),

Please let me know of key things on the legal side for discussion.  You can 
update the group on the CERC forming Act.  Please jot me a small note on the 
legal  issues list when you get the message.

Also, I need to know who is likely to be on the ground from the regulatory 
side.  

Terry & Steven - Are you both going to be in town ?

Regards,
Sandeep.

Subject: MERC:Merit Order Dispatch


	

This memorandum is marked confidential because Mr. Subramanyam requested that 
this information be kept confidential.

In a meeting today after discussing an internal memorandum that was delivered 
to Mr. S. for his information, I was told that MERC does not plan to 
interfere in any way with the operation of merit order dispatch.  It will 
merely espouse economic dispatch in theory but defer to the operational 
expertise of MSEB.  Since MSEB avers in an Affidavit that it is already 
dispatching based on economic order, nothing will change due to interference 
by the regulator.  This ruling will obviously be in Dabhol's best interest.  
The recommendation has been dictated by MERC and, as he says, "We will not 
interfere with Dabhol."

Gentlemen:

The following appeared on Reuters today.  I actually think it is fairly 
helpful to our cause.

Jim

BOMBAY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The Indian government has asked the western state 
of Maharashtra to work out ways to pay outstanding dues to U.S. energy giant 
Enron Corp (NYSE:ENE - news), media reports said on Sunday.

Enron has threatened to invoke letters of credit (LC) and the federal 
government's counter guarantee.

``The state government has to work on the issue,'' the Press Trust of India 
said, quoting unnamed official sources.

The Economic Times on Sunday said that the lenders to Enron's local unit, 
Dabhol Power Company, were meeting on Tuesday in New York to discuss the 
inability of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to clear its dues.

``As a result of MSEB's mounting dues Enron said it would be forced to invoke 
the LC,'' the newspaper said.

The report said the MSEB had outstanding dues worth 2.62 billion rupees 
($56.15 million).

Enron's local unit said on Friday it will lower tariffs from next month in a 
bid to defuse criticism that it charges higher rates for the electricity it 
produces in Maharashtra state.

Last month, the Maharashtra government decided to review the rate at which it 
buys power from Enron's Dabhol Power, saying the high cost was threatening 
its finances.

Enron is spending about $1.9 billion to build a facility to generate 2,184 MW 
of electricity.

India, which needs to generate an additional 100,000 MW of power within the 
next decade to meet growing demand, is desperate to attract foreign capital. 
But after nearly a decade of liberalisation, Enron is among the few private 
power companies to begin generating power in India.

Thanks for the update.  Any suggestions on anyone we might retain if this 
becomes a big "government to government" issue?

Steve
 With regard to Dabhol, Tom Briggs and I have already provided a status 
briefing on the Dabhol situation to agencies across the government - 
including DoEnergy, DOCommerce,DOState and DOTreasury.  The briefing was with 
staff and brought them up to speed on where we stand.   As the new 
administration moves into the positions relevant to the situation we will 
brief them - all the way up to the cabinet officals.  I understand that Colin 
Powell has already been briefed on the situation  and I know the Ambasssador 
has been front and center on the issue.
 If we were to move into a crisis mode, we will need to brief senior officals 
of the new administration at each of the  above agencies as well as the VP's 
office.  Given their interest I think we will be able to do that quickly.
 We have also briefed OPIC and EXIM about the situation - they are 
comfortable at this point.
 I am also getting the World Bank re-engaged to the extent that it is helpful 
and not a problem.  They have resources that can help MSEB reform themselves 
if MSEB will view it has a help.  It is a sensitive issue because the Bank 
has historically been anti-Dabhol so I am taking it step by step.
 If you have any other questions just let me know.  thanks John

I was in India last week meeting with partners and we all agreed that the 
best thing to do to move ahead regarding the old unrecovered cash calls 
("joint interest billings") was to file an arbitration proceeding and get an 
objective  third party to settle the issue.  As you know, Reliance and ONGC 
owe EOGIL approximately  $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including 
interest on non-payment).  The arbitration notices reflected only the 
non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for RIL and ONGC 
respectively.   We finalized the drafting and dated the notices on July 29th 
and we delivered the official notice during business hours Monday July 31, 
2000.  This was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in 
other means, but as I noted to the OOC after the June meetings this was the 
only solution in the end.   While nobody likes to file arbitration, the good 
news is in the end all parties seen this as the only solution and as best as 
I can tell, at least internally ONGC and Reliance support this decision.  If 
the issue gets external, I don't know how any of the parties will respond.  
Our goal is to keep it as low keyed as possible, but this is India and I 
would expect someone to try to make a big issue out of it.

I will be in contact with John Ambler today to discuss the details of the 
submittal and to prepare for any response to the media that may be 
necessary.  While both parties were expecting the notice, it may leak into 
the media over the next few days.  Please defer any questions or comments to 
either John Ambler, Larry Morse or myself regarding this issue.  Until John 
advises us otherwise, our comment will be as follows;

" The parties (ONGC, Reliance and Enron Oil and Gas India Limited) have had a 
dispute on certain cost items and together we have agreed it is best for the 
joint venture to have this dispute resolved by an independent third party 
using the guidelines as set forth in the Joint Operating Agreement."

Mike Smalling in our office will coordinate this matter with John Ambler and 
the appropriate staff.   I will be available to respond if necessary and my 
contact numbers are as follows;

office-713-853-5934
pager 888-493-1770
cell 713-569-4713
home 281-320-2198

Larry, please make sure our office understands that only you are to comment 
on this and any other official E&P business in India and Wade/Sanjay would 
you share this note with the appropriate people in your office so nobody is 
surprised if something comes up.  Mike Smalling, John and/or I will keep you 
informed of any  relevant events.

	The results of the PM's visit to Washington and, with it, the opportunity for a dialogue between the two governments on Dabhol were disappointing, to say the least.
	As the PM was arriving White House lawyers made a determination that neither the President nor Larry Lindsey could speak to the Dabhol situation.  It was decided that Condi Rice would raise the issue with Mishra when they met on Thursday but she unfortunately did not.  The GOI apparently raised Dabhol in the Lindsey meeting but all he could do was hear them out and then explain that he could not discuss the issue.  Great impression!
	The PMO Secretary refused to meet with me once he learned no one from Houston could come up.
	OPIC is furious about the outcome.  OPIC leadership knows the project is about to be dropped in their lap.  We will be meeting in the next several days as they are travelling but I have already broached the idea that OPIC should approve a move to termination preemptively.  They understand where we are coming from but preliminarily are looking at a trip to India to meet with the GOI and explain what lies before them.  We also discussed their need to get clarification from the NSC as to where Dabhol stands in their list of priorities.  OPIC has to bring along the other parts of the Administration and it is unclear where they stand in light of the past week. Once Larson is back from Doha we will meet and sort out where State is on pressing the issue.
	All in all a good opportunity lost. Standard fare for a terrible week.  ohn

Subject:	Dabhol Washington Update 


	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening:

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week.  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:
	1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.
	2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.

	At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.
	Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.

	Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

I have just learned that the information on our declaring political force 
majeure for the Phase II testing issue was premature.  We have not made the 
declaration and, assuming it happens, it probably won't occur before late 
morning India time tomorrow.  Consequently, please keep this information 
Extremely confidential.  Scott, I know you will need to talk with Mark 
Koenig, but otherwise ask that we not discuss this with anyone outside this 
group.

Thanks,

Subject: Statements on India Actions

Scott, 

Per our discussion, attached are the statements relating to our recent 
actions in India.  They include GoI conciliation and arbitration notice, 
exercising GoM guarantees for January bill and accumulated "clean" interest, 
and declaration of political force majeure (PFM) over Phase II testing.  We 
expect press coverage on all of these item.  However, I am not sure that they 
have picked up on the PFM declaration, so I would appreciate your not 
proactively using the statement until we confirm that the information is out 
on this issue.   As the issues and our legal actions unfold I will continue 
to keep you informed.  As you know, we are trying to keep this information 
extremely tight until we have taken action.

Thanks,

John

		 Subject: EGEP/EOGIL Customs Duty Inquiry on Offshore Production

We were served summons by the Customs Office in Surat asking for meetings 
with our platform managers and on Dec.12th we sent two representatives 
(operations mgr & legal) to answer their questions.  Over a two day period 
they inquired about production and logistical issues and asked a number of 
questions regarding product delivery points, pricing formulas, etc.   In 
summary, they are trying to build a case that the gas and maybe even the 
crude we sell in India is subject to a 10-12% customs duty since it is 
produced outside of the 12 mile territorial limit.  They are trying to make 
the case that we are importing the gas and oil into India.  Obviously this is 
not the case and there is no merit for such consideration, but we don't want 
to let this idea get entered as a show/cause filing against Enron and our 
partners.  There would be remedies such as court or arbitration, but the 
timing to resolve this is probably 1-2 years.  Furthermore, this issue would 
most likely impact current efforts we have on-going.  Therefore, we are 
taking the issue very seriously and plan to meet in Mumbai next Thursday to 
chart an appropriate course of action.  Once we meet, we will get back to 
Cliff and Jim Derrick regarding our recommendation on Thursday morning 
December 21st Houston time.  Cliff and Jim, if you are planning to be out of 
the office, please drop me an e-mail where you can be reached.

Meeting in Mumbai next Thursday will be Chris Walker of Linklaters, local 
Indian counsel (Saberwal ?), myself, Mike Stewart, Dominic Carolan (EGEP 
legal), and certain representatives from EOGIL.  We would also like to have 
Jane Wilson(EIPL Gov't & Regulatory affairs for India) present if she is 
available.  Jane it is not mandatory that you are present, but if you can't 
attend could you send me an e-mail where I could reach you if necessary.  The 
meeting will be at EOGIL's office and Fatima Samuel will confirm the time and 
place once Chris Walker's schedule is known.  It is my understanding that 
Chris Walker will be in India on Tuesday and Wednesday working with Wade's 
group on other matters. 

This issue came up originally in 1997 right after we started producing gas at 
Tapti.  At that time we had 3 legal opinions prepared and the legal team 
tells me the positions were very strong in our favor on a variety of fronts.  
After a few meetings and a couple of letters the issue went away and never 
resurfaced again until now.  We suspect that this issue has been an open item 
since that time and for a variety of reasons (ongoing activities ?) someone 
feels it needs to be checked off the list.  Hence, the revived interest at 
this time.  

The reason we are giving this such a high level of attention is probably 
obvious, but the reason we want to act upon our plan immediately once we get 
together next Thursday may seem less necessary.  However, today our office 
received 3 more summons for 3 different people to report to Surat next 
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  This time they have asked for our 
production manager, logistics manager and lead accountant.  We have requested 
an extension due to the short notice and holiday season and expect to have it 
granted, but we will not know if it is postponed before Monday.   (If we have 
to go we will have legal counsel attend with the individuals named)  This 
level of back to back activity for a government office at this time year is a 
concern.  Going into the meeting with the legal guys on Thursday, we are 
thinking that we need to have a highly respected person(such as Saberwal) 
deliver  our message (to multiple groups, i.e., Surat customs, Ministry of 
Finance, Mopng) as to the lack of validity for this potential claim and what 
we would do if they proceed.   By Thursday I think we will have all of the 
necessary "color" on this issue and with the team mentioned above we will be 
able to develop the right plan of action.  However, due to the level of 
interest and activity of the Surat Customs group, we anticipate that our 
recommendation will be to move quickly, hence, my desire to contact Cliff and 
Jim next Thursday for approval to proceed.  

I have included Wade and Rebecca(EIPL) as well as Steve and John(PR) for 
information purposes at this time.    
This first stage plan we will be seeking approval for next Thursday will be 
to meet with certain people in an attempt to keep this from becoming an 
issue.  This should be a fairly quiet issue (for Indian standards) next week 
and even the subsequent meetings that I'm anticipating would take place in 
the following two weeks ought to be very low keyed items.  However, in India 
you never know and considering some of the existing press of recent we should 
get prepared and make sure we are co-ordinated.   John, following our 
Thursday decision we should probably talk about our plan so if you'll leave 
me a note where you can be reached, I'd appreciate it.  

In summary, the odds are we will be able to manage this and it won't become a 
big issue.  However, we need to take this very seriously and deal with it 
proactively and quickly before someone files something without understanding 
the consequences of the action.  I am leaving for India on Sunday and when 
possible I will pick up my mail.  I will also be checking voicemail if you 
need to leave a message.   I will be the Mumbai office on Tuesday, Thursday 
and Friday and in Delhi on Wednesday.

Subject: URGENT. Good morning to MSEB problems.

Here we go.  There are numerous press reports of a statement by Chief 
Minister Deshmukh.  Here are a few quotes from The Financial Express:

"Bowing to burgeoning pressure from its allies, the Democratic Front (DF) 
government in Maharashtra, in principle, has agreed to review the second 
phase of the 2,184-m Dabhol power project and its sale of power to the 
loss-making Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB).  Simultaneously, the 
state government has also agreed to look into the possibility of scrapping 
the revised power purchase agreement signed by the previous Shiv Sena-BJP 
government on December 9, 1998, with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC).  Talking 
to newspaerson on the eve of the winter session of the state legislature, 
which starts on Monday at Nagpur, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh confirmed 
this and added that the project, which was envisaged to tackle the power 
shortage of the stat, seemed to have defeated its purpose because of its 
prohibitive costs which the consumer may have to bear.  

The constituents of the DF government, comprising the Peasants and Workers 
Party, Janata Dal (Secular( and the Communist Party of Inida (Marxist) have 
been pressing for the cancellation of the Dabhol project on the grounds that 
it would impose further financial burden on the ailing MSEB and ultimately on 
the state government, which is also reeling under severe financial crunch.  
These allies were of the view that the scrapping of the PPA will not be a 
major issue as such agreements with multinationals have been scrapped in 
Pakistan, Turkistan and Indonesia.  

. . . ."

The team is assembling tomorrow morning at 9:00 at DPC to talk strategy.  
Attached is talking points I wrote up after working with Mohan Gurunath of 
DPC and Ananda Mukerji (EIPL -- Finance) and Jimmy Mogal (PR).  I sent around 
for others to add their input.


Query whether the CM's statement is actionable repudiation.  Paul Kraske 
(attorney for DPC) is looking into it.

Headline: "Enron phase-II: Mah Govt now has second thoughts ! 

By Abhay Deshpande

Nagpur, Nov 26:
Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh today announced that his 
government would do a re-think on implementation of the second phase of the 
Enron power  project in Maharashtra.

Addressing reporters here on the eve of the start of the winter session of 
the state legislature, Deshmukh said under today's condition, each unit of 
electricity was
 costing the consumer almost Rs. 7/- . The rate of electricity produced also 
depended on the dollar-rupee ratio so also the international prices of NAPTA. 

As such, there were chances that the rate of electricity could go up to as 
much as Rs. 20/- per unit. This would prove to be very exorbitant for the 
consumer in the state. 

The CM has now asked MSEB to go into the details of the agreement between the 
state government and Enron. He also indicated that his government was
preparing the legal grounds in case Enron took it to court if the agreement 
for the second phase was finally scraped. -cafemumbai Report

Mark,  

You may recall that the GSA between Metgas and RCF, a Govt. of India owned 
fertilizer company, was postponed at the last moment in March (please refer 
to below e-mail). The Metgas marketing team is cautiously optimistic that the 
GSA could now be signed next week, perhaps June 14.  An India only press 
release was approved by the India team and Corp. in March but as that was 10 
weeks ago,  I wanted to ensure that this action is still approved.   Please 
let me know if you have any questions."

Please be advised that we will not be signing the GSA with RCF this week. The

Chairman of RCF is ill and his Board could not meet in time to give final 
approval to the deal. We will now sign at a later date.

We are still on track to sign the GSA with Ispat on Friday evening in Mumbai. 
The Shareholders Agreement will also be signed but the PPA will follow 
several days later. Only a press release for the Ispat deal will therefore be 
released on Friday, in India only.

I will keep you informed of any new developments.

Subject: Mega power status

There may be no advantages for us in this megaproject status other than the 
privilege of becoming fully regulated.  However, the Ministry is considering 
us and Ken Lay made big announcements to the press.  After these 
announcements, I pulled a team together on Dabhol strategy.  The conclusion 
was that now that we've made our application and annoucement (noone asked 
me.  See below), we must keep up the pretext of appearing to seek the mega 
project status to look like we are trying to help  MSEB.  The consensus of 
the group was that probably the whole idea of megaproject status will bite 
the dust.

Unbenownst to me, a number of letters were filed (with the Ministry, with 
MSEB and with CERC) requesting mega power project status.  A letter was filed 
with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) requesting that 
CERC "use its good offices" to obtain this status for Dabhol.  In a public 
forum -- a panel that I moderated at a conference, Dr. Rao referenced this 
letter as one filed by a "multinational" corporation that wouldn't have filed 
it in its own country, improperly asking for the use of influence.  When he 
sat back down next to me, Dr. Rao leaned over and whispered that it was 
Enron, that the name was Sandeep Kohli, and that he was certain I didn't know 
about it.  I subsequently formally requested its withdrawal, much to Rao's 
relief.  This was Sanjay's idea.  

P.S. it's hot in Mumbai now -- about 90 degrees or so in the daytime.

Subject: Mega power status

Here is the hand out on mega power project that I handed out in our strategy 
meeting in January.


Please note that in the Monday, January 24 Business Standard it was reported 
that the next tranche of mega power projects may get no tax benefits.

 "The Union power ministry may not offer tax sops to the projects presently 
under consideration for mega power project status. 
  Official sources confirmed that the new projects would not be offered 
benefits like customs duties waiver, offered to the mega projects cleared 
last year.
 The only benefit these projects are expected to receive is sale to the Power 
Trading Corporation (PTC) -- whereby the state risk on independent power 
producers (IPPs is transferred to PTC.  Such sops do not have a major impact 
on the project's tariff, as was initially calculated.
 The power ministry is considereing a proposla to accord mega status to eight 
projects, including the Dabhol venture in Maharashtra.
 . . . .
 Sources however, said mega project status would onl be granted on the basis 
of the tariff quoted by the projects under consideration.
 The Union power ministry has already formed a committee which will analyse 
the tariffs for these projects so as to accord them the status.  They said 
that the committee would be examining the tariffs in accordance to similar 
project cleared by the Central Electricity Authority.  
 . . . 
 Mega power projects are large interstate power venture selling power to more 
than one state through the Power Trading Corporation.
 The 18 projects that have been notified as mega power projects get special 
benefits in terms of the customs duty waiver and will enable te government to 
obtain competitive tariffs from projects.  These project also get deemed 
export status wherein domestic equipment suppliers will be entititled to duty 
drawback and refund of terminal excise duty."

I now have the Availability Based Tariff Order (issued prior to my being 
involved in India) and will analyze it.  This order will apply to mega power 
projects as you see in the handout.  I want to do a full regulatory analysis 
for us in the next month.  

Please let me know what our current strategic thinking is on the mega project 
issue.  I still think that this would not be to Enron's advantage.  However, 
being realistic, something will have to change.  I just don't think 
submitting ourselves to regulation by the CERC with one buyer the PTC is to 
our advantage anyway.  With potentially no tax advantages, what are we 
thinking?  However, as we discussed in the meeting, we must continue the 
pretext.  What happens if the dog catches the car?

On a separte subject, I know you are busy with the refocus of our development 
efforts, but obviously I would like to spend some time with you with regard 
to my reassignment to the India region only (at my suggestion, by the way).  
Since I'm returning to the US on Thursday night, the 18th, we may have no 
face time until my return the 28th.  Is that right?

Is the therapy couch ready in your office?  From what I hear from my perch in 
the TERI forum in Agra and Delhi (now Mumbai) there is lots of doom and gloom 
in the Mumbai office.  Certain resumes are being prepared, and there seems to 
be a general feeling that Enron will embark on a several-year wrap up/sell 
down effort.  

I am planning to go to the South Asia forum in Kathmandu.  Even with our 
refocus, it strikes me that the contacts with DOE and Indian embassy and 
Indian personnel will be most worthwhile.  Let me know if you disagree.

Jane,

Please send me via e-mail or fax a copy of the note you put together and 
presented a few Saturdays ago. This was the note about that had the checklist 
of items required for a project to be a mega project and had the status of 
DPC on each item.

Rebecca
 We had a good meeting with OPIC last week.  They are sympathetic to our 
situation and inclined to support the PNT, with certain particular concerns 
stemming from the fact they are a government agency, as I am sure you have 
been briefed.  But an issue they raised - how do we plan to proceed so as to 
get the Indian players to the table as we move to issuance of PNT - is a 
critical one now to ponder as we ratchet up the signals through the legal 
steps we are taking.
 If I might, some thoughts on this process, and I hope they help your 
thinking.

  1.  My conversations with the Embassy last week indicate that they 
understand the message we are sending and are eager to get into a dialogue 
beyond the discussions with Wade about the invocation of the counter 
guarantee for each month's payment.  That is one reason they are eager to set 
up a meeting with Ken for the 27th with the Finance Minister. The Ambassador, 
I think reflecting a view of the Centre, was seeking assurances that we were 
not going to leave the country but remain engaged with them in seeking a 
"typically convoluted Indian solution to the problem" (His words).  I think 
at very senior levels the government does not want to be left having to sort 
out the solution themselves, while also bearing the international political 
ramifications of the departure of a major American investor.
       So I think the Centre wants now to engage with us in a dialogue to 
find a solution.  But I think they do not know quite where we stand at this 
point and whether we want to talk.  The legal steps certainly can point to an 
intent to leave, and I think the Indians now need a signal from us - 
preferably in private.
 2.  The Centre also does not genuinely know how to solve the problem.  So I 
think we need to have ready a proposal that can serve as the basis for 
concrete discussions, and that we not give up a lot in the process.  But we 
need to convey to the Centre that we have concrete ideas for solving the 
problem.
 3.   There needs to be a political communication path between Delhi and 
Houston that parallels the legal/payment communication path Wade is so ably 
handling.  The Centre cannot differentiate the roles Wade is handling so I 
think they undervalue the more political messages.  They are looking for Ken 
and yourself to handle the higher level communications, or an agent directly 
representing you to do so.  Only such a person will be able to meet with the 
Finance Minister at the end of the month.  I understand Prabu is viewed as 
competent technically but not a power within the BJP, so a decision on 
negotiations will not be his.  The critical player at this point is Jashwant 
Singh, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defense and now also overseeing the 
Prime Minister's Office.  Sinha, the Finance Minister, will be more reluctant 
to engage on our issue because its politics are not in his realm - except for 
the finance issues.  But the timing of his visit and willingness to meet are 
positive to moving the dialogue forward.      
 4.  The GOM is the real problem.  The Embassy made some interesting comments 
about this issue.  It noted that we had not really called upon the support of 
the USG to date, and then, without directly saying so,  encouraged us to get 
the President and his Administration to weigh in.  The objective, I think, is 
to provide ammunition for the Prime Minister to call Deshmuck in and direct 
him to negotiate in the national interest.  We also need to underscore to the 
Centre that we have a window and that negotiations need to go forward now 
before we get boxed into our respective corners.

I hope this helps. Thanks John

Indian State to Review Power Agreement With Enron Unit, AP Says
11/26/0 19:12 (New York)


     Houston, Nov. 26 (Bloomberg) -- The western Indian state of
Maharashtra will review its power agreement with Enron Corp.'s
Indian subsidiary after the price of electricity has almost
quadrupled, Associated Press reported.
     The second phase of an agreement with Dhabol Power Co., the
Indian unit of the Houston-based natural-gas and electricity
company, will be reviewed, AP reported, citing Maharashtra's chief
minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh.
     Enron was one of the first big foreign companies to enter
India after the Indian government opened up the economy to foreign
investors in 1991.

At about 1415 hrs  it was reported that PLL workers have stopped work in Cove 
area and have  assembled in large number. Security was moved in immediately. 
It was observed that  about 700 plus workers were assembled  and PLL staff 
was making efforts to talk to them. The workers however were not in receptive 
mood and had started walking towards the LNG Office.  The crowd was though 
peaceful  was in agitated  mind. The situation was explained to  Mr  Kenneth 
Lambert and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar and  the SRP and State Police was mobilised 
to stop the labour force from advancing towards LNG Office Complex. Mr 
Sanjeev Khandekar and PLL  Project Manager Mr Pankaj Jain addressed the crowd 
and listened to their grievances.
Labours stated that 
(a) When they asked details of the final settlement amount paid to them,  
they alleged that  the staff was  rude.
(b) The Provident Fund Slips did not bear any stamp/signature and did not 
appear to be authentic.

Mr Pankaj Jain explained that they would receive a Hindi translated copy in 
future and Provident Fund statements would bear a office seal and signature 
too. The labour force was later pacified and asked to return to work.

The security has been alerted to monitor the situation in labour camps and 
job sites.

Bruce, it was good to hear that you will be here a lot in January (good for 
me, that is).  While Sandeep may have forwarded this to you already, when you 
mentioned legal proactivity on the MERC merit order dispatch issue, I thought 
it would be helpful for me to ensure that you saw the below e:mail.  I 
realize we are waiting for a legal opinion and assume we will all have 
further discussions on the issue after New Year's.

Subject: Merit order dispatch: what is the real problem

While I am in touch over the rest of the week, I remain more or less on 
vacation with my family.  Upon return after New Year's, Akshay and I will 
look at the items in italics below.  Of course, we cannot do analysis out of 
the context of the model.  Perhaps if you sent Akshay and me the model that 
is being used to work the answers to Jim's questions (one model or two?), we 
can see what we're working with currently.  

Please note the following:

1. Merit Order Dispatch in the Next Rate Case.Attached below is what my team 
(Robert Neustaedter) has drafted for the rate case filing on merit order 
dispatch.  There is a mistake on page 5 regarding the percentage TOP that 
needs to pass outside merit order dispatch (it's 75% rather than 78%).  
Further, we've asked Ramu to "Indianize" the text before we pass it back to 
Mr Palumvar.  Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC 
(or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC), and this filing should 
serve as a foundation for this rate case (and others).   


2. Merit Order Dispatch "Cap".  The May 5, 2000, order treats two concepts as 
one: the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs 
are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit 
order dispatch, which is  a day-to-day operational tool that determines 
actual purchases.  The rate case order of May 5, 2000, as written, did not 
"cap" the quantities.  What the rate case stated (and I am not quoting) was 
that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long 
as the average realisation exceeded the cost.  I would also argue that the 
India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further 
dispatch quantities.  The "catch" is in two places:  first, whether dispatch 
of DPC power meets the test (Shubh told me recently it did -- does this 
continue to hold true, Mohan?), and second, the recovery of the power 
purchase costs due to the variance (the difference between what is authorized 
in the order and what is actually dispatched.)
3. Recovery of Variance. According to Mr Podder, the Electricity Supply Act, 
1948, does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the 
next.  (Typically, the variance is just included in the next rate case.  This 
practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs 
for a period of time, which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to 
understate demand.  We have approached the MSEB  rate case, however, with a 
different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more 
funds for MSEB to pay its bills.)  As provided in the Act, the variance must 
either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB.  This is a major 
financial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI.  Mr. Podder is 
writing down the accounting legal basis in Act, and I will forward that memo 
to you.
4. MSEB Representation regarding dispatch.MSEB clearly discusses its failure 
to dispatch more than 3044 MU with us in the rate case process.  Mr. Palumvar 
and Mr. Bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply 
a matter of budget.  The cost of 3044 MU is incuded in the rates, and the 
cost of additional volumes isn't.  Since there is no way for MSEB to collect 
the cost for additional volumes other than from the State, it is logically 
not dispatching additional volumes.
5. MERC Jurisdiction. Thus, I have a query: let's assume that the MERC does 
not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order 
dispatch or to determine a blend of the two.  I'm not sure how that will help 
MSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases.
6. Logical Area of Focus. In my opinion, once Sandeep Katwala and team 
confirms our interpretation of the Act, the most beneficial course of action 
would be to work with the regulators/Government/anyone else to repair the 
cost recovery mechanism of the Act.  This helps DPC, this helps MSEB and 
will, in the end, help the country.

Might be worth considering.

Subject: Re: Dabhol question  

Mohan,

I have gone through your note, and agree with the concept.  

You do have to compare end-user tariff with costs till end-user, which will 
include T&D losses.
You have assumed 30% loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement 
(since this is the worst case scenario) 
Your assumptions on Rs. devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be 
for a pessimistic scenario
You have assumed that MSEB's average realization per unit in $ terms actually 
goes down due to Rs. devaluation

There are some areas where Jane can shed more light:
MSEB can increase its average realization, simply by limiting supply to agri. 
customers, and by not giving any new unmetered connections
The latter is something that has been decreed by MERC (Jane please correct me 
if I am wrong), while the former was the most likely cause for Bhave's exit
Jane - Can you (with Akshaya's help) take a crack at what the agricultural 
load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years 2002 through 2004 
?  Similarly, what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories?
Also, if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai (following 
Mohan's conclusion of 75% PLF on  2400 MW), and the plants close to 
Chandrapur were to despatch less, what would be the overall T&D loss picture 
?  
The question to answer here is what portion of the 30% is theft, and what is 
actual T&D loss.  My understanding is that betwen 16-18% is actual T&D loss 
due to the poor state of the network.  Further, we will have to ask the 
question whether the actual T&D loss is more due to distribution or due to 
transmission.  My gut feel is that it is due to distribution.
The next logical question to tackle then would be what you see as the 
improvement in distibution between now and 2004.  Jane - Can you take a crack 
at that ?

Mohan - My gut feel is that there will not be a 75% despatch on all three 
blocks.  I can envisage that type of despatch in Block B, but that will be 
the optimistic rather than the pessimistic scenario.  I do not see C being 
used more than 6-8 hours daily, and that too only in the peak season.  I had 
started the team working on a stack and peak and off-peak load curves.  We 
need to do more on that.

Bottom line is that we need much more detailed information on the T&D sector, 
on the pace of reform, and most importantly on merit order deptaching of the 
plants (building the stack of plants).  This was Jim's concern too when we 
met this morning, and we will need to develop a plan to move that forward 
further.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Wade:

I am sure you guys are getting tired of questions.  However, here is one more.

I was thinking about how to determine our worst case.  While considering 
this, I came up with a question I couldn't answer:  What is our breakeven 
power price at the overall PLF we think would be achieved if MSEB used 
marginal economic cost dispatch.  If we determined that this price was at or 
above the realised tariff of MSEB, then we know ultimatley we will survive, 
the only question is how long it takes us to get our equity back.  If it is 
below, then the situation may be dire indeed.

Steve,

I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India.  There 
are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by 
six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate 
contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 
40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by 
location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By 
company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three 
dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; 
DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to 
trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce 
the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.

We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best 
possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the 
event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of 
all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale 
evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon 
season has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number 
of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by 
individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same 
resources.

As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in 
the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and 
offices there.

Dave

Rebecca / Jim:

Attached is a final draft media statement on DPC's reaction to the 
recommendations of the Godbole energy review report. As you know, the report 
was submitted last week to the Government of Maharashtra and has generated 
widespread media interest both in India and internationally.

Wade and the India legal team have approved the statement but we would be 
grateful if you could let us know if you are comfortable with the statement 
before we distribute it to the Indian media, currently planned for Wednesday 
morning (late evening Tuesday in Houston). 

Thanks,

Johan

Scott Bolton and I have spent the week with Enron India communications 
employees, reviewing the regulatory environment with them and even attending 
one meeting with TRAI with regard to issuance of the long-distance policy 
regulations.  

We see the high level regulatory issues as four-fold:
1. Issuance of the TRAI policy regulations.
2. Obtaining a license for Enron pursuant thereto.
3. Lobbying to open up the VSNL international landings without failing to 
support the sanctity of contract cncept.
4. To the extent possible, lobby to remove the 49/51% ownership requirement 
for the data center.  This issue falls more into the legal/financial 
structuring  arena than gov't affairs/regulatory; but we will fully assist 
the search for a solution.

Steve Kean already plans to hold a meeting with regard to overall India 
Government and Regulatory Affairs issues when I am back in Houston next 
week.  These communications issues will be added to the list of issues to be 
addressed.

To those of you who gave Scott and me your time, thank you.   I, and through 
me, Scott, look forward to working with you all.

Revised (continually being revised) customs risk assessment.  The note will 
help get a handle on the facts.  India is upping the quality/number of legal 
folks assigned to this (praise the Lord).  I will bet, however, that before 
we are through, we may be back to a higher number.  But let's hope not.

Attached is a note on the facts of the Customs issues as I understand them as 
requested by Sandeep Katwala.  Also attached is a draft risk evaluation put 
together by Heidi Hellmann.  Please note that two issues are not yet 
evaluated and thus are not included in the risk evaluation: (i) loading a 
portion of the services agreement to the supply agreement that is 
attributable to power (at a 22.38% duty rate); and (ii) contractor delay 
claims.

The IFIs have filed a suit in India seeking to compel various parties to meet their obligations under the PPA, but more importantly to prevent DPC from terminating the PPA and proceeding with arbitration.  The initial legal review is that this will strengthen our case on a number of fronts even though it may result in short term inconvenience.  However, we need to be cautious in the way we present this.  We intend to respond to media inquiries on this issue with the attached statement.  Please let me know if you need additional information.

Steve,

Attached is Business Controls' assessment of factors that could cause a 
significant deterioration in the security posture at Dabhol.  Essentially, 
the likelihood of serious security problems seems to be low, but because the 
situation is both complicated and extremely fluid, it will need to be watched 
closely as matters move toward resolution.  We're continuing our on-site 
assistance in both Dabhol and Mumbai and fleshing out contingency plans for 
evacuation and other worst-case scenarios.  A hard copy of this document has 
been delivered to Rebecca McDonald.

A very senior attorney in Delhi (perhaps a retired Supreme Court justice?) 
has advised Enron that MERC has no jurisdiction over the PPA and cannot 
establish regulations on things like merit order dispatch, much less set the 
merit order dispatch.  A written legal opinion has been requested.  The 
thought of the Linklaters attorneys (both Sandeep Katwala and Chris Walker) 
and tentatively Wade is that the MERC may be DPC's worst enemy if it has 
jurisdiction over the renegotiated PPA (which it will) and must approve it; 
thus, it may be better to take the offensive and challenge its jurisdiction 
over merit order dispatch.    The strategy isn't fully formed yet, but I 
wonder about the wisdom of (i) taking on a regulator that could be in a 
position to approve a renegotiated PPA; and (ii) how a jurisdictional 
challenge to a regulator attempting to restructure squares with Enron's 
positions/reputation worldwide.  I'll be discussing this with all parties 
when I get back to work after New Year's and will let you know as this issue 
progresses.

Enron is as I speak seriously contemplating pulling the letters of credit.  
We've been told by the Chairman of MSEB that he has some money but he is not 
going to pay October's bill for DPC.  According to him, DPC was forced on 
MSEB by the Gov't of Maharashtra, so we should pursue our financial and legal 
remedies.  The Government of course will want to renegotiate in exchange for 
payment.  Here we go.

Subject: Merit order dispatch: what is the real problem

While I am in touch over the rest of the week, I remain more or less on 
vacation with my family.  Upon return after New Year's, Akshay and I will 
look at the items in italics below.  Of course, we cannot do analysis out of 
the context of the model.  Perhaps if you sent Akshay and me the model that 
is being used to work the answers to Jim's questions (one model or two?), we 
can see what we're working with currently.  

Please note the following:

1. Merit Order Dispatch in the Next Rate Case.Attached below is what my team 
(Robert Neustaedter) has drafted for the rate case filing on merit order 
dispatch.  There is a mistake on page 5 regarding the percentage TOP that 
needs to pass outside merit order dispatch (it's 75% rather than 78%).  
Further, we've asked Ramu to "Indianize" the text before we pass it back to 
Mr Palumvar.  Merit order dispatch has not been clearly treated by the MERC 
(or any other Commission other than the Gujarat ERC), and this filing should 
serve as a foundation for this rate case (and others).   


2. Merit Order Dispatch "Cap".  The May 5, 2000, order treats two concepts as 
one: the least cost purchase policy that determines what power purchase costs 
are included in the rates for the rate case period is equated with merit 
order dispatch, which is  a day-to-day operational tool that determines 
actual purchases.  The rate case order of May 5, 2000, as written, did not 
"cap" the quantities.  What the rate case stated (and I am not quoting) was 
that quantities in addition to those authorized could be dispatched so long 
as the average realisation exceeded the cost.  I would also argue that the 
India obligation to serve customers provides additional grounds for further 
dispatch quantities.  The "catch" is in two places:  first, whether dispatch 
of DPC power meets the test (Shubh told me recently it did -- does this 
continue to hold true, Mohan?), and second, the recovery of the power 
purchase costs due to the variance (the difference between what is authorized 
in the order and what is actually dispatched.)
3. Recovery of Variance. According to Mr Podder, the Electricity Supply Act, 
1948, does not allow a carryover of these volumes from one rate case to the 
next.  (Typically, the variance is just included in the next rate case.  This 
practice actually provides a utility with an opportunity to overrecover costs 
for a period of time, which is why the goal of a rate case is normally to 
understate demand.  We have approached the MSEB  rate case, however, with a 
different perspective in an attempt to get the revenues up to allow more 
funds for MSEB to pay its bills.)  As provided in the Act, the variance must 
either be subsidised by the State or absorbed by the SEB.  This is a major 
financial problem for the SEBs and should be rectified by GOI.  Mr. Podder is 
writing down the accounting legal basis in Act, and I will forward that memo 
to you.
4. MSEB Representation regarding dispatch.MSEB clearly discusses its failure 
to dispatch more than 3044 MU with us in the rate case process.  Mr. Palumvar 
and Mr. Bakshi state that failure to dispatch additional quantities is simply 
a matter of budget.  The cost of 3044 MU is incuded in the rates, and the 
cost of additional volumes isn't.  Since there is no way for MSEB to collect 
the cost for additional volumes other than from the State, it is logically 
not dispatching additional volumes.
5. MERC Jurisdiction. Thus, I have a query: let's assume that the MERC does 
not have jurisdiction to determine least cost purchases or merit order 
dispatch or to determine a blend of the two.  I'm not sure how that will help 
MSEB to recover the full costs of its power purchases.
6. Logical Area of Focus. In my opinion, once Sandeep Katwala and team 
confirms our interpretation of the Act, the most beneficial course of action 
would be to work with the regulators/Government/anyone else to repair the 
cost recovery mechanism of the Act.  This helps DPC, this helps MSEB and 
will, in the end, help the country.

Might be worth considering.

Subject: Re: Dabhol question  

Mohan,

I have gone through your note, and agree with the concept.  

You do have to compare end-user tariff with costs till end-user, which will 
include T&D losses.
You have assumed 30% loss figures which is assuming little or no improvement 
(since this is the worst case scenario) 
Your assumptions on Rs. devaluation are also aggressive as they need to be 
for a pessimistic scenario
You have assumed that MSEB's average realization per unit in $ terms actually 
goes down due to Rs. devaluation

There are some areas where Jane can shed more light:
MSEB can increase its average realization, simply by limiting supply to agri. 
customers, and by not giving any new unmetered connections
The latter is something that has been decreed by MERC (Jane please correct me 
if I am wrong), while the former was the most likely cause for Bhave's exit
Jane - Can you (with Akshaya's help) take a crack at what the agricultural 
load and unmetered customers are likely to be in the years 2002 through 2004 
?  Similarly, what is the likely growth in the metered cutomer categories?
Also, if Dabhol were to be despatched to the load center at Mumbai (following 
Mohan's conclusion of 75% PLF on  2400 MW), and the plants close to 
Chandrapur were to despatch less, what would be the overall T&D loss picture 
?  
The question to answer here is what portion of the 30% is theft, and what is 
actual T&D loss.  My understanding is that betwen 16-18% is actual T&D loss 
due to the poor state of the network.  Further, we will have to ask the 
question whether the actual T&D loss is more due to distribution or due to 
transmission.  My gut feel is that it is due to distribution.
The next logical question to tackle then would be what you see as the 
improvement in distibution between now and 2004.  Jane - Can you take a crack 
at that ?

Mohan - My gut feel is that there will not be a 75% despatch on all three 
blocks.  I can envisage that type of despatch in Block B, but that will be 
the optimistic rather than the pessimistic scenario.  I do not see C being 
used more than 6-8 hours daily, and that too only in the peak season.  I had 
started the team working on a stack and peak and off-peak load curves.  We 
need to do more on that.

Bottom line is that we need much more detailed information on the T&D sector, 
on the pace of reform, and most importantly on merit order deptaching of the 
plants (building the stack of plants).  This was Jim's concern too when we 
met this morning, and we will need to develop a plan to move that forward 
further.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Wade:

I am sure you guys are getting tired of questions.  However, here is one more.

I was thinking about how to determine our worst case.  While considering 
this, I came up with a question I couldn't answer:  What is our breakeven 
power price at the overall PLF we think would be achieved if MSEB used 
marginal economic cost dispatch.  If we determined that this price was at or 
above the realised tariff of MSEB, then we know ultimatley we will survive, 
the only question is how long it takes us to get our equity back.  If it is 
below, then the situation may be dire indeed.

Robert Mathis has prepared a draft of the letter to the lenders which 
essentially discusses most of the points highlighted in the presentation and 
thus we might decide not to include the presentation at all.  

However I would appreciate your comments at the earliest if we decide to

Wade/Rebecca,

Kyle Norosky and Gabriella Cigarroa will be arriving Monday evening in Mumbai.
Kyle will replace Mark Ringwelski at the Dabhol site.

Gabriella will handle some IT items and the remaining evacuation planning 
issues
in Mumbai, as well as address evacuation, IT network issues, and general
security items for Larry Morse at EOG.  Kyle's main task at the site will be 
to
integrate Lingtech and Bechtel's evacuation plans into a single plan under DPC
which we are putting together.  While it has been generally accepted that the
contractors would essentially fend for themselves in an evacuation, a review 
of
their plans suggests this would be impractical in an emergency.  We are taking
the position that, in an emergency, DPC should handle the movement of all 
expats
out of Dabhol.  To that end, we are organizing assets to accomplish this task.

That said, everyone should be aware that, with well over 200 expats at the 
site,
an immediate evacuation to escape an outbreak of violence at Dabhol is
impossible.  Moreover, I understand there is no funding available to 
construct a
passively defended location where expats could move to in the event of 
violence
in order to a) wait for the arrival of the authorities, b) wait for helicopter
transport, or c) wait for rioters to disband.  This, combined with the lack 
of a
credible security force, leaves Dabhol personnel extremely vulnerable.

At this time there does not appear to be an immediate danger of violence from
laborers, the surrounding community, or from political organizations.  
However,
as was demonstrated last weekend, this could change very quickly.

With that in mind, any of the following recommendations, if implemented, would
greatly enhance the safety of personnel at Dabhol:

1.  Drastically reduce the number of expats at Dabhol.

2.  Close the quarry and have those expats associated with it leave Dabhol.  
The
quarry is isolated and the expat workers there would be trapped in the event
violence.  In the not too distant past, a well organized, violent 
demonstration
took place at the quarry and indeed trapped the workers there.  Fortunately, 
the
violence was, for the most part, directed against equipment and buildings.

3.  Deploy a properly trained and equipped security force to Dabhol.  The
personnel at Dabhol now are little more than defenseless.  A force of 200 men,
trained, equipped, disciplined, and authorized to use force would be required 
to
properly address the potential problems at the site.

A formal report containing the evacuation plan alternatives and security
recommendations will follow.

Rebecca, Wade, and Steve,

We arrived in Mumbai Tuesday evening and have been at Dabhol since Wednesday 
evaluating the situation here.  At this time, we believe the most prudent 
course of action is for Wade to meet with the American Ambassador and 
ministerial-level officials in New Delhi in order to convince the Indian 
Government to deploy specialized security units within the Home Ministry to 
Dabhol as soon as possible.  At the same time, DPC and contractors should 
continue the measured drawn down of dependents and begin assessing a drawdown 
in both nonessential expat personnel and Indian national personnel.  Ken 
Lambert and the other members of the executive management team on site concur 
with these recommendations.   

The size and terrain of the Dabhol site make it completely indefensible. The 
local guard force working for DPC is not allowed to use force and is 
incapable of handling anything more than checking identification badges.  On 
the other hand, the Maharashtra state paramilitary forces (SRP) currently at 
Dabhol are poorly disciplined and have a history of human rights abuses.  
Moreover, as they are controlled by the politicians of this state, they 
cannot be trusted to react or not deliberately overreact.  While we are 
continuing to evaluate numerous short notice mass evacuation options, this 
remains highly problematic and possibly dangerous for a number of reasons 
relating to current and upcoming seasonal weather conditions, the size and 
remoteness of this facility, and the large number of expats currently on 
site.   We are convinced that the best course of action to ensure the safety 
of personnel at Dabhol is to obtain the cooperation of the Indian Government 
at the federal level and draw down personnel in the manner described above.   
This would obviate the need to execute a risky evacuation of large numbers of 
personnel under hostile conditions and would also provide a credible 
deterrent those seeking to incite violence.

We hope to discuss the above issues in greater detail with Wade on Monday 
morning and will brief Rebecca and Steve upon our return to Houston.  As we 
are travelling with only one laptop for security reasons, please address any 
responses to Gabriella Cigarroa.
     John

In advance of Ken's phone call to Ambassador Celeste in Delhi, I have 
prepared a brief one-page summary of the current situation as talking points 
for Ken.


 

For convenience, I also attach the talking points we provided to Ken's office 
in advance of his earlier conversation with the Ambassador.



Ashok Mehta in our Delhi office has spoken with the Ambassador. He is booked 
with official engagements on Monday evening, India time, but would be 
available on Tuesday morning, India time, 8:00am, which translates to Monday 
evening, Houston time, 8:30 pm. If this works for Ken's schedule, the 
telephone number he requested we call is -- 

US Embassy
011-91-11-419-8000
Tell the operator that this is a previously arranged call with Ambassador 
Celeste

For your information, I have a separate meeting with Ambassador Celeste on 
Thursday afternoon, January 11, in Delhi. At our request, he had earlier 
agreed to a full update on the Dabhol project. This update was originally 
scheduled for last Wednesday, but his schedule changed, and we rescheduled 
for this coming Thursday.

Steve,

As you are well aware, we are facing a lot of things happening fast in India. 
We are using several parts of your team, and are very pleased with most. I 
want to mention a couple of areas, HR and Security.

1. HR: I heard that some folks in Houston had raised concerns about the 
quality of the India HR team and their preparedness. The HR team is doing an 
outstanding job and I wanted you to hear that from me. Once we realized we 
had a major issue on our hand, and I received clearance from Rebecca and Jim 
to bring some HR folks into the loop, HR had someone on a plane within 20 
hours of my first call. We have always had great HR support through Drew 
Lynch and Bob Sparger, helping our team led by Sandip Malik, and this time 
Scott Gilchrist has joined in and helped as well. But the two workhorses have 
been Bob and Sandip. Bob got on a plane immediately and came over, and he and 
Sandip have been working around the clock so that we are much better prepared 
now than we were just a couple of days back. We really relied heavily on HR, 
and Drew had his team there for us.

2. PR: top notch team of John Ambler and Johan Zaayman, working with and 
supporting Jimmy Mogal on the ground. Johan and Jimmy have been a strong team 
on the ground, and John has provided leadership and all coordination with 
Houston. Great efforts and productive work.

3. Security: This area has not worked as well, and if you ever want feedback 
on our one-time experience with this group, I will provide it. I don't have 
any idea who is in charge from Enron's perspective here. There are 2 groups 
headed this way. Mike Hicks will arrive Thursday night, and Mike has informed 
us that he will be leading all security efforts. Jim Rountree is apparently 
travelling with Mike, and Don Hawkins sent me an e-mail earlier today telling 
me that Don has instructed Jim that Jim is in charge of coordinating our 
security. John Brindle has sent me an e-mail saying that you have asked him 
to coordinate and help in the ongoing efforts, and John is sending 3 people 
over arriving Saturday night. First, we are very happy to have the help, but 
I just hope that Mike, Jim and John know which of the three are in charge. If 
you could just let me know who you want to be in charge, we will coordinate 
with that person.

On a side note, the people who have really been helpful were brought in 
through Drew Lynch of Europe HR. They are Jim Roth and Dave Lawler, both of 
whom work for John Sherriff. They had a great attitude, were willing to work 
day and night and were planning on coming to coordinate until Mike decided he 
would come.

At Mike's earlier suggestion, we engaged Hill & Associates to help on 
security. Because I was having to meet with them 3 to 4 times per day, I 
asked Jane Wilson to help coordinate all our security efforts. Jane has done 
a fantastic job in an impossibly short time frame. The tasks she has been 
overseeing include coordinating with Hill & Associates, removing (in a lowkey 
yet rush manner) over 400 boxes of files and documents and getting them 
through customs and to Europe, removing 2 container truck loads of files from 
the Dabhol site and getting them out of the country, and overseeing a 
complete security check and file removal of all our electronic files from 
servers, desktops and laptops. In addition, she has coordinated security for 
all expats and families as well as worked with EOGIL expats and Anthony 
Duenner of EBS Asia.

Again, we appreciate all the help. 

Wade

Subject:	Dabhol Washington Update 


	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening:

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week.  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:
	1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.
	2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.

	At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.
	Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.

	Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

Attached below please find the cash flow/tariff increase study we discussed 2 
1/2 weeks ago at the Sunday DPC strategy session.  The study assumes a 
decrease in losses from 40% to 25% and an increase in collection efficiency 
83% to 92% from 2000-01 to 2006-07.  Further, it is assumed that only one 
block of DPC operates until 2006-07.  

Two scenarios based on average realisation are illustrated:

1. A realistic cash flow study and  accompanying tariffs.  Given the above 
assumptions and assuming there is no state subsidy in 2006-07, MSEB should 
have a cash flow deficit of R34 Cr. in 2006-07 when Phase II comes on line 
for sale to MSEB, given a reasonable annual tariff increase.  (See the tariff 
sheet in gray shaded area.)  The annual rate increases would be15% for LT and 
HT agriculture and LT public water works, a 10% increase for domestic, street 
lights and interstate sales, a 4% increase for LT industrial and powerloom, 
and 1% increase for LT commercial and HT industrial, public water works and 
railways.

2. The annual tariff increases needed for MSEB to break even with a 3% 
profit, assuming industrial and commercial classes are held flat, are 
detailed below.  (See the Tariff sheet in red.) 
 
 Domestic          8%
 LT Public Water Works    35.60% 
 LT Agriculture and Poultry   26% 
 Street Light     10.8%
 HT Agricultural & Poultry    26.9%
 Mula Pravara Electric Coop Soc.  24.30% 
 Interstate sales       6.5%

It is obvious that  even the more realistic scenario would require strong 
MSEB, state government and regulator resolve.

In a separate e:mail I will describe the cost of service study we have also 
developed for MSEB.

Jane,

Attached is the latest summary (hard coded numbers, like I sent before) and 
the latest cashflow model in case that is required for anything.

Just to confirm all that has changed are the customer categories and the MU's 
in 1999-2000.

A Deserved Downgrade, ( EDITORIAL)

THE rating assigned to four government of Maharashtra supported bonds has,=

Dear David,

I'm so glad you asked for an update!

We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill 
since your visit.  You will recall that in AMCHAM's briefing, it was 
positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been 
transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the 
restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets 
was attained.  Noone was 100 percent satisfied (probably the mark of a good, 
passable bill) but many  agreed to the draft and felt, while not perfect, it 
would achieve the desired reform.

We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill 
sponsored by the Ministry of Power.  The first has been developed by NCAER 
(NCAER draft) in a very transparent process with seven iterations and 
comments from 190 parties.  NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose 
by the Ministry of Power.  At the time of Draft III, a second draft (MoP 
draft) was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but 
not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process.  
It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been 
worked on by the Ministry of Law.

The draft, however, was never introduced in Parliament.  The industry 
discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to 
Minister Kumaramangalam's hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu 
heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or, at a minimum, allow a 
transparent commenting process on the MoP draft.  

Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft, and 
Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments.  (How widely it has been 
distributed is unknown.)  In addition, the death of the Minister, who was a 
staunch advocate of reform, and the lack of a named successor, has now left 
things somewhat uncertain.

The issues as they now stand are:

The existence of two separate Ministry-sponsored drafts, only one of which 
was subjected to a wide sector review process.
The need to use the product of a transparent, commenting process once it has 
been formulated.  
The fact that the fine-tuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a 
transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost 
in the MoP draft.  For example, the clear deregulation of price provisions in 
the tariff section have been removed so that there is, in the MoP draft, full 
regulation of price by the state commissions; however, in the state 
commission section, there is a provision that allows the State Commission to 
permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge 
(rather than the wheeling and supply price) for that class when it has so 
determined.   Thus, there is  an apparent conflict within the statute 
regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access 
to end users.  (There are many such examples.)

Action Item:  Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of 
Law for legal fine tuning (Basu mentioned that the "form" of the NCAER draft 
was not right), or repeat the iterative, transparent commenting process with 
regard to the MoP draft.  hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it 
reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests.  It is the first such 
document produced through an open process in India and was a process 
sponsored by the Ministry -- for that reason alone, the Ministry should 
promote and support the NCAER version.

Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by 
many parties in the sector.  Let us know how it goes.

Sincerely,  
Jane Wilson

Subject: Electricity Bill Developments


Dear Sanjay and Jane,

I wanted to again thank you for the briefings you provided during my recent 
visit to India.  Your analysis of developments in the electricity sector were 
very helpful.

As you know we are getting ready for the visit of the Prime Minister next 
week.  We have several energy events related to the visit and hope to be able 
to complete some of the "homework" that you assigned.  It would be 
particularly helpful if you could provide any updates on the status of the 
Electricity bill.  I understand that the Council of Ministers had approved it 
but I don't know if progress has been made in the Parliament.  Also there was 
a report that some aspects of the bill had been changed in the approval 
process.  Any updates would be useful for us in preparing for our meetings 
with Secretary Basu and the Prime Minister.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

You ought to take a look at this.  I completely agree with the approach, 
especially continuing to own the ball and ramping up the pressure.  The 
specific language is in the fourth paragraph.  (I know the "Indian English" 
is a bit stilted.)

Subject: Comments to MoP

Worked the Ministry of Power yesterday with Sanjay and had my own meeting 
with the Junior Secretary who is in charge of the Electricity Bill effort.  
He invited me back.  Found out from him that there are TWO drafts of the 
Electricity Bill -- the Ministry of Power began drafting its own draft around 
draft IV of the circulated draft and has picked and chosen from the 
circulated draft (that's interesting!)  The MoP draft is with the Cabinet 
soon to be introduced to Parliament.  The real law that is introduced to the 
Parliament will be released to the public once it leaves to Cabinet for the 
Parliament.  We will have a chance to lobby and explain to the Standing 
Committee out positions, i.e., the whole input process starts all over 
again.  Meanwhile, the three individuals with whom we met yesterday (various 
secretaries) requested our direct input again (there is obviously still time 
for the Ministry to revise its draft).  Thus, I've tried to rearticulate the 
critical elements that must be in the bill to constitute legitimate reform 
and point out how crazy the World Bank's emphasis on forming regulators and 
accounting unbundling is if unrelated to full reform in the note attached 
below.  

Actually made most of Amcham's presentation to the DOE mission in India.  The 
presentation that was handed out to them is attached below.  Once you've 
opened the presentation, go to slide show, custom, and see the slides from 
which I spoke (I took the substantive ones).  The important slide in both the 
custom show and the handout is the last one which is DOE Action items.  They 
told us that this was exactly the kind of briefing they needed.  Sanjay's 
happy, I'm happy, hope you're happy.


Please note that there are EOG slides included with regulatory concerns of 
the upstream E&P sector.  Of note is that I worked with Larry Morse of EOG 
and accompanied him to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoP&NG) on 
Saturday to directly give input into the Ministry Working Group on forming a 
regulator in the O&G sector.  Our scheduled 15 minutes (they were moving 
private parties through a New York musical tryout) turned into 30 minutes and 
a request for a written document.  I came up with a new idea of EOG to make 
their life easier and the Ministry was interested: the Director General of 
Hydrocarbons is the "regulatory agency" that is interfering in more than 
regulating the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs).  I suggested to Larry 
(who loved it) and the Ministry that the current functions of DGH be divided 
into three separate things: the normal regulatory function (permitting, 
environmental, safety and information management) that should devolve on DGH, 
a facilitator role assigned to the MoP&NG (provided in the law or regs 
somewhere -- this is essentially a government person to help private parties 
knock down barriers), and a Contract Adminsitrator, meaning a representative 
of the Government of India to sit on the joint venture's Management 
Committee.  I suggested perhaps a retired ONGC executive.  This may 
ameliorate the DGH's tendency to build a file and obstruct any spending 
whatsoever in the misguided belief that profits will be greater for GOI in 
the future.  I'd like to take this opportunity to record all our joint MoP&NG 
issues both upstream and LNG into one document.  Then it can become our joint 
platform paper to lobby from, do presentations from, etc.  Need to rest a 
day, however before that effort starts.

Cheers.  Hope to return to Mumbai tonight.  I've overstayed in Delhi by two 
days.  Sanjay mentioned that he now thinks that I will spend 50% of my time 
here.

interference of regulators in the business of Supply Companies and the 
unacceptable interference of the Central Government and State Legislatures in 
the freedom of transmission and supply enabling the diversion of supply to 
deficient regions.  Finally, there is a provision to cap supply prices in the 
event of extraordinary circumstances that is discussed.

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia will announce the names of international oil 
companies which have been awarded a role in the kingdom's three core gas 
ventures in the next two weeks, a Saudi official said in published remarks 
Thursday. 
The Arabic daily Al Watan quoted Abdulrahman Al-Sahibani, a member of the 
Saudi negotiating committee which has been consulting with IOCs on the 
projects, as saying that a Saudi ministerial committee had made its 
recommendations to the country's Supreme Petroleum Council about 10 days ago 
and that the SPC will now make the final selection.
Al-Sahibani said the ministerial committee didn't recommend some of the IOCs 
originally shortlisted to the SPC. He wouldn't elaborate. 
The 11 companies shortlisted last year for consideration are Royal 
Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CHV), 
TotalFinaElf (TOT), ENI SpA (E), Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum 
Corp. (OXY) who are bidding jointly, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Conoco 
Inc. (COCA) and Phillips Petroleum (P). 
The three ventures on offer have been estimated at a combined value of about 
$25 billion. 
Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to 
participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas 
enhancement.

Buying Illinova gave Dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy 
anywhere, anytime. 
When Chuck Watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading, he 
changed its name to Dynegy Inc. and took as its logo a tangram, a seven-piece 
puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways. Buying utility Illinova 
Corp. in February 2000, gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility. 
"The Illinova acquisition was probably the most well-timed and best conceived 
buy of the year," raves Jeremy Butler, an analyst at Value Line Publishing 
Inc.
ReportCard 
DYNEGY -- ILLINOVA 
Stock Price A 
Profitability B+ 
Strategy A- 
Braintrust B 
Culture B 
Competitive Position A 
Overall A- 
Why? Besides providing electricity to 650,000 customers in a 
15,000-square-mile area in Illinois, Decatur, Ill.-based Illinova also had 
recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gas-fired 
generating plants -- 3,800 megawatts in all -- to an unregulated subsidiary 
as part of the state's deregulation of its electricity industry. 
Thanks to soaring energy prices, as well as to $125 million to $165 million 
in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing Illinova's 
generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies, Dynegy is seeing 
the effects of the deal on its bottom line. "Illinova has been extremely 
accretive to earnings," said M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential 
Securities in Houston. 
Last year, in fact, Dynegy's revenues nearly doubled to $29.4 billion, while 
its net earnings almost tripled to $452 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, 
as a result of the $4 billion Illinova deal. In the first quarter, Dynegy's 
net earnings jumped 73%. 
Investors have been amply rewarded. Dynegy's stock took off last year, 
jumping 135% to $56.06 per share, making it the second best performing stock 
in the Standard & Poor's 500. Since the Illinova deal was announced June 14, 
1999, Dynegy's stock has skyrocketed an astounding 207%, from $18.25 to 
$56.11. (One of those happy investors is San Francisco-based oil and gas 
giant Chevron Corp., which owns about 27% of Dynegy.) 
For Watson, who formed Dynegy in the late 1990s out of Houston energy company 
NGS Corp., where he was CEO and chairman, the success of the Illinova deal 
underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants, anytime 
he wants, at any price he wants. That's why he dubbed the company Dynegy, a 
hybrid name taken by combining "dynamic" with "energy." 
If energy prices stay high and Dynegy's traders continue to make winning 
bets, analysts expect the company's net earnings per share to increase 
another 25% this year to $575 million, or $1.80 per share. But Dynegy hasn't 
been immune to the power crisis afflicting California, where it co-owns four 
power plants with NRG Energy Inc. of Minneapolis that generate 2,800 
megawatts of capacity. 
Indeed, since the crisis began, Dynegy's been defending itself against 
allegations that it's overcharging for power. 
The California situation has hurt Dynegy in other ways, too. On April 6, for 
example, its stock fell 5%, to $48.34, after utility Pacific Gas & Electric 
Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., filed for bankruptcy. (Dynegy provides power to 
the California market as a wholesaler but not to PG&E directly.) 
Dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering California 
utility, Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric, which claimed April 12 
that Dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it 
in 1999 -- but that it still operates -- because it doesn't think it will get 
paid. 
Dynegy denied the charge. "Dynegy did not instruct SDG&E to shut down 
generating units, nor did we suggest that we would not make power available 
to creditworthy buyers," Stephen W. Bergstrom, Dynegy's president and COO, 
wrote in a letter to SDG&E Chairman and CEO Stephen Baum. 
Dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the state's power woes. It's 
repeatedly pointed out to the press that its 50% stake in the four power 
plants in California only represents 1,400 of its total generating portfolio 
of 13,000 megawatts, or about 10.8%. Analysts, however, estimate Dynegy's 
exposure in California could give its earnings a haircut of as much as 15% 
this year. 
Even so, Dynegy's stock has recovered to a recent $56. "Illinova has created 
some volatility to Dynegy's stock because of the addition of power generation 
to its business," Prudential's Coale said. "But overall, it's been a great 
deal." 
While keeping most of Illinova management in place, Dynegy made the company's 
chairman, president and CEO, Charles Bayless, a nonexecutive director of the 
combined entity. Dynegy's also marketing and trading all of Illinova's 3,800 
megawatts of output. "They've streamlined power generation and traded around 
the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot," said 
John Olson, an analyst at Sanders Morris Harris in Houston. 
Illinova, meanwhile, solved a big investor-related problem for Dynegy. Before 
the merger, only 10% of Dynegy's shares were available to the public. As part 
of the deal, Watson convinced two of Dynegy's strategic partners, British Gas 
plc and Nova Chemicals, to sell their combined 50% stake for approximately 
$542 million in cash and 3,348,888 shares of a new convertible preferred 
stock. It also issued 3.3 million shares after the deal closed. 
Those moves increased Dynegy's float to more than 60% of the shares 
outstanding, which led money managers to flood in. The company's market 
capitalization has since tripled to $18.3 billion. 
Operationally, in its effort to focus on power generation, trading and 
marketing, Dynegy has been dumping some of its mid-stream assets, such as 
processing plants and pipelines, particularly in the mid-Continent region. 
The idea now is to increase Dynegy's so-called merchant power capacity -- or 
the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it -- to 70,000 
megawatts by 2004 through acquisitions, new construction and asset management 
agreements. 
As a result, Watson has become what some are calling "an acquisitions hound." 
He's already acquired some facilities. On Jan. 31, Dynegy completed the 
purchase of two power plants in the Hudson River Valley -- the 1,200-megawatt 
Roseton power plant in Newburgh, N.Y., and the 500-megawatt Danskammer plant 
nearby -- from various area utilities for $376 million. Banc of America 
Securities llc advised Dynegy on both purchases. 
Dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants, however. Witness the 
deal it announced Nov. 20 to acquire 1,330 megawatts worth of 
electricity-generating assets in Nevada from Reno-based Sierra Pacific 
Resources for $634 million. The deal got scotched April 18 when Nevada 
regulators -- spooked by its next-door neighbor's power crisis -- repealed 
the state's electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power 
plant sales in the state. (Dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added 
5 cents per share to 2001 earnings.) 
Still, since the Illinova merger, the total generating capacity built or 
acquired by Dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger. 
That includes 1,160 megawatts of new natural gas-fired generation facilities 
in Georgia, Kentucky and Louisiana that are expected to begin commercial 
operation by June -- just in time for summer. 
Like its cross-town rival, Enron Corp., Dynegy has also expanded via 
acquisitions into broadband telecommunications. (Dynegy also competes with 
Houston-based Reliant Energy and Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy.) 
Both Enron and Dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband, given that there 
are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to what's 
involved with natural gas or electricity. 
In August, Dynegy announced it was acquiring Aurora, Colo.-based Extant Inc., 
a privately held developer of telecom solutions, for $188 million in cash and 
stock. It completed the deal in September. Then in November, Dynegy announced 
it was acquiring privately held Iaxis Ltd., a London-based telecom that owned 
and operated an 8,750-mile fiber-optic network throughout Europe, for almost 
$200 million. Dynegy completed the deal in March. 
Dynegy is now developing a 20,000-mile fiber-optic cable network in the U.S. 
that it will link to Iaxis' network in Europe. It hopes its broadband unit, 
which lost $11.6 million in the first quarter, will be profitable by the 
second half of 2002. 
Still, Dynegy has differentiated itself as the "anti-Enron" because, among 
other things, it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them. (Enron, 
meanwhile, has been trying to dump its hard assets, such as Portland General 
Electric in Portland, Ore.) 
Enron CEO Jeff Skilling -- a polished former McKinsey & Co. consultant -- 
just wants to be a go-between, and not just in energy, but in broadband, pulp 
and paper and metals, while Dynegy's Watson -- a scrappy former commodities 
trader -- thinks he can play power generation and trading off each other. 
It'll be interesting to see who is right. 
Looking back at the Illinova deal Dynegy Inc.'s acquisition of Illinova Corp. 
has proven one of the best deals of the year.

World Bond Markets: Healthy Supply Boosts Activity In Eurobond Market --- 
General Motors Acceptance, International Finance Launch

LONDON -- Activity in the primary Eurobond market picked up early Wednesday 
amid a growing pipeline of supply, with a $500 million issue of five-year 
bonds by General Motors Acceptance Corp. and a $300 million 10-year issue by 
International Finance Corp. 
The market also was awaiting the landmark GBP 2 billion ($3.2 billion) 
equivalent asset-backed issue from Glas Cymru, due to launch via Royal Bank 
of Scotland and Schroder Salomon Smith Barney, dealers said.
The deal will fund Glas Cymru's acquisition of Welsh Water from WPD and was 
expected to come in slightly tighter than original talk for triple-A tranches 
of between 110 and 120 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage points, 
over U.K. government bonds. 
Elsewhere, Finance for Danish Industry, rated A1, was set to issue 600 
million euros ($535.7 million) of four-year bonds via Deutsche Bank, ABN Amro 
and BNP Paribas. Energy group Innogy PLC also was expected to tap the market 
again Wednesday with a 500-million-euro seven-year issue, expected at a 
spread of 110 basis points over midmarket swaps. 
Meanwhile, Finland has mandated ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank and Nordea to joint 
lead manage the issue of a syndicated government bond due 2007, ABN Amro 
said. According to market speculation, the size is around three billion 
euros. 
Energy group Enron has mandated Schroder Salomon Smith Barney as bookrunner 
for a multicurrency credit-linked notes trust transaction, consisting of 
tranches in intermediate maturities. Launch will follow a European roadshow, 
subject to market conditions, and UBS Warburg is joint lead manager. 
Secondary market activity was once again dominated by the telecommunications 
sector, where British Telecommunications bonds were between 10 and 15 basis 
points tighter on news that it will sell its stakes in Japan Telecom, the 
J-Phone Group and Airtel to Vodafone for GBP 4.8 billion in cash, reducing 
its debt burden by GBP 4.4 billion. 
"This is undoubtedly positive news for BT bond holders," HSBC said in a 
research note.




REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Power, Pricing and Politics

05/03/2001
The Asian Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

India's electricity shortage can't be solved without a new approach. 
India's power problem is back on the front burner because global generating 
giant Enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its Dhabol plant and 
walk away from a contract with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. In an 
effort to collect $48 million owed for electricity already supplied, the 
American company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a 
political force majeure, but without much success. So technically India is 
facing a sovereign default, after which Enron would spend years battling 
through the courts to get compensation for the $3 billion project. Of course 
everyone knows that's not going to happen. After more brinksmanship from both 
sides, in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a 
settlement.
Some of the problems with Enron are unique to that particular arrangement, 
but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with 
India's power problem, narrowly defined: a shortage of generating capacity. 
The country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about 6%, 
and even more during times of peak demand. In the early 1990s, the central 
government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private 
investors like Enron. 
But this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by 
the state governments -- they run it as a system of wealth redistribution 
rather than a business. California recently made the earth-shattering 
discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to 
disaster. But India's state electricity boards, or SEBs, proved that long 
ago; they have long been bankrupt, and often default on payments to private 
generators. As a result, most of the big names in power have now pulled out 
of India. 
Yes, the country does need to worry about generating capacity. It's estimated 
that in the next 12 years demand will more than double, with an additional 
100,000 megawatts needed, but only half of that is likely to be built. That 
could increase the shortfall during peak demand to 24%, a frightening 
prospect. But the first order of business is to reform distribution. 
There is a debate now about how to give state governments the right 
incentives to reform their SEBs. These owe almost $6 billion to central 
government-owned generators and mines, from whom they buy much of their power 
and coal. In the recently passed budget, New Delhi included a provision to 
forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either 
privatizing their SEBs or putting a floor on electricity prices. Electricity 
meters would actually be installed to measure power usage, but subsidies 
would still be allowed; many customers wouldn't pay enough to cover the true 
cost of that power. 
Still, this would be big progress by Indian standards if it happened. Many 
farmers currently get their power for free, and over 30% of power generated 
is stolen -- something the SEBs euphemistically call "transmission and 
distribution losses." As a result, the electricity boards average a return on 
investment of negative 18%. 
However, New Delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick. After a 
March 3 meeting between the prime minister and state leaders, Rajnath Singh, 
the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, said quite clearly that he wouldn't hike 
energy charges for farmers. The reason is obvious -- he faces elections next 
year, and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly 
takes away. Chief ministers will likely sign on to New Delhi's plan in order 
to get debt relief, but will backslide on implementation. 
The only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard 
budget constraint, which is the opposite of what the government is offering. 
One way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power 
generators and mines to the states. They would then have to figure out how to 
keep the system running. If they still chose not to charge for electricity, 
they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of 
their budgets. 
Another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes 
private power producers. Some states allow companies to have their own 
"captive" power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails. But 
these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent 
company. If larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were 
legalized, the states would come under greater pressure to reform. The 
private power suppliers could cherry-pick the best customers, those willing 
to pay for reliable power, leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders. 
This would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the country's power 
supply, since captive plants already have about 10,000 megawatts of unused 
capacity. 
New Delhi is still trying to reform the country's power market by fiat. This 
means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a 
shortage of electricity. Instead, the would-be reformers could let the power 
of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction.




INDIA: Foreign funds plough money into Indian shares.
By Anurag Sood

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

BOMBAY, May 3 (Reuters) - A stock market scandal, the high-flying software 
sector skidding to a slowdown, a faltering industrial growth and fears 
India's biggest foreign investor might pull out. 
These are some of the events that shook Indian investors, regulators and 
legislators in the first four months of 2001.
Yet foreign funds with deep pockets seem undeterred and have pumped money 
into emerging Asia's third biggest stock market by market capitalisation. 
Official data show foreign institutional investors were net buyers in Indian 
shares of $340 million in April, boosting the January-April tally to $1.98 
billion - exceeding the $1.53 billion in the whole of 2000. 
"There has been a higher allocation to Asia this year, part of which has 
found its way into India," said Singapore-based Samir Arora, head of Asian 
Emerging Markets at Alliance Capital. 
He said these were funds deserting the United States on fears of a slowdown 
and losses on Wall Street, but afraid to get into crisis-ridden Japan, and 
hence hunting for better returns in emerging Asia. 
According to Lipper Asia Ltd, a Reuters global funds data company, 
investments by the 20 biggest fund investors in Asia soared to $615.8 billion 
in the January-March period, up from $354.3 billion in the same quarter last 
year. 
But the country's stock market this year has been among the worst performers 
in the region. The Bombay benchmark index is down 10.92 percent since the 
start of January, only ahead of Indonesia. 
THE BUY LIST 
The shopping cart shows pickings this year have been widespread, from 
technology where fund managers say valuations were attractive after the 
meltdown, to the old industrial firms they feel could ride the wave of a 
turnaround. 
The Indian economy, number two in developing Asia by gross domestic product, 
is seen growing close by an average six percent - the IMF estimates 5.6 
percent, the Asian Development Bank 6.2 percent and the Indian central bank 
6.0-6.5 percent. 
Ajit Ranade, economist at ABN AMRO Bank, says India's large domestic economy, 
resilient to the global slowdown, could pull more funds into the country. 
But a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price 
manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors. 
"Weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk, but that does not rule 
out caution," said an India strategist at a foreign brokerage. 
Analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events 
such as the Enron controversy, where the U.S. energy giant is threatening to 
pull out of its $2.9 billion power project in the western Indian state of 
Maharashtra. 
Enron is India's single biggest foreign direct investor. 
They say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different 
from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments. 
The Indian government's decision to hike foreign funds' investment limit in 
Indian firms to 49 percent has also added to fresh buying in Indian software 
services firms. 
"India's technology sector is still the best in the region. It has got low 
capital expenditure, no inventory, and increasingly their customers are 
outside the technology sector, in areas like banking, insurance and other 
industrial sectors," Arora of Alliance Capital said.



India: Parties up the ante for probe into Enron deal
Mahesh Vijapurkar

Asia Intelligence Wire 

MUMBAI, MAY 2. All left-of-centre political parties, either partners in the 
coalition or supportive of the Democratic Front Government, today thrashed 
its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Enron
-sponsored Dabhol Power Company. The least- cost option was to initiate a 
judicial probe into the deal, which was replete with fraud, and seek the 
scrapping of the project, they said. 
This view was made public after the parties - Peasants and Workers Party, the 
CPI(M), the Janata Dal (Secular), the Samajwadi Party and others - met here 
and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of 
all parties, including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, on 
May 8. Its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the Chief Minister, Mr. 
Vilasrao Deshmukh, was away electioneering in the South.
These parties, worried about the huge, unpayable DPC bills, had been 
demanding a probe under the Inquiries Commissions Act but today upped the 
ante, saying "we are convinced of fraud" in the agreement with DPC. "The 
renegotiation," Mr. N. D. Patil, who leads the Left grouping and heads the 
all-party coordination panel said, "is not what we want... we don't want it 
at all." He and Mr. Prabhakar Sanzgiri, CPI(M), said "we no longer suspect 
it. We are convinced" of malfeasance. 
Along with Mr. Pradhyumna Kaul of the Anti-Enron Campaign, they told a press 
conference that the moment fraud was proved, the PPA could be annulled and 
"the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided." 
The demand was to scrap the 1,444 mw phase II, "take over" the 740 mw Phase I 
and initiate a probe. "The Godbole Committee (report) has provided enough 
grounds," though Phase I "was a reality and Phase II only an eventuality." 
Even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision, sought by the 
DPC, "on hold." 
The lobby pressing for scrapping the PPA said an FIR against the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board, under the provisions of Section 10 of the 
Electricity Supply Act, would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove 
that the entity or persons concerned had 'played games' at one time or the 
other. It cited bloated projections of energy demand in Maharashtra, provided 
by the MSEB to DPC, to justify the work on the Phase II which is now under 
stress following lenders' reluctance to provide funds till the issue is 
sorted out. 
When asked why Mr. Deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power 
tariff to a probe, Mr. Patil said "that is his view." For their part, the 
parties "would press for change at the meeting on May 8... We are not witch 
hunting. There have been fraudulent acts and we want them probed."

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, MAY 2. The Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao

refrain from committing the mistakes made by his State. 
Addressing a press conference here today, Mr. Deshmukh said the Maharashtra 
Government was treading carefully on the Enron issue and it hoped to 
renegotiate the power tariff with the U.S. company.
Mr. Deshmukh's observations assume significance in the context of the running 
controversy regarding the Kannur Power Project, which had been denied 
permission by the LDF Government. 
Mr. Deshmukh said that Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the 
Government of India made a formal request. He said the renegotiation would 
start as soon as the Union Government handed over the formal letter asking 
for a renegotiation. 
Mr. Deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in Enron's Dabhol project was 
related to the power tariff. The foreign exchange rate was fixed at Rs. 32 a 
dollar at the start of the project. But now, it had gone up to Rs. 47 a 
dollar, thereby pushing the cost of power up. He indicated that the 
renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well. 
The Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the 
Godbole Commission recommendation. He was confident that the Enron would 
agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the Maharashtra 
Government and its own interests. 
In reply to a question, Mr. Deshmukh said the Enron project had been a major 
drain on his State's finances, but it had overcome all problems by handling 
them very carefully. 
He said the Maharashtra Government would extend all support to the UDF if it 
were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the 
Kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as 
Maharashtra did. He, however, made it clear that his Government welcomed 
foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the State's interests. 
Mr. Deshmukh attacked the Centre for not using the various options available 
under the WTO agreement to come out with a balanced import-export policy. 
Asked for his comments on Mr. Sharad Pawar's statement that the NCP was 
considering joining the People's Front, Mr. Deshmukh made it very clear that 
his party's alliance with the NCP was confined to Maharashtra alone. 'The 
alliance with the NCP is a post- election affair as part of the attempts to 
unite all secular forces. The Congress had fought the NCP and several other 
parties which are now part of the Congress-led Government. But the alliance 
had been formed in order to keep the BJP-Shiv Sena combine out,' he said. 
Asked how his party could accept the NCP which had an alliance going with the 
BJP in Meghalaya, Mr. Deshmukh said the Congress- NCP ties were confined to 
Maharashtra. 'If the NCP creates any problems in Maharashtra, the alliance 
would end,' he said. 
Mr. Deshmukh attacked the CPI(M)-led LDF for its five- year misrule which had 
left the State virtually bankrupt. 'The credibility of the LDF is so low that 
the people would not vote for it.' The CPI(M)-led Left parties would be 
defeated in Kerala and West Bengal, he added.

India: Promoters holding parleys on future course of action

NEW DELHI, May 2. THE Shipping Corporation of India, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, 
Atlantic Commercial Inc (an Enron affiliate) are holding parleys at Houston, 
US, the headquarters of Enron Inc,to decide the future course of action on 
its LNG shipping deal for the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
The controversy surrounding the Enron-promoted DPC and the apprehension 
raised by the lenders to the LNG shipping project has made the three shipping 
promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company take stock of the situation.
"A final view on the LNG shipping deal will depend on what Enron decides on 
the power project per se and not just the second phase of the project which 
is being planned as a LNG- driven plant. Even the first phase is expected to 
switch-over to LNG in a couple of years", sources tracking the sequence of 
events told Business Line. 
The promoters have already paid 70 per cent of the vessel building cost to 
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Japan, where the 135,000-cubic metre capacity 
vessel is being constructed at a total cost of $ 224 million. 
According to the delivery schedule, the LNG vessel named Laxmi is expected to 
be completed and delivered by October end this year. 
A consortium of 11 global banks led by ANZ Investment Bank has taken a high 
exposure on the LNG shipping project. The Greenfield Shipping Company had 
struck a 10-year loan with the lenders worth $ 165 million at 325 basis 
points over libor. 
SCI has a 20 per cent equity stake in the project while Mitsui O.S.K.Lines 
hold 60 per cent and Atlantic Commercial Inc. 20 per cent. The LNG shipping 
deal for Dabhol was the first LNG shipping contract in the country involving 
an Indian shipping line. 
Greenfield Shipping Company had entered into a time- charter agreement with 
DPC to transport LNG from West Asia to its power plant in Maharashtra at a 
time-charter hire rate of $ 98,600 per day for 20 years. 
Unlike in the case of other ships, LNG ships do not have a secondary market 
since these are acquired against specific long-term contracts. 
In case of any eventuality, Greenfield Shipping Company would find it 
difficult to divert the vessel elsewhere as globally spot trade in LNG is 
almost nil. 
Fortunately for the Greenfield Shipping Company, the prices for new LNG 
buildings have started "firming up" after travelling through a downward trend 
till recently. 
Mitsui O.S.K.Lines-NYKK Line-KKK Line-SCI consortium which recently bagged 
the shipping contract from Petronet LNG Ltd also, has placed an order with 
Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard to construct two LNG tankers of 1,38,000 cubic metre 
capacity each at $ 185 million per vessel. 
This phase witnessed LNG building prices go down substantially, but has since 
started picking up.

MUMBAI, May 2. BANK of America plans to invest around $50 million (Rs 235 
crore) to expand its business in India in the next two years, according to Mr 
Viswavir Ahuja, who took over as Country Manager of the bank in India from 
May 1. 
"We have already obtained FIPB and RBI clearance and the first installment of 
$10.5 million will be brought in shortly," Mr Ahuja said.
The bank is setting up a 100 per cent subsidiary - Banc of America Securities 
Pvt Ltd - for undertaking primary dealership in Government securities and 
dealing in other debt products. 
In a chat with presspersons here on Wednesday, Mr Ahuja said in terms of 
strategy, "the bank intends to favour judicious balance sheet usage while 
increasing trading and distribution and advisory capabilities." 
Bank of America, which exited from retail banking a couple of years ago, is 
now focussing on the wholesale segment. It would open a new branch in 
Bangalore, the fifth in the country, in the third-quarter. 
The bank has an exposure in power, telecom and other segments of the 
infrastructure sector. Bank of America is among the foreign lenders to the 
Enron's Dhabol Power Project.

India: Renegotiation with Enron likely, says Deshmukh

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, May 2. THOUGH it continues to be a major embarrassment 
and a heavy draw on its finances, the Enron issue seems to have armed the 
Maharashtra Government with enough "expertise" to advise on similar projects 
elsewhere in the country. 
This was one of the upshots at the news conference by the Maharashtra Chief 
Minister, Mr Vilasrao Deshmukh, who is on an election campaign on behalf of 
the United Democratic Front (UDF), here on Wednesday.
In the course of his interaction with the newspersons, he said his Government 
would extend all support to UDF, if it came to power, to process the various 
parameters relating to the Kannur project so that it did not commit the same 
kind of mistakes such as Maharashtra. 
He, however, made it clear that his Government would welcome foreign direct 
investments, but not at the cost of the State's interests. 
Mr Deshmukh said the Maharashtra Government was hopeful of renegotiating the 
issue of tariff for the power from Dhabol project with Enron. 
He said Enron had written to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) 
that it was ready to renegotiate power tariff provided the Union Government 
made a formal request. 
The renegotiation would begin as soon as the Union Government handed over the 
formal letter in this regard, he added. 
The Chief Minister said the basic issue was related to the power tariff. 
The foreign exchange component was fixed at Rs 32 per dollar at the start of 
the project, which had now gone up to Rs 47 per dollar thereby pushing up the 
cost of power. He indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this 
aspect as well. 
He explained that the Maharashtra Government had proposed renegotiation on 
the basis of Godbole Commission recommendation. He was confident that Enron 
would agree to renegotiate the tariff in its own interest as well as that of 
the State Government.

Let Enron Exit
ADITYA CHATTERJEE & POOJA KOTHARI

05/03/2001
The Times of India 
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM) 
FOR years, Enron tried to woo Indian policy-makers, who couldn't seem to 
decide whether the Dabhol project was a good idea or not. Today, the boot is 
on the other foot, and it seems to be pinching. Enron's management is keen to 
stop investing in huge, capital-intensive plants around the world. In keeping 
with this strategy -and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management 
in India - Enron is mulling a pullout. But both the Centre and Maharashtra 
government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have 
entrusted this responsibility to the Madhav Godbole panel. 
Is Enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is? 
Financially, no. Indeed, if the only way to continue the project is on the 
present terms, then it makes better sense to simply scrap it. After all, it's 
better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further.
A little arithmetic will make this amply clear. If the Dabhol Power Company 
(DPC) does scrap its agreement with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, 
the Centre will have to cough up a sum of Rs 2,910 crore - a penalty amount 
of Rs 1,500 crore for one year's electricity bill, and $300 million as 
termination fees (which works out to Rs 1,410 crore at an assumed exchange 
rate of 47 rupees to one dollar). This is a one-time payment, and the figure 
of Rs 2,910 crore is corroborated by a recent statement by Union power 
secretary A K Basu. 
Now, if India were to continue with the present arrangement, it would end up 
paying at least Rs 1,500 crore per year for the next 10 years to DPC. On the 
other hand, what would happen if the project were scrapped? Well, very 
simplistically, India would save Rs 15,000 crore (Rs 1,500 crore multiplied 
by 10 years). But things aren't quite that simple, because that money could 
earn interest, while inflation would mean that Rs 15,000 crore after 10 years 
would not have the same value it would have today. To get around this 
problem, financial experts use a concept called net present value, which 
discounts future earning streams as well as inflation, to evaluate the 
attractiveness of a project. If we use a discount rate of 10 per cent, then 
the value of the amount India would save by scrapping the Dabhol project 
works out to Rs 9,217 crore, over three times the amount India would have to 
pay today if the agreement with DPC is terminated. 
Indian financial institutions (FIs) and banks which have lent money to DPC 
are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality. But how badly would 
they be hit? Well, FIs led by Industrial Development Bank of India have 
provided loans of $95 million and $333 million in two phases. This brings 
their total exposure to $428 million (Rs 2,012 crore at an exchange rate of 
47/$). Besides, State Bank of India also underwrote the maximum portion of a 
$557 million cross-border loan, and has an exposure of about $175 million (Rs 
823 crore). Thus, the cumulative exposure of Indian banks and FIs in DPC 
works out to around Rs 2,835 crore. 
However, since only 80 per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far, the 
net exposure of Indian lenders amounts to Rs 2,268 crore. Since the Indian 
lenders are not covered by any counter-guarantee, their bottomline would be 
hit if Enron backs out. The government, being a majority stakeholder in most 
of these institutions, would also be affected. But even if all these loans 
are taken into account and added to the one-time payment of Rs 2,910 crore, 
the total cost to the government would be Rs 5,178 crore - still lower than 
Rs 9,217 crore. 
Thus, the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than 
proceeding on the present terms. What will happen to the assets and the 
plant, did we hear you ask? Well, the government can sell it to private 
players and re-negotiate the cost factor with them - this time hopefully 
after doing a cost-benefit analysis! A sale of assets would also lessen the 
load on the government. Who knows, the government may actually manage to sell 
the ownership of DPC at a premium to another private sector player! 
Of course, fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us 
foreign direct investment since Enron is the biggest investor in India so 
far. After all, Brazil raised $31 billion and China $49 billion last year in 
comparison with India's measly $4 billion. But there's another way of looking 
at the problem - what does India really have to lose? In short, it's a case 
of losing what you don't even have in the first place. 
Many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power 
projects by multinationals have successfully re-negotiated their contracts 
with no serious financial consequences. Many nations simply did not have the 
money to pay for the inflated bills, some refused to pay even after losing 
international arbitration awards, while others like Costa Rica declared that 
the 15 contracts signed with independent power producers (like Enron) have no 
legal status or are bad in law. 
In July 1999, the Hungarian parliament declared that a PPA signed with 
multinational RWE was unconstitutional and void. In August 2000, the Croatian 
government tore up a PPA signed between Enron and a previous government. The 
contract was considered to be unaffordable, and was allegedly signed in 
suspicious circumstances. Enron subsequently abandoned the original 
agreement. In September 2000, the Philippines took a decision to not renew 
financially crippling contracts with IPPs. 
Controversy has accompanied the Dabhol project from the start. In August 
1994, the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of 
"the potential liability for a 1,000 megawatt plant was around Rs 3,000 crore 
per year". The department of economic affairs had also warned that the 
"...risk of counter-guarantees being invoked was not unreal, given that state 
electricity bills had been defaulting in payments". Caution was thrown to the 
winds then. The least India can do now is ask for a re-negotiation. But does 
the Indian government have the courage to go eyeball-to-eyeball with Enron 
and not blink first? 
* Scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a one-time payment of Rs 
2,910 crore 
* However, India would save over Rs 9,000 crore by doing so 
* There would be a net saving even after writing off FI loans to Dabhol Power 
Company



IDBI: whose life is it, anyway?
Tamal Bandyopadhyay

On April 30 a terse one-line announcement by the finance ministry gave the 
acting chairman and managing director of Industrial Development Bank of India 
(IDBI), S K Chakrabarti, a three-month extension. The government was generous 
enough not to keep the CMD as well as the institution waiting till late 
evening which it normally does for the fax message from North Block. 
But the acting IDBI chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if 
the government is able to identify his successor. He has been reappointed for 
a period of three months or till a regular CMD takes charge "whichever is 
earlier". Could there have been a better way to insult the country's largest 
financial institution (and its chief)?
First, the government planned to merge the Industrial Finance Corporation of 
India (IFCI) _which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of 
ballooning non-performing assets with IDBI to make them sink together. Unable 
to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by IDBI, 
the government now appears to be keen on leading the country's premier 
financial institution to its grave alone. This, not by giving an extension to 
the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and 
thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top. Nothing can move in an 
organisation when the CEO himself does not know how long he will survive. 
India's financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going 
short-term both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides. But for that 
transformation to take effect, they need leaders with a long-term tenure at 
the helm. 
To understand this, let's look at what's happening at ICICI, another 
financial institution in the country that is breathing down on IDBI's neck 
and threatening to overtake it. K V Kamath, CEO and managing director of 
ICICI, got a second five-year term seven days ahead of the expiry of his 
first term on March 30. Once his second term is complete, Kamath will have 
ended up running the show at ICICI for a decade. ICICI does not only give its 
chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the 
institution in due course. Kamath was groomed by his predecessor N Vaghul. In 
turn, he is now grooming Nachiket Mor to succeed him. 
Mor, a former senior general manager of ICICI, has recently been shifted to 
ICICI Bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking. He is 
likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present 
incumbent H N Sinor steps down next year. Eventually, he will take over the 
mantle from Kamath in 2006 by which time his stint at the bank will have 
given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury 
management and other skills. 
Given the circumstances, IDBI is fighting a losing battle. It will not be 
surprising if it goes the IFCI way with an uncertain leadership unable to 
steer a demoralised, overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy 
of the North Block. This is despite its tremendous brand value in project 
financing and widespread corporate relationships. 
Carved out of the Reserve Bank of India by an Act of Parliament in 1976, IDBI 
has business relations with virtually every corporate house in India. But 
that is not helping it tide over the crisis, because the key to any financial 
intermediary's success at this juncture is how it handles its resources _both 
currency as well as human. In an ideal situation, the cost of funds should be 
lower while the cost of human resources should be market-driven. In IDBI's 
case, it is the reverse: its cost of funds is on the higher side in the 
absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay 
market-driven salary to its employees. 
The net result? There has been an exodus of talent from IDBI and the 
institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted 
corporations to cut back on their borrowings. IDBI's sanctions and 
disbursements have been falling and non-performing assets increasing. It is 
sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by. 
Two former chiefs of IDBI S H Khan and G P Gupta spent a large chunk of their 
tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink IDBI's salary 
structure from that of the Reserve Bank of India, but without success. Small 
wonder that Chakrabarti, who became acting chairman on February 1 for a 
three-month term, has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime 
concern. He wants to address this on a war footing. The Centre has now 
successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term. 
Former finance minister Manmohan Singh accepted Khan's argument on 
market-driven package (he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees 
that was higher ICICI's) but could not do anything about it. P Chidambaram 
repeated Singh's failure on this front and Yashwant Sinha too thinks the 
proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the 
industry. For instance, RBI employees will immediately demand their pound of 
flesh. The finance ministry refuses to see the point that the country's 
central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete 
with ICICI. 
When three successive finance ministers failed to address IDBI's, problems, 
the institution went for soft options. It ended up appointing three 
consultants for restructuring in six years! First, Booz, Allen & Hamilton (in 
1997), followed by M B Athreya (in 1999) and finally Boston Consulting Group 
(2001). The third consultant, BCG, is yet to submit its report. 
While Booz, Allen & Hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and 
suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business 
opportunities, the Athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and 
the government's stake should come down without delay. 
Over the last few years, the institution has been planning its conversion 
into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as 
ICICI has been going full steam with new initiatives. ICICI Bank is also 
exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while IDBI Bank seems to be 
embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree. 
It's not that everything is great at ICICI. Over the past few years, the 
institution has lost some senior executives: I-Sec managing director Kishore 
Chaukar left to join the Tata group, ICICI senior general managers Anando 
Mukherji joined Enron and N J Subaiah took charge at Centurion Bank (which he 
subsequently left). The industry suspects the quality of ICICI's assets and 
is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth. 
Even the well-paid ICICI executive cadres find the pace of work is too much 
to handle and complain of fatigue. In private, they hate the mad rush for 
excellence. And yet there is a method in ICICI's madness. It has trimmed the 
flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes, branched out into 
consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art. 
The finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting 
the government's stake in IDBI to ICICI. Instead of pumping in Rs 300 crore 
as recapitalisation funds into IFCI it can simply let it die and sell its 
assets to other banks and financial institutions. IDBI's bulk and the brand 
name in project financing would combine well with ICICI's growing retail 
presence and unbridled aggression. The combination would be formidable enough 
to give the State Bank of India a run for its money. 
Of course, a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off 
like trimming the flab in IDBI and delinking it from the RBI pay structure et 
al. IDBI merging with ICICI may sound like an absurd dream but it is 
certainly a better option than merging IFCI with IDBI. If Reliance is willing 
to bid for state-run oil majors HPCL and BPCL, what's the harm in wooing 
ICICI to take over IDBI?


UK names coastal zones

For wind farm installations The UK's potential to exploit wind energy 
offshore has taken a step closer to reality. 
The Crown Estate has nominated 13 zones in UK coastal waters for wind farm 
installation, marrying 18 developers to nominated 10 sq km sites.
The 18 developers have pre-qualified to obtain lease of seabed agreements, 
with each of the sites having space to accommodate 30 The largest of the 
sites calls for the installation of 90 turbines at the Shell Flat, 7 km off 
Cleveleys (northwest England). 
This is in the hands of three developers: Shell WindEnergy Aegir; Elsam; and 
Celtpower. 
Other developers are: Solway Offshore and Offshore Energy Resources (at 
Solway Firth); Warwick Energy (Barrow); EnergieKontor UK Offshore 
(Southport); SeaScape Energy (Burbo); NWP Offshore (North Hoyle); Celtic 
Offshore Wind (Rhyl Flats); Hyder Industrial (Scarweather Sands); NEG Micon 
(Kentish Flats); Enron Wind Gunfleet (Gunfleet Sands); Powergen Renewables 
(Scroby Sands); Beaufort Consortium (Cromer); AMEC Offshore Wind Power 
(Lynn); Offshore Wind Power (Inner Dowsing); and Northern Offshore Wind 
(Teesside). 
By the end of July, Crown Estates will issue full lease arrangements. 
No more than three years later, the licensees must take up 20-year leases, 
committing to construction within two years. 
By 2006, offshore wind farming should be a reality in the UK. 
Should all the 18 projects go ahead, the combined energy output from the 
various sites could reach between 1,000 MW and 1,500 MW, depending on whether 
developers install 2 MW or 3 MW turbines. 
The existing standard is 2 MW but, by 2005, it is anticipated that 3 MW units 
will be practicable. 
The DTI has suggested that offshore wind energy will contribute 1.8% of total 
UK electricity by 2010, equivalent to 2,612 MW. 
While this may not be relative to non-the developments already mooted call 
for the installation of 540 turbines, and overall investment from the private 
sector of Pounds 1.6bn (Dollars 2.3bn), and the plans offer significant 
potential for UK-based turbine construction. 
For offshore use, the turbines feature a monopile steel foundation, driven 
into the seabed. 
The wind turbines, connected in daisy-chain fashion, are linked to land-based 
substations via conventional submarine cable, plugging into the national 
grid. 
Danish specialist Vestas Wind Systems is preparing its first major offshore 
wind farm site, the 80 turbine, 160 MW Horns Rev site off the coast of 
Denmark, in concert with utility Elsam. 
Vestas has also already turbines to Scroby Sands and Blyth, pilot UK projects 
using two turbines respectively off the coast of Great Yarmouth and Blyth. 
The supplier is now keen to develop a UK-based manufacturing site and has 
been in negotiations with the Scottish Executive over construction of its 
first UK-based turbine tower plant, at Machrihinish, the former US airbase, 
which remains in the hands of the MoD. 
NEG Micon, another Danish builder of offshore wind turbines, is also one of 
the developers in the UK, with a proposal to install 30 turbines at Kentish 
Flats. 
NEG Micon has installed offshore wind turbines at Yttrestengrad, Sweden, and 
is also participating in the Danish coastal programme. 
NEGhas already established a UK manufacturing presence, having bought out 
Aerolaminates in 1998 from Taylor Woodrow, and developed a riverside 
blade-building facility on the Isle of Wight, capable of building blades of 
up to 50 m in length. 
This size of blade will equip turbines to develop 3 MW of power, which the 
manufacturer expects to be in place by 2005.



UK: Emetra delays derivatives, to focus on physicals

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Metals Internet trading group EMETRA has postponed 
the development of its derivatives platform and will focus on building its 
physical business, company CEO Peter Sellars said on Thursday. 
"The world has changed in the past six months. It will be very tough to 
launch the derivatives project right now," Sellars said. "We are focusing on 
developing the physical platform and speeding that up a bit," he said.
EMETRA has secured fresh funding from its shareholders to continue developing 
the physical metals trading platform, Sellars said. 
EMETRA and Deutsche Boerse announced a letter of intent to develop a 
derivatives platform in June of last year; under the terms of the deal DB was 
to contribute the trading platform and take an equity stake in the 
derivatives project. 
The companies initially targeted January 2001 for the start-up of derivatives 
trading; this deadline was gradually pushed back, but as recently as Copper 
Club week in February EMETRA officials were indicating September of this year 
as a likely launch date. 
The company began trading on its physical platform last October at its 
website, www.emetra.com, with over a million tonnes of initial liquidity. 
EMETRA was founded in February 2000 as ajoint venture between London Metal 
Exchange ring dealer MG plc - subsequently bough by U.S. energy and power 
giant Enron Corp - Internet Capital Group and Safeguard International Fund.

Scottish Power Earnings Fall But US Strategy On Track
By Andrea Chipman
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones International News 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. multi-utility Scottish Power PLC (SPI) reported 
lower earnings for the 2000-2001 fiscal year Thursday but said it has 
resolved problems with its U.S. Pacificorp subsidiary and has streamlined its 
domestic business for further growth. 
Scottish Power said pretax profit before goodwill, amortization and 
exceptional items for the year ending March 31 fell to GBP628 million from 
GBP736 million a year ago, in line with overall analyst expectations. Sales 
rose to GBP6.35 billion from GBP4.12 billion a year ago.
The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 30.65 pence for the 
current fiscal year, down from 41.22 pence a year earlier, and said it will 
pay a total dividend of 26 pence a share after paying 24.8 pence a share a 
year earlier. 
Scottish Power said it has taken a number of steps to improve shareholder 
value, including restructuring into three divisions - a U.S. division to 
include its Pacificorp unit, and two U.K. sectors concentrating on generation 
and power supply, and infrastructure - to focus on energy growth and expand 
its activities overseas. Analysts reached before a meeting with the company 
said they were looking for more details on the company's growth strategy. 
The company said its Utah-based Hunter power plant is back on line feeding 
electricity into the local grid after a six-month outage that exposed the 
company to inflated western U.S. wholesale electricity prices and cost 
Scottish Power an estimated $160 million. 
"This year's financial results have been impacted by the outage at the Hunter 
power station in Utah at a time of exceptional volatility in the western U.S. 
power markets, and by the expected reductions in revenues resulting from the 
U.K. regulatory reviews" Chief Executive Ian Russell said. 
With Hunter back on track, Scottish Power is looking to grow the business of 
Pacificorp, Hunter's owner, and plans to add some 1,000 megawatts of new 
capacity by the end of the year, Russell said. 
He didn't rule out plans for further acquisitions in the U.S., but declined 
to confirm or deny reports earlier this week that the U.K. utility is 
considering bidding for Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Oregon-based subsidiary, Portland 
General. 
"Obviously Portland is in our own backyard," Russell said. "Frankly, we're 
still busy with Pacificorp and at the moment; that's what we're focusing on." 
Closer to home, competition in the wholesale generation and retail supply 
markets squeezed Scottish Power's profit margins, with generation operating 
profits at GBP93 million, down GBP14 million from the 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
The company's customer base remained flat at 3.5 million. 
Scottish Power is interested in further expansion in both generation and 
supply, Russell said. 
"Our strategy is very definitely to expand in the UK, both in generation and 
supply," Russell said. "We are very focused on expanding the value that we 
get from that integrated chain. At the moment, we are doing well on the 
organic side and would seek opportunities in acquisitive supply if we thought 
we could do so profitably." 
The company's regulated infrastructure business was also hit by strict 
revenue limits, cutting total operating profit in its power systems and water 
business to GBP545.5 million from GBP647.7 million a year earlier. The 
company's 90% debt levels are likely to increase pressure on Scottish Power 
to sell its Southern Water unit in order to fund its expansion strategy, 
Lehman Brothers analyst Gareth Lewis-Davies said. 
Speaking to journalists on a conference call Russell reiterated that the 
company is still considering all options for the water company, although he 
confirmed that Scottish Power had received "a number of offers" from 
potential buyers. 
"We have had a number of offers of interest, but we are weeks, or months, 
away from announcing anything," Russell said. "The underlying performance of 
Southern Water as a business has been very good." 
He declined to identify bidders or discuss prices offered. Italian energy 
company Enel SpA (ENI) is the only company to publicly declare its interest 
in Southern Water. 
The chief executive also insisted that his company is still committed to its 
telecoms unit Thus, in which it holds a 50.1% stake, despite the company's 
report Tuesday of a 2000 fiscal year loss before interest, taxation, 
depreciation and amortization of GBP21.4 million. 
"We're very supportive of Thus's strategy. I think the results show they have 
turned the corner," he said, noting that the unit demonstrated growth of more 
than 30% in its underlying business. "We are very happy with them."

Scottish Power CEO: Hunter Plant Fully On Line

05/03/2001
Dow Jones International News 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Scottish Power PLC's (SPI) Utah-based Hunter power plant 
is fully on line following a six-month outage, Chief Executive Ian Russell 
told a media conference call Thursday. 
"The plant started commissioning this last weekend, has been building up and 
is now producing electricity," Russell said. The plant is pumping electricity 
into its regional grid.
The plant, which belongs to Scottish Power's Portland, Oregon-based 
Pacificorp unit, went out of service in November after an electrical short in 
the laminate ends of the plant machinery started a fire. 
The outage exposed the U.K. utility to wholesale electricity prices inflated 
by the power crisis in the Western U.S. market, costing the company an 
average of $1 million a day. The total cost of the outage is around $160 
million, Russell said. 
He said the company is planning 1,000 megawatts of new capacity in the U.S. 
by the end of this year, a 10% increase in its U.S. capacity. The new 
capacity will include 100 MW of peaking plant from the Gadsby generator in 
Salt Lake City, which is already up and running, and 400 MW from its Klamath 
Falls plant in Oregon, which is scheduled to be on line by the end of the 
month. 
Russell declined to comment on reports earlier this week that Scottish Power 
is considering buying Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Oregon-based subisidiary, Portland 
General. 
"Obviously Portland is in our own backyard," Russell said. "Frankly, we're 
still busy with Pacificorp and at the moment that's what we're focusing on." 

Turning to Scottish Power's U.K. businesses, Russell said it had received "a 
number of offers" for its Southern Water unit but reiterated the company 
hasn't yet decided on a sale. 
"We have had a number of offers of interest, but we are weeks, or months, 
away from announcing anything," Russell said. "The underlying performance of 
Southern Water as a business has been very good." 
The company is continuing to look at all options for the unit, including 
refinancing it to draw out more value, he said. 
Italian energy company Enel SpA (ENI) is the only company to publicly confirm 
its interest in the water company, although Enel has declined to comment on 
the size of its bid. 
Less than two months after completing its acquisition of the 715 MW Rye House 
power station from Powergen PLC (PWG), Scottish Power is interested in 
further expansion in both generation and supply, Russell said. 
"Our strategy is very definitely to expand in the U.K., both in generation 
and supply," he said. "We are very focused on expanding the value that we get 
from that integrated chain. At the moment, we are doing well on the organic 
side and would seek opportunities in acquisitive supply if we thought we 
could do so profitably." 
Russell also emphasised his company is still committed to its telecom unit 
Thus PLC (U.THS), in which it holds a 50.1% stake, despite Thus' report 
Tuesday of a fiscal 2000 loss before interest, taxation, depreciation and 
amortization of GBP21.4 million. 
"We're very supportive of Thus' strategy. I think the results show they have 
turned the corner," he said, noting that the unit demonstrated growth of more 
than 30% in its underlying business. 
"We have no plans for doing anything other than be supportive," he said when 
asked if Scottish Power would consider selling Thus. "We are very happy with 
them."

UK: UPDATE 3-Scottish Power restructures as profits slip.

05/03/2001
Reuters English News Service 
(C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
(Recasts with exec comment on Thus, updates shares, adds fund manager 
comment) 
By Andrew Callus
LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Scottish Power Plc announced a restructuring on 
Thursday reflecting plans for expansion in the United States and a tighter 
power sector focus in its British home market. 
Britain's largest power utility was reporting a decline in pre-tax profits 
before exceptional items and goodwill for the year to March 2001 to 628 
million pounds ($892 million) from 736 million a year ago. 
But its shares rose 2.8 percent to 453-3/4 pence on some good news on costs 
and power generation in the United States, where plant breakdown and high 
prices have hit earnings and investor sentiment. 
Hunter, a power station in Utah, came back on line on Thursday after a 
160-day breakdown that cost $1 million a day and helped deliver 10-percent 
sector share-price underperformance over the period. New U.S. plants are also 
coming on stream. 
The profit figure was in line with analysts' forecasts, hit by UK regulation, 
the Hunter outage and high U.S. power prices. 
"They are keeping those costs down in the United States," said one sector 
analyst. "There were stories out there they were going to be worse than they 
have been saying, and it wasn't." 
The breakdown at Hunter, part of the UK group's 1999 PacifiCorp acquisition, 
was unusually costly because power had to be bought in to replace the 430 
megawatts (MW) of lost capacity while power prices in the region were very 
high. 
Even with Hunter back up, PacifiCorp has more customer demand than plant to 
supply it, so high wholesale prices will continue to be a problem. 
The new structure unveiled on Thursday consists of a U.S. division including 
PacifiCorp's regulated and unregulated businesses, a UK division covering 
generation and energy supply in Britain, and a third, infrastructure division 
which includes power systems and Southern Water in the UK, and create a link 
between U.S. and UK infrastructure businesses. 
NEW U.S. PLANT 
Chief Executive Ian Russell told reporters by telephone the Hunter power 
plant was now reconnected to the grid and would reach full operating capacity 
"within a few days". 
He was also upbeat about prospects for expanding generation in the United 
States, where Scottish Power aims to have new plants with an extra 1,000 MW, 
or 10 percent of current capacity, on stream this year. 
He announced that the first of these, a 100 MW plant at Gadsby in Salt Lake 
City, Utah, began producing on Thursday as well. Another, 400 MW, plant being 
built in Oregon "will be onstream in a month or so", Russell said. 
PORTLAND 
Scottish Power confirmed it was still looking at the possible sale or 
refinancing of its Southern Water business in Britain, and Russell said there 
had been "a number of expressions of interest" for the business, worth about 
1.8 billion pounds "but we are some way away from a conclusion". 
He also said he was still looking for a further U.S. acquisition, but would 
not confirm reports he was in talks with U.S. power trading group Enron Corp 
about buying its Portland, Oregon power arm. 
"When we acquired PacifiCorp we said it was a platform for further growth... 
obviously Portland is right in our own back yard," he said. "Frankly we're 
still very busy with PacifiCorp and for the time being that's what we are 
focused on." 
Investors have been concerned about the group's dealmaking plans given the 
weak market for UK water infrastructure assets and volatility in the U.S. 
market. "There is still a bit of deal risk there amidst worries they may sell 
Southern Water too cheaply," said one fund manager who is underweight in the 
stock. CEO Russell said the three-way restructuring would help the group 
"sharpen our focus on improving shareholder value" and "capture opportunities 
in the (U.S.) western power markets". 
PacifiCorp contributed operating profit of 351 million pounds, after the 
impact of the Hunter outage, compared to 152 million pounds four month 
contribution a year earlier. 
The group's 140 million pounds-a-year three-year UK cost saving plan was on 
track at the end of its first year, Russell said. 
Finance director David Nish expressed continuing support for Thus, its 
spun-off startup telecoms business in which it still holds just over 50 
percent. 
Thus is still lossmaking and has been struck by general investor disaffection 
with telecoms companies and concerns about how it would secure future 
funding. 
But Nish said Scottish Power had "no plans to do anything other than be 
supportive" of the company.

Distractions interfere with key growth questions
Financial Times, May 3, 2001
By Andrew Taylor in London



Cynics claim that Scottish Power's legal action launched this week, to 
rewrite a long term electricity supply contract, was more about distracting 
attention from the group's poor results than a realistic bid to cut costs. 
This judgment is a little harsh. Scottish Power would benefit considerably if 
it could renegotiate the deal that requires it to buy three-quarters of 
Scotland's nuclear output. The British Energy contract is worth o1bn 
($1.44bn) in the next four years. 
Shareholders could do with some distraction. Scottish Power, by its own 
admission, has had a tough year, which will be confirmed today when it 
publishes results for 2000. 
Ian Russell, who took over as chief executive in March, may even indulge in 
the new boy's practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news 
in the figures, making any subsequent improvement appear greater. 
His biggest problem will be to convince the City that he is capable of 
developing an effective strategy to change the group's direction, now it has 
abandoned plans to become a multi-utility. 
The group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a 
growing range of products to sell to its more than 5m customers. The 
investment required to develop national brands, win new customers and retain 
old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive UK retail sector, it 
says. 
Mr Russell, who as Scottish Power's former finance director was closely 
associated with the previous policy, has already withdrawn from joint 
ventures with Royal Bank of Scotland to provide financial services and with 
Thus to provide telecommunications. 
The group is also discussing the future of Southern Water, its south of 
England utility, which Enel, the Italian state-controlled energy group, is 
interested in buying. Cross-selling electricity and gas to Southern Water 
customers, let alone other products, has been disappointing, it admits. 
The group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the UK 
and US. But these also have their difficulties. 
Some of the biggest problems involve PacifiCorp, bought 18 months ago in a 
deal worth about o7bn, including debt. The price is looking more expensive, 
following big rises in US electricity wholesale prices. 
PacifiCorp has not been as badly affected as some US electricity groups. But 
it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in Utah that 
forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet 
customer demand. 
The failure of a 430MW generating unit at its Hunter power plant in November 
has cost the group $1m (o600m) a day since. One piece of good news for 
shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month. 
Another positive note is that PacifiCorp is negotiating higher retail prices 
with US state regulators to offset increased generation charges. It also has 
about 1,000MW of its own new power plant due to start production this year. 
In the UK, the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity 
and gas sales, particularly in the household market. It has also had to 
absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by Ofgem, the 
industry regulator. 
The shares, which fell 1p on Wednesday to 441-1/2p - have fallen by more than 
35 per cent against the FTSE All Share Index since December 1998 when the 
PacifiCorp offer was announced. 
So where does the group go from here? It made its reputation in the 1990s as 
a shrewd acquirer of UK utilities - Southern Water for o1.6bn and Manweb, the 
north-west of England electricity supplier, for o1.1bn. Effective cost 
cutting increased value, particularly at Manweb. 
The group was also one of the first electricity companies to string 
telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons. The sale of a 49.9 per 
cent stake in Thus, which operates the telecoms network, raised o1bn in 1999. 
Financing further UK and US acquisitions will be challenging. Thus shares 
have fallen from 844-1/2p a year ago to 61p on Wednesday night. Scottish 
Power has net debt of some o5bn with interest thinly covered three times by 
earnings before tax and interest. 
It has been talking with Enron about buying Portland General, its 
Oregon-based electricity utility. The group might need to sell Southern to 
cover the purchase price of about $3bn, including debt. 
Buying in the UK may be even harder. Scottish Power has been outbid recently 
for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental 
European utilities. 
What Scottish Power's shareholders will want to know is where growth will 
come from and how the group will pay for it. 







USA: UPDATE 2-Calpine, Kinder Morgan plan N.M.-Calif. natgas line.

05/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, May 2 (Reuters) - Calpine Corp. and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, 
L.P., said on Wednesday they plan to build a new natural gas pipeline from 
New Mexico's San Juan basin to California to help meet California's growing 
energy demand. 
The companies said the Sonoran line would be developed in two phases, with 
400 million cubic feet of gas a day (mmcfd) already contracted by Calpine for 
the first phase of the planned 1,160-mile line.
The first phase, slated for completion in the summer of 2003 pending 
regulatory approval, involves building a 36-inch diameter line from San Juan 
County, N.M., to Southern California with a transport capacity of 750 mmcfd 
to 1 billion cubic feet a day (bcfd). 
Phase two would extend the line to Northern California and could carry up to 
1.5 bcfd. 
Calpine has contracted for 500 mmcfd of gas for the second phase of the 
pipeline. 
An open season seeking a 20 year minimum commitment will be held this month 
for phase one of the pipeline, during which shippers will place bids for 
capacity on the line. No precise day was given for when this open season will 
begin. 
Another bidding process will take place for phase two, but no terms or exact 
dates were provided for the second open season. 
Calpine, based in San Jose, Calif., and Houston-based Kinder Morgan Energy 
Partners did not disclose how much the project would likely cost. 
In the past two months, several pipeline operators, including El Paso Corp. 
Enron Corp. unit Transwestern, Sempra Energy unit Southern California Gas 
Co., Williams Cos Inc.'s Kern River Transmission, PG&E Corp.'s National 
Energy Group, and Questar Corp. have announced plans to expand existing gas 
lines that feed California. 
California, fighting a severe power shortage that already triggered four days 
of blackouts this year, has over the past two years approved building 13 
major gas-fired power plants with a combined generating capacity of more than 
8,900 megawatts. 
Nine power plants totalling more than 6,000 megawatts are currently under 
construction.

PARDON ME WHILE I SCREAM IN THE DARK
Chris Coursey

05/02/2001
The Press Democrat Santa Rosa, CA 
CITY
B1
(Copyright 2001) 
I'm no economist, and I'm certainly not an expert on utilities. But I've got 
two eyes and a nose, and I can see that something stinks. 
I refer, of course, to California's energy market, or -- as the power 
generators call it -- "Who Wants to be a Multi-Billionaire?"
It's becoming clear that this game is fixed. Regis is giving all of the $100 
questions -- "What color is the sky?" -- to contestants like Enron and 
Reliant, PG&E and Southern California Edison. Meanwhile, we consumers are hit 
with "How many kwh did the BPA generate in the month of May 1973? Sorry, 
you're out of lifelines." 
How are consumers supposed to compete in this game? Even our legislators, who 
belong to the same party as Gov. Gray "The Negotiator" Davis, don't know 
what's going on. 
"It's like trying to play poker while everybody else is holding the cards," 
said Assemblywoman Pat Wiggins. 
But while we may not be holding the cards, we'll for sure be left holding the 
bag when this thing plays out. 
So who do we blame? State Sen. Wes Chesbro has an idea: "In the long term, 
the gougers need to be held accountable," he said in a Monday article. 
Ah, yes. The gougers. Those outrageous, out-of-state, dirty- dealing, 
price-fixing electricity-rate gougers who have driven PG&E right into 
bankruptcy and threaten to do the same to Southern California Edison. Let's 
get 'em. 
But hold on a minute. It turns out that some of those gougers that caused 
PG&E and Edison all that trouble are just PG&E and Edison wearing different 
hats. Both utilities produce power, and sell it on the same market as the 
"gougers." Then they buy it back. 
Also, out there with the Enrons and Reliant Energies of the world - - the 
other power generators that sell electricity to the utilities - - is a 
company called National Energy Group. It has 30 power plants in 10 states and 
controls a natural gas pipeline to Northern California. 
And it's owned by PG&E Corp., the parent company of PG&E Co. 
Try to keep up with me here. PG&E Co. is the company that has been so 
devastated by California's energy deregulation debacle. It's the company to 
which you are writing monthly checks that are beginning to resemble your 
mortgage payment. It is the company that for decades was guaranteed a profit 
by the rates set by the state's Public Utilities Commission. It is the 
company that said it lost billions before it declared bankruptcy last month. 
Poor PG&E Co. 
PG&E Corp., on the other hand, is squatting in tall cotton, as my daddy used 
to say. The Corp. received more than $4.1 billion from the Co. from 
1997-1999, according to a PUC audit. 
But the Corp. says it wouldn't be fair if it had to put any of that money 
back into the Co., its ailing subsidiary. It wants the people whose utility 
bills created that profit to pay higher bills now to bail out the Co., so the 
Corp. can avoid bankruptcy of its own. 
Who is being unfair? 
Meanwhile, Southern California Edison also has been shipping its profits -- 
also more than $4 billion at last report -- to its parent company while 
looking to the state for a bailout. 
Now Gov. Gray "The Generator" Davis wants the taxpayers of this state to pay 
$2.7 billion to Southern California Edison for that utility's transmission 
system. But as far as I can tell, Edison's rate payers already paid to build, 
maintain and operate that system with rates set by the PUC that guaranteed 
that company a profit. Now we're being asked to buy what those ratepayers 
built. 
I know that PG&E's and Edison's accountants and public relations people would 
argue that I'm all wrong here. And to tell the truth, when I try to follow 
the money through a maze of "stranded costs" and "contract power" and 
"uncollected power purchase costs" and "rate reduction bond credits" and the 
like, my eyes start to blur. 
But there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell, so I can tell you for sure 
this whole thing stinks. 
What can we do? Turn off the lights, and scream.

LNG carriage to be preserve of India-flag ships

05/02/2001
Lloyd's List International 
16
Copyright (C) 2001 LLoyds List; Source: World Reporter (TM) 
In an attempt to cash in on the liquefied natural gas revolution, India's 
shipping ministry is pushing through a proposal to restrict the 
transportation of the gas only to companies registered in India and vessels 
carrying the Indian flag. 
It would seem that the logic primarily is to ensure that Indian shipping does 
not get left behind in the LNG transportation race. Until now, the ministry 
has managed to get LNG ferried by energy companies on fob basis.
'We hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to Indian 
bottoms,' says shipping secretary Michael Pinto. 'We will do all we can to 
get approval from the committee of secretaries and the Cabinet.' Since some 
of the shipping contracts have already been finalised, this proposal would 
only be made applicable to future contracts. However, shipping experts are 
extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented. 
The leading Indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the 
expertise of carrying LNG, and would need the assistance of foreign companies 
to make the ventures a success. 
'A foreign LNG carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the 
Indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity, which would be 
quite a handful,' says Sudhir J Mulji, executive vice-chairman of Great 
Eastern Shipping Company and current president of the Indian National 
Shipowners' Association. 'The proposal really does not seem to be feasible.' 
For the moment, just two major contracts have been signed, both involving the 
state-owned Shipping Corporation of India (SCI). The first one involves SCI, 
American power major Enron and Mitsui of Japan, for the carriage of 2.5m 
tonnes of LNG per annum for Enron's 2,184 MW mega power project at Dabhol, 
near Ratnagiri in southern Maharashtra. 
SCI had entered into this memorandum of understanding with MOL (formerly 
Mitsui OSK Lines) and Atlantic Commercial Finance, which is an Enron 
affiliate. However, it is only a 20% partner in the consortium, with Enron 
holding a 60% stake and Mitsui OSK the balance 20%. 
The gas will be ferried by the LNG Lakshmi, brand-new 130,000 cu m capacity 
vessel being constructed in Japan at the Mitsui Shipyard. The contract is 
valid for 25 years from the date of starting. 
However, the consortium is registered in the Cayman Islands, which is a tax 
haven, and the LNG vessel will carry the flag of Malta. 
SCI has also secured the contract for carrying 5m tonnes per annum of LNG for 
the government-owned pipeline company Petronet LNG. The gas is to be ferried 
from RasGas of Qatar to the company's upcoming LNG terminal at Dahej, in 
Gujarat. 
A similar Petronet terminal, but half the size of Dahej, is coming up in 
Kochi, Kerala state. The transportation contract for this is to be decided 
later. 
Two other major Indian shipowners, who have taken a step towards LNG 
transportation are Great Eastern Shipping and Essar Shipping. The former has 
formed a consortium with Indian Oil Corporation and Exmar, while Essar has 
joined hands with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation (MISC) to form 
a 50:50 joint venture dedicated to gas transportation. 
The Dollars 2.3bn MISC, the national shipping line of Malaysia, is one of the 
world's leading owners and operators of LNG tankers. As a listed company on 
the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, MISC has the state-owned petroleum and oil 
giant Petronas (a Fortune 500 company) as its largest shareholder, with a 
stake of 62%. 
'Our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity 
share in the joint venture,' said Essar Shipping's chief executive, Sanjay 
Mehta. 
'However, at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of 
a third strategic partner, and continue to hold equal equity. 
'The final debt-equity ratio for the acquisition of the LNG vessels will be 
decided by the management of the joint venture.' Shipping secretary Mr Pinto 
feels that there are many opportunities for Indian companies, but is 
insistent that the tonnage be registered in India, so that ancillary business

'We will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned, since they

SCOTTISHPOWER REPORTEDLY TRYING TO PURCHASE PGE
GAIL KINSEY HILL of the Oregonian Staff

Portland Oregonian

Summary: Under such a deal, 70 percent of Oregon's electricity users would be 
served by one entity 
ScottishPower may be pursuing Enron Corp.'s Portland General Electric.
PGE's pending sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific Resources officially fell apart 
Thursday, and ScottishPower reportedly has held talks with Enron about buying 
PGE, Oregon's largest utility, for $3 billion. 
ScottishPower owns Portland-based PacifiCorp, bought in 1999 for $10.9 
billion, and has said it would like to increase its U.S. holdings. A purchase 
of PGE would bring together Oregon's largest investor-owned utilities and 
create a powerhouse entity serving more than 70 percent of state users. 
PacifiCorp also serves customers in Washington, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming and 
California, for total of 1.5 million residential and business customers. PGE 
serves 728,000 customers, primarily in the populous northern Willamette 
Valley. 
Speculation about the potential hookup with PGE surfaced during the weekend 
in Britain's Observer newspaper. In the article, an unidentified source 
described the merger as "an obvious one and, yes, there have been 
discussions." 
On Tuesday, officials from the various utilities and parent companies would 
neither confirm nor deny that talks, formal or informal, had taken place. 
"It's a vigorous 'no comment' on the rumors," said Mark Palmer, Houston-based 
Enron spokesman. 
"We don't comment on market speculation," said Rachel Sherrard, a spokeswoman 
for PacifiCorp. 
The speculation, whether of substance or whimsy, has drawn the attention of 
state regulators and consumer advocacy groups. 
"I think it would get a great deal of scrutiny, and I think there would be 
some serious concerns," said Ron Eachus, head of the Oregon Public Utility 
Commission. 
The PUC must approve utility mergers. The agency hasn't received any notice 
that talks are occurring, Eachus said. 
Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, said his 
organization, which represents customers of investor-owned utilities, likely 
would oppose a PGE-PacifiCorp merger. "We're not pleased" by the idea, he 
said. 
The Citizens' Utility Board has become increasingly critical of PacifiCorp's 
handling of the West's electricity crisis, which has forced the utility into 
the expensive wholesale power market. The board is fighting PacifiCorp's 
efforts to raise rates by 24 percent. 
In November 1999, Sierra Pacific announced plans to buy PGE for $3.1 billion. 
But the energy shortage slammed into Sierra Pacific's finances and spoiled 
the bid.



SCI ups profile with Petronet deal

With the Shipping Corporation of India taking a major stake in the Petronet 
LNG, India's maritime industries a high profile, SHIRISH NADKARNI ON the 
final Thursday of March, there was a celebration in NeDelhi, involving the 
four members of the consortium that had bagged the Dollars 400m liquefied 
natural gas transportation contract of Petronet LNG. 
'It is the Japanese custom to celebrate an event like this; and only the 
consortium members and their officials were invited to the function,' says KM 
Joseph, director, bulk carriers and tankers, with the Shipping Corporation of 
India (SCI), which has a 34.21% equity stake in the winning partnership.
The other members of the consortium are Japan's MOL (formerly Mitsui OSK 
Lines), NYK Line and K Line; and the contract involves ferrying 5m tonnes per 
annum of LNG from the Middle East to Petronet LNG's terminal at Dahej, in 
Gujarat. 
Two LNG carriers will be involved in the deal, each capable of carrying 
138,000 cu m of gas, and expected to cost Dollars 185m each. The vessels are 
to be constructed at Daewoo Shipbuilding Yard in South Korea. 
This was India's second major LNG transportation deal; and SCI, the public 
sector shipping monolith, which owns roughly half of the country's 
ocean-going fleet of 239 vessels, has a stake in both of them, as does MOL. 
'MOL is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to 
ours,' says the goatee-bearded Prabhat Kumar Srivastava, SCI's chairman and 
managing director. 'Our relationship is based on total transparency and 
trust; and we therefore feel comfortable with them. There may well be more 
such tie-ups in the future.' The earlier deal was also sealed with MOL, which 
has a 60% stake in a joint venture named Greenfield Shipping Company (GSC), 
with US energy major Enron holding the remaining 20% equity. 
The three members will have joint ownership of the 135,000 cu m LNG carrier, 
LNG Lakshmi, now under construction at the Mitsui Heavy Industries shipyard 
in Japan. When ready, the vessel will ferry 2.5m tpa of LNG from RasGas of 
Qatar to Enron's mega-power facility at Dabhol, near Ratnagiri in southern 
Maharashtra. 
However, to return to the Petronet deal. The MOL-SCI consortium won the 
coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of Dollars 68,900 per day, 
which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing 
consortia, MISC-Essar and Exmar-Great Eastern Shipping-Indian Oil 
Corporation. 'The Petronet LNG deal was the most prestigious and important 
LNG shipping project in the country, and we were very keen to secure it,' 
says Mr Srivastava. 
'So we told our Japanese partners to quote the best possible rates.' A 20% 
stake in the consortium formed with Enron may only be sufficient to net SCI a 
boardroom presence in GSC, but its 34.21% stake in the Petronet LNG shipping 
venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the 
latter company's board. 
There are other issues involved. 'If we had not emerged winners in Petronet's 
shipping deal, it would have done us a lot of harm for the other LNG shipping 
projects that are fast coming up in the country,' says Mr Srivastava. 
'We have already made tremendous headway in LNG shipping by being part of the 
Dabhol project, and we were very keen to maintain the momentum.' Experts rate 
SCI as one of the best managed public sector enterprises; and the bottom line 
of the company reinforces this feeling. 
For the first nine months of the financial year 2000-01, SCI had a sales 
turnover of Rs22.03bn (Dollars 474m), which was 16.2% better than the 
Rs18.96bn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year. 
The net profit zoomed from Rs766m during the period April to December 1999 to 
Rs2.32bn for the same nine months of 2000. 
While the results for the financial year ended March 31, 2001, are still 
being compiled, SCI officials place the sales turnover at around Rs29bn, and 
the net profit at just above the Rs3bn mark. 
While the company's tankers have produced spectacular results, even the 
loss-making liner division is expected to turn round the corner. 
'We have removed nearly 70% of the non-performing assets in the division, and 
the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year 2001-02,' says Sudhir S 
Rangnekar, director, liner shipping division. 
Recently, international consultants Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) carried out 
a SWOT analysis for SCI. 
They suggested a 'corporate transformation' of the company, apart from going 
ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier. 
The company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
ministry of shipping for the financial year 2001-02, whereby two new criteria 
will be used for judging the organisation's performance. 
'A new criterion, 'corporate transformation project implementation', has been 
introduced in the MoU, reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on 
enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations,' says Mr 
Rangnekar. 
'It also reflects our keenness to develop greater customer focus through 
process re-designing and improvement, and adoption of the latest IT systems 
and applications.' Another new criterion introduced in the MoU is 'annual 
operating earnings per employee', which is supposed Continued on page 15

CALIFORNIA GENERATORS REPORT RECORD PROFITS THAT DWARF FERC'S LATEST REFUND 
ORDERS

05/02/2001
Foster Electric Report 
3
(c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. 

About the same time that PG&E Corp. and Edison International announced 
combined write-offs of nearly $5.3 billion in unrecovered purchased power 
costs, four major California energy suppliers reported increases ranging from 
126 percent to 281 percent in first-quarter 2001 revenues. Meanwhile, FERC 
has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to 
justify $587,000 in overcharges during March 2001. 
PG&E and Southern California Edison Co.'s Write-Offs -- After a long delay, 
PG&E and Edison during the middle of April confirmed what many knew was 
coming --huge write-offs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the 
year 2000. Edison announced that it was writing off $2.5 billion in 
undercollected power costs for the year, leaving the company with a $1.9 
billion loss for the year. Edison chief John Bryson was hopeful, 
nevertheless, that a recent memorandum of understanding (MOU) his company 
signed with the state will allow Edison to recover some of those costs and 
help keep its Southern California Edison Co. (SoCal Edison) affiliate out of 
bankruptcy. "Prompt implementation of the MOU can avoid the large costs of a 
[SoCal Edison] bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its 
financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid," said Bryson 
in a statement accompanying Edison's financial results.
Whether Bryson's hope for quick implementation of the MOU will be realized is 
questionable. Gov. Gray Davis has been having a hard time finding the 
necessary legislative support for the proposal, and to date, has been unable 
even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the MOU. Instead, 
several state legislators are exploring alternatives, including having the 
state buy SoCal Edison's transmission assets as well as the whole utility and 
turn it into a state power agency. 
Edison's northern California neighbor, PG&E Corp., reported a strong growth 
in revenues for 2000 led by the strong performance of its energy trading 
unit, but that revenue growth was completely offset by the $4.5 billion in 
losses incurred by its now bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric Co. utility 
subsidiary. 
"While standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge 
against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs, taking this 
charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under 
law to recover these costs, nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in 
federal district court," said PG&E Corp. chief Robert Glynn. 
Generators' First-Quarter Revenue Reports -- In sharp contrast with PG&E's 
and Edison's financial performance, the parent companies of four of 
California's largest generators reported large jumps in first-quarter 2001 
revenues. Enron Corp. reported revenues of $50.1 billion, a whopping 281 
percent increase from a year earlier. The company owns only a small amount of 
wind generation in California, but sells power into the state through its 
Portland General Electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state. 
Enron's commodity sales and service unit showed a 207 percent increase in 
first-quarter earnings. 
Reliant Energy Inc. saw first-quarter earnings jump 215 percent to $13.3 
billion. The company's wholesale energy business unit produced $216 million 
in operating income for the first quarter, up sharply from the $22 million 
loss the company reported a year earlier. 
Reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial 165 percent jump in 
first-quarter revenues was Dynegy Inc. Of the company's $14.4 billion in 
revenues for the period, its marketing and trading subsidiary realized $100.3 
million in earnings, nearly double the $50.3 in earnings reported a year 
earlier. The parent company reported a 73 percent jump in first- quarter 
earnings over the previous year. 
Duke Energy Corp. announced a 126 percent boost in first-quarter revenues to 
$16.5 billion, led by a 324 percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy 
unit. 
FERC's Refund Order -- Similar to separate orders regarding January and 
February power sales in California, FERC on 4/16/01 issued a notice demanding 
that three generators justify $587,000 in combined power sales during March. 
FERC staff set a $300/MWh proxy clearing price for the month, and then 
applied it to the 14 hours of Stage 3 power alerts that were declared during 
March in California. The staff's proxy prices for January and February were 
$273/MWh and $430/MWh, respectively. The clearing prices' fluctuations can be 
attributed to changes in operating costs, including fuel and emissions 
credits. 
The latest refund order is the smallest of the three, asking for cost support 
for just $587,000 in transactions, while the previous two orders cited a 
combined $124.4 million in potential overcharges. The three wholesale sellers 
being questioned by the current refund order --Dynegy Power Marketing Inc.; 
Mirant California, Mirant Delta, and Mirant Portrero; and Williams Energy 
Services Corp. -- were named in the previous orders as well. 
Once again, Dynegy led the pack with the largest amount of potential refunds 
for March -- nearly $470,000. Combined with the previous two orders, the 
company is on the hook for more than $46 million in potential refunds. Mirant 
was asked by the latest order to justify close to $93,000 in March sales, and 
Williams $25,500 in March sales.

A few updates, clarifications and suggestions:
To be clear, the Group of Ministers has not approved any specific draft.  
They deliberated on various concepts, which approved concepts have been 
incorporated into the NCAER Draft VII.
It is our understanding that, just prior to his hospitalization, the late 
Minister instructed his Ministry to support the NCAER draft.
The Prime Minister has assumed the role of Minister of Power until a 
successor to Mr. Kumaramangalam has been appointed.  I'm sure you are aware 
of the dynamic role the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has played in the 
telecommunications reform in India.  The same kind of dynamic role should be 
played by the PMO in power reforms.
Mr. N.K. Singh is the Secretary to the Minister and was the person who 
actively worked on the telecommunication reforms.  If the Secretary of Energy 
has an opportunity to indicate to Mr. Singh (and certainly the Prime Minister 
if possible) the need for the Prime Minister's Office to become active in 
promoting power reforms and the advisability and need to support Draft VII of 
the Electricity Bill, it would be most helpful.

Subject: Electricity Bill Developments

Dear David,

I'm so glad you asked for an update!

We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill 
since your visit.  You will recall that in AMCHAM's briefing, it was 
positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been 
transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the 
restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets 
was attained.  Noone was 100 percent satisfied (probably the mark of a good, 
passable bill) but many  agreed to the draft and felt, while not perfect, it 
would achieve the desired reform.

We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill 
sponsored by the Ministry of Power.  The first has been developed by NCAER 
(NCAER draft) in a very transparent process with seven iterations and 
comments from 190 parties.  NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose 
by the Ministry of Power.  At the time of Draft III, a second draft (MoP 
draft) was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but 
not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process.  
It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been 
worked on by the Ministry of Law.

The draft, however, was never introduced in Parliament.  The industry 
discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to 
Minister Kumaramangalam's hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu 
heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or, at a minimum, allow a 
transparent commenting process on the MoP draft.  

Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft, and 
Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments.  (How widely it has been 
distributed is unknown.)  In addition, the death of the Minister, who was a 
staunch advocate of reform, and the lack of a named successor, has now left 
things somewhat uncertain.

The issues as they now stand are:

The existence of two separate Ministry-sponsored drafts, only one of which 
was subjected to a wide sector review process.
The need to use the product of a transparent, commenting process once it has 
been formulated.  
The fact that the fine-tuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a 
transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost 
in the MoP draft.  For example, the clear deregulation of price provisions in 
the tariff section have been removed so that there is, in the MoP draft, full 
regulation of price by the state commissions; however, in the state 
commission section, there is a provision that allows the State Commission to 
permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge 
(rather than the wheeling and supply price) for that class when it has so 
determined.   Thus, there is  an apparent conflict within the statute 
regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access 
to end users.  (There are many such examples.)

Action Item:  Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of 
Law for legal fine tuning (Basu mentioned that the "form" of the NCAER draft 
was not right), or repeat the iterative, transparent commenting process with 
regard to the MoP draft.  hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it 
reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests.  It is the first such 
document produced through an open process in India and was a process 
sponsored by the Ministry -- for that reason alone, the Ministry should 
promote and support the NCAER version.

Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by 
many parties in the sector.  Let us know how it goes.

Sincerely,  
Jane Wilson

Dear Sanjay and Jane,

I wanted to again thank you for the briefings you provided during my recent 
visit to India.  Your analysis of developments in the electricity sector were 
very helpful.

As you know we are getting ready for the visit of the Prime Minister next 
week.  We have several energy events related to the visit and hope to be able 
to complete some of the "homework" that you assigned.  It would be 
particularly helpful if you could provide any updates on the status of the 
Electricity bill.  I understand that the Council of Ministers had approved it 
but I don't know if progress has been made in the Parliament.  Also there was 
a report that some aspects of the bill had been changed in the approval 
process.  Any updates would be useful for us in preparing for our meetings 
with Secretary Basu and the Prime Minister.

Thanks for any help you can provide.

Steve,

Please forgive the delay.  I was having trouble with my PC again (we have a 
replacement in the works).  We are discretely investigating this group a bit 
more, but the general conclusion is that they may be a front for one of the 
opposition groups.  We are preparing counter arguments for the general 
public, but do not see much value in opening a dialogue with this "group."  
We always have had opposition and we can expect that socialists etc. (some 
groups have boasted that they will storm the DPC fences on March 1) will 
begin to rally using us as a scapegoat for Maharashtra's financial 
difficulties.  At present, we are getting balanced press and I fear that any 
explanation/outreach to the most vitriolic opposition will be used against 
us.  I am available to discuss this at your convenience.

As previously reviewed with Mark, Karen and Scott, it is very likely that DPC 
will invoke the Government of India Guarantee tomorrow (late night tonight 
our time).  Ken Lay was on the India call today and confirmed support for 
this approach, absent new developments.  The India team feels strongly, and 
we agree, that we should clearly set the explanation of this action by 
issuing a press release.  The press release would be issued by DPC for 
distribution in India only.  However, the story and the release are almost 
certain to be picked up by the international wires.

Attached for your approval is the proposed DPC release.  It is deliberately 
not worded in Enron fashion.  We believe there is a strong possibility that 
many Indian publications will take this release almost verbatim.  Since it is 
lengthy and explains the issue, we also believe many publications will 
necessarily reduce the amount of space normally dedicated to opposing 
commentary.   Of course, we will be armed with appropriate Q&As for use with 
international media.  Please let me know whether or not you have any concerns 
with this approach (713-646-6423 or cellular 281-948-7273).

This is brilliant Jane and team. I would like to build a database in DPC to 
keep this rate filing type info in. Can you in the meantime put in other 
columns of info such as number of consumers and the amount of billing for 
each group. This would give us another angle. Jane lets discuss with IT the 
set up of a database to house this and other info. Can you arrange with 
Sevina and Raghulan.

Subject: MSEB tariffs. The final Cost-of-Service model for 1999-2000

An additional complementary tariff study was developed by Amr Ibrahim and 
B.A.N. Sharma with assistance from Akshay Singh regarding the MSEB tariffs -- 
a traditional cost of service study.  This study is for 1999-2000 and 
allocates MSEB's revenue requirements to the various customer classes based 
on their cost of service.  In this case, you can see the difference between 
the allocated average cost and the actual average realisations from the 
tariffs as they are today, which gives you an idea of the basic tariff 
rationalisation that must occur to remove the unreasonable cross subsidies.  
(Note: because of the paucity of data from MSEB, the team used the same load 
factor assumptions used in the Andhra Pradesh cost of service study.)

Subject: Flash on MSEB

MSEB has placed their little engineer who was in charge of the Request for 
Rehearing/appeal/rate case on "extended leave."  He has been replaced by 
another.

We have been invited to the first Req. for Reh. team meeting tomorrow at 
MSEB.  This will have senior staff, the replacement for Mr. Bakshi, Little & 
Company (MSEB's outside counsel thank God.  Sanjay may have agreed to pay 
legal costs -- Wade and I discussed that possibility so we could get some 
legal assistance), Crisil (the consultant) and DPC (us).  This is a real 
breakthrough.  

Wade was quite pleased when I reported this and credits both Sanjay's 
communication with the Chairman (attached below is the letter drafted by me, 
with the fourth point on legal assistance drafted by Wade) as well as having 
the GRA expertise right here in Mumbai, my having given a presentation to the 
Chairman.  

Anyway, effectiveness of the effort remains to be seen; however, we at least 
are on the team.  Step 1 accomplished (only took three weeks!)

I'm pleased that Amr is here.  He has helped me communicate (by a formula) my 
concerns on power purchase costs being included in the rates, has figured out 
a billing unit theory to get it increased  which will increase the average 
rate which will increase MSEB revenues.

It is my understanding that Jim Hughes will be talking with Ken Lay and Stan Horton today about issuing the transfer notice, which starts the valuation process for the Dabhol Power Company (DPC).  Depending upon their decision, the transfer notice may be sent as early as Saturday, but could be delayed for up to a month.  To prevent MSEB from trying to give this a negative spin, we intend to use the attached statement with the key India press.  At this point we do not plan to aggressively promote the story through a press release.  Any comments would be appreciated.

As indicated in my message earlier today, we have sent notice to the 
government of Maharashtra drawing on the state guarantee to cover the 
remaining past due bill for November (there is an additional 7 day wait 
before we can take action on the December bill).  The amount involved is 89 
crore (approximately $19 million).  We definitely expect press 
interest/coverage, The Standard in Delhi evidently has the story, but the 
wires have not picked up on it yet.  Attached are the statement and Q&As that 
will be used to respond to any inquiries.

For those of us who missed the program, foll is a gist: 



Channel??????????????CNBC, Asia
Programme????????India  Market Wrap
Subject???????????????LNG  industry in India
Duration?????????????5  minutes
Date??????????????????  14/ 07/ 2000
Journalist?????????  Ms. Jaya Mahajan 
Visuals: aerial view of Dabhol, shots of  terminal under construction 
?
Introduction: Natural gas is emerging as an  important alternative fuel for 
power and fertiliser plants in India. The Indian  government is encouraging 
import of natural gas to cope with?growing  depletion of India's natural gas 
reserves.
13 LNG terminals are being planned in India?- an  estimated investment of Rs. 
300 billion. But, the demand for LNG depends on  gas-based power projects, 
growth of which has been sluggish.
?
The future of LNG in India
13 terminals are currently being planned that can transport 40  million 
tonnes of LNG per year. Half of these projects are in Maharashtra and  
Gujarat where five terminals will come up in the next ten years.
Petronet - Dahej
Shell????? - Hazira
Indigas? - Mumbai
Enron?? - Dabhol
British Gas - Pipavav
Of all proposed LNG terminals, it is only at Dabhol that  construction of?the 
2 million tonne LNG terminal has started. ?The  first ship is expected in 
November, 2001 and gas deliveries?to customers in  Mumbai are expected?to 
start?by mid-2002. Enron  will enjoy the first mover advantage, where 
construction of LNG terminal is half  complete.
Enron's?main competitor will be Indigas promoted by TEC,  Total and Gail 
which is expected to come up by 2004. The basic engineering  design is ready 
and contracts for storage tanks, jetty and terminal will soon be  decided.
?
C de Frassinette, MD, Indigas:
Infrastructure is required for LNG terminals - we will benefit  as?Gail's 
infrastructure is in place.?In the next ten years, when  phase II is?on line, 
we will be able to market?our fuel (about 6  million tonnes) thanks to the 
development of the natural gas market and  depletion of Bombay High. 
?
K. Wade Cline, COO Enron India
Due to our contractual access to the existing LNG facility at  Dabhol, we 
will be able to share in this and therefore don't have to incur extra  costs 
on LNG tanks, regas facility and fuel landing jetty.
All projects need a pipeline to be built from?location to  customers - our is 
only 190 km North of Dabhol to Mumbai?and will service  our customers in the 
Mumbai route. We don't see any disadvantage.
?
Voice-over:
The success of these projects depends on the cost of  construction?and price 
of gas. Only Petronet (a consortium of Indian oil  companies) which expects 
to begin supplying gas by 2003 has fixed a price -  $4.5, per billion tonne 
unit. This is 20% cheaper than naphtha, the other major  fuel currently being 
used. The price of LNG is?determined by customs duty  which, in India, is at 
over 20%?- the highest anywhere in the  world.
?
K. Wade Cline
We'd like the government to lower duty on LNG?and make it  closer to, for 
example, rates on other infrastructure projects like power  plants. ?? 
?
C de Frassinette
In Japan, LNG is not taxed at all. In Korea, there is just 1%  customs duty. 
Japan is the largest importer of LNG, accounting for?60%  of? global LNG 
market. We need to move in this direction.
?
Voice-over:
Even if LNG were affordable, setting imported terminals is an  expensive 
exercise. Estimated cost of the?5 million tonne Petronet terminal  is Rs. 
22.5 billion. The project cost of Indigas is Rs.25 billion.
Not all terminals will finally come up, but for those that do,  there is 
enough demand for this fuel of the future that is cleaner and greener  than 
others. 
?

We have had a flurry of media inquiries in India and a number in the US as well.  We see this as an opportunity to get across our key, related messages.
