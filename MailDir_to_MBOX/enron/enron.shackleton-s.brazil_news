BRAZIL: MEETING OF MAE ON FEBRUARY 29TH
Gazeta Mercantil, 29 Feb 2000, p. A-15:-
 Companies which are part of the MAE (Electricity Wholesale Market) will hold 
a general meeting on February 29th 2000 with the intention to discuss the new 
rules for the operations of the sector.
The companies will discuss, for example, one resolution taken on February 
25th which concedes credits for the companies and other which increases the 
number of available plants to operate in peak periods.


BRAZIL: RURAL ELECTRIFICATION IN RIO DE JANEIRO
Gazeta Mercantil, 29 Feb 2000, p. a-13:-
 According to the president of the Brazilian electricity company Cerj, 
Alejandro Danus, the company has already informed the Brazilian Ministry of 
Mining and Energy that it will join the rural electrification program 'Luz no 
Campo' of the ministry, expecting to sign the contract in 15 days.
The two other electricity concessionaires which operate in the state of Rio 
de Janeiro had already agreed to join the program, but Cerj took longer to 
reach the same decision because it was analysing which technology should be 
used in its concession area. Cerj is expected to invest R$ 60mn in the area, 
mainly in the north of the state, benefiting 30,000 families which still do 
not have access to electricity.


BRAZIL ANGRA-2 TO START OPERATIONS 
Folha de S.Paulo, 27 Feb 2000, p. 1-14:-
 The Brazilian National Nuclear Energy Commission (Cnen) established the 
deadline of March 15th 2000 to release an authorisation for the operation of 
the nuclear power station Angra 2 of the Brazilian state-owned nuclear 
electricity company Eletronuclear in the Brazilian city of Angra dos Reis 
(state of Rio de Janeiro).
With the authorisation, Angra 2 can begin to charge its reactor, testing and 
inspecting safety after that. If everything is successful, the power station 
ill begin to generate electricity in the end of April 2000 and generating 
1,245 MW 3 months after that. But this time may be much longer, considering 
that the previous nuclear power station Angra 1 took more than 3 years to 
operate commercially after the charging. 


BRAZIL: ELETROSUL IN POWER TRANSMISSION LINE
Gazeta Mercantil, 29 Feb 2000, p. a-13:-
 Groups which want to compete in the tender for the construction of a power 
transmission line between the Brazilian cities of Campos Novos and Blumenau 
(state of Santa Catarina) must be qualified until March 15th 2000.
The company Eletrosul, a subsidiary of the Brazilian state-owned electricity 
company Eletrobras, will compete in the tender alone (not participating in 
any consortium).
Eletrosul signed pre-contracts with the companies ABB (Asea Brown Boveri) and 
Siemens which will conduct works and supply equipment (Eletrosul will operate 
the lines).


ARGENTINA: IMPACT OF POWERGEN'S ACQUISITION
El Cronista Comercial, 29 Feb 2000, p. 15:-
 With the acquisition of US-based LG&E Energy for US$ 5.4bn, UK-based

companies Gas Natural BAN, Distribuidora de Gas del Centro and Cuyana. LG&E 
has 1mn clients in Kentucky, Virginia, Spain and Argentina. 


BRAZIL: FREE IMPORT OF FUEL POSTPONEMENT
O Estado de S.Paulo, 26 Feb 2000, p. b-1:-
 The Brazilian executive-secretary of the Ministry of Treasury, Amaury Bier, 
declared on February 25th 2000 that the Brazilian market of oil and 
derivatives will be opened only in January 2001, and not in August 2000, as 
predicted in the Oil Law.
The federal government will propose the change of this date to the Congress 
through a draft law.
The reason for this measure, according to Bier, is that the oil sector is 
currently too confused. He also informed that the government did not create a 
substitute for the Specific Price Parcel (PPE) yet. The PPE is the part of 
the fuel price which maintains the oil account.


BRAZIL: INCREASE OF FUELS PRICES
O Estado de S.Paulo, 26 Feb 2000, p. B-1:-
 The executive-secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Treasury, Amaury Bier,

prices increased on March 1st 2000:
- gasoline and diesel oil by 7% in the refineries and
- kerosene for aircraft by 23%. 
According to government estimations, this increase of gasoline prices in 
refineries will result in an increase by 5% in gas stations, for final 
consumers. The increase of the kerosene will result in an increase by 3% in 
flights tickets prices.


BRAZIL: OIL SPILLAGE IN PARA
Folha de S.Paulo, 29 Feb 2000, p. 3-8:-

in the river.


ARGENTINA: LOWERING TAXES, IMPOSSIBLE FOR NOW
El Cronista Comercial, 29 Feb 2000, p.2:-
 Officials at the Argentine Revenue Service warn that it would be impossible 
to lower taxes for now. Many are requesting that fuel and value added taxes 
be lowered but this would mean US$ 2bn less in government revenues. When 
considering the government fiscal deficit, it is easy to understand why the 
government must look toward solutions that would increase tax collection and 
not reduce it.


ECUADOR: EDC PLANS TO EXPLOIT GAS
El Comercio (Ecuador), 29 Feb 2000, p. 1:-
 The firm, Energy Development Corporation (EDC) announced that it will invest 
some US$ 100mn in a project to exploit natural gas in the coastal zone of

Cinco Dias, 29 Feb 2000, p.5:-
 Spanish oil operator Respsol YPF, which has broken its agreement with 
Spanish electricity operator Iberdrola, intends to operate in the electricity 
market in countries where it is active in gas business, particularly 
Argentina, Brazil and Spain.
On the other hand, negotiations between Repsol YPF and Italian oil operator 
ENI (Ente Nazionale d'Idrocarburi) are taking place.  In any case, eventual 
agreements will be implemented when ENI's privatisation process will conclude.

BOLIVIA: CHACO SEEKS NEW CLIENTS
Los Tiempos (Bolivia), 29 Feb 2000, p. on line:-
 Bolivia's oil and gas firm Chaco announced it is concentrating its efforts 
on gaining new clients for the gas it plans to trade from Bolivia to Brazil. 
The firm will place in Brazil 30mn cubic metres of gas per day during a 
20-year term, according to the contract it signed with the Brazilian 
government. Early in 1999, Chaco was negotiating a contract with Pan American 
Energy which failed due to the opposition of YPF, the Argentine oil company.


BOLIVIA/BRAZIL: COMPANIES TO TRADE GAS 
El Diario (Bolivia), 29 Feb 2000, p. on line:-

 With gasoline prices skyrocketing all over the world, alternative fuels have 
been put back on the agenda, and many Argentines are looking to compressed 
natural gas as a solution to reduce fuel consumption and costs. The number of 
converted vehicles in the country has grown 9 times since 1994, reaching over 
489,000 vehicles in 1999. Argentina is the country with the most natural gas 
powered cars in the world where it is estimated that over 1.3mn gas powered 
cars exist. Over 3000 vehicles per month are converted to natural gas and 
over 800 service stations in 144 cities offer it in Argentina. Of the 489,000 
units, 71.2% are used by private citizens and 10% by taxis. Natural gas 
engines are environmentally friendly and wear out engines less than regular 
gasoline. The savings in fuel consumption can be as high as 70% compared to 
gasoline, making the engine conversion investment amortizable in only 9 
months or 25,000 km. Car maker, Fiat is the only company to produce natural 
gas models in Argentina direct from th

estimate for the oil account result in 2000 is being calculated again.
According to the Budget Commission of the Brazilian Congress, the federal 
government will have only R$ 1.5bn from the oil account in 2000, based on the 
following scenario: oil price between US$ 23 and US$ 25/barrel, dollar rate 
of R$ 1.85 and no price readjustment for consumers. 


ARGENTINA: DIESEL FUEL PRICE RISE DENOUNCED
Buenos Aires Economico, 24 Feb 2000, p. 2:-
 The four associations representing road passenger transport companies in 
Argentina have announced that they will present formal complaints against oil 
companies for the recent rises in diesel prices, totalling 61% since July 
1999 in comparison with a 37% rise in world oil prices. The companies plan to 
present complaints both to the courts and to the National Competition Defence 
Commission over the increase, which has resulted in an additional cost of US$ 
150mn to passenger transport companies.
The sector has also announced that bus services between the hours of 23.00 
and 4.00 will soon be cut off, due to the crisis affecting the sector, while 
daytime services will be reduced up to 10%. These measures will result in the 
loss of up to 5,000 jobs, according to sector chamber CETAP. 
The urban passenger transport sector is now also faced with losses of some 
US$ 400mn annually due to competition from illegal mini-cab companies, as 
well as unpaid debts of some US$ 800mn arising from the liquidation of former 
state reinsurance company INDER. A 1997 decree which suspended lawsuits for 
accidents as a result of the emergency faced by the sector will expire on 31 
March, and companies fear a wave of lawsuits thereafter.

BRAZIL: CONCLUSION OF MAE RULES
Gazeta Mercantil, 01 Mar 2000, p. a-14:-
 On February 29th 2000, last outstanding matters on the rules for beginning=
=20
of operations of the Brazilian Electricity Wholesale Market (MAE) were=20
decided and approved.
Thus, first reference date for the MAE to begin operating was set for=20
September 1st 2000.
Rules had been defined into seven groups: prices formation, measurement=20
standardisation, thermal generation, energy reallocation, international=20
interchange, payment of the system's service burdens and penalties.
These first six groups will be produced within the next 10 days for approva=
l=20
by the Brazilian National Regulatory Agency for Electricity (Aneel), while=
=20
the penalties group still remains an outstanding matter to be defined and=
=20
approved before September 1st 2000.
One outstanding matter that was hindering the definition of MAE's beginning=
=20
date was conflicts between electricity distribution and generation companie=
s=20
on the way to negotiate the so-called exceding energy, which is the=20
difference between energy initially provided in supply contracts and that=
=20
actually consumed on the market.
The answer is the creation of energy "credits" whenever consumption is high=
er=20
than hired contract. Exceding energy will be converted into credits that ca=
n=20
be both exercised afterwards or traded on the market. Payment of distributi=
on=20
to generation companies have been maintained as provided in contracts.
This credit system will be in effect from September 1st 2000 to December 31=
st=20
2002. After that, remaining credits not used will be liquidated through the=
=20
optimisation tariffs that currently is about R$ 3/MWh.

ve=20
a positive impact over the incomes received by the province of Mendoza,=20
Argentina, in concept of royalties, according to estimations made by this=

province's government. However, Gustavo Callejas, former Secretary of Fuels=

ARGENTINA: FRAUD MANOEUVRE DENOUNCED
La Nacion (Argentina), 04 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 A new scandal involves the Argentine tax bureau AFIP. One of its officials=

=20
US$ 330mn fraud due to falsified accounts they presented during the terms=
=20
1995, 1996 and 1997. Through a "ghost" firm, Kiball purchased fuels without=

paying the gasoline transfer tax (ITC) and falsified the payment=20
certification the AFIP grants, and even adulterated the gasoline with a mix=

of different fuels.


ARGENTINA: WIND NOT SO FREE ANYMORE IN CHUBUT
Clarin, 08 Mar 2000, p.20:-
 Legislators from the Argentine province of Chubut are drafting a bill that=

ARGENTINA: GAS DISTRIBUTORS PROTEST COMPETITION
La Nacion (Argentina), 09 Mar 2000, p. 2/1:-
 The Argentine gas distributors association Adigas has complained that plan=
s=20
by regulatory body Enargas to allow large consumers direct access to the=20
wholesale gas market through brokers will favour new actors in the market a=
nd=20
reduce their income. Adigas claimed that its members have respected the rig=
ht=20
to access to gas transport and distribution capacity, and that the entry of=
=20
new players under more favourable conditions would make it impossible for=
=20
them to compete on an equal footing.


ARGENTINA: DEBATE OVER ACCESS TO GAS MARKET
El Cronista Comercial, 07 Mar 2000, p.3:-
 The Argentine National Gas Regulator (Enargas) will hold public hearings o=
n=20
7 March to determine whether to change or modify the current natural gas=20
commercialising and distribution system. Natural gas retailers want to be=
=20
able to compete with gas distributors, but are unable to because of the=20
current fixed rate system. Distributors believe that changing the current=
=20
system would violate concession agreements and these companies are=20
threatening to international measures to enforce the agreements. Distributo=
rs=20
also say that retailer have made no infrastructure investment in Argentina=
=20
and a change in the regulation scheme would create a disincentive for=20
investment in Argentina. Enargas is also considering the possibility of=20
allowing more small and medium sized business access to the wholesale natur=
al=20
gas market.


ARGENTINA: GOV'T WANTS TO LOWER GAS RATES
Buenos Aires Economico, 06 Mar 2000, p.2:-
 After negotiating a slight drop in telephone and electricity rates, the=20
Argentine government would like to see gas prices follow suit and will=20
conduct public hearings on the matter on 6 March, much to the dislike of=20
Argentine gas distributors. Gas companies state that contrary to the electr=
ic=20
and telephone service sectors, natural gas distribution has a very low prof=
it=20
margin and there is nowhere to cut. The government initiative aims at=20
reducing production costs for manufacturers and large natural gas consumers=
.


ARGENTINA: GAS SECTOR DE-REGULATION DEBATED
Clarin, 04 Mar 2000, p. 22:-
 Argentine gas distribution firms resist the government's decision of=20
de-regulating the local gas sector, as they do not want to share their=20
corporate clients with newcomers and be forced to reduce prices. The=20
Argentine gas sector bureau ENARGAS is encouraging a debate to implement=20
de-regulation measures to authorise companies to be supplied gas directly=
=20
from producers, without the intervention of gas distribution firms. Big fir=
ms=20
demand 10,000 cubic metres of gas daily in Argentina, and all such demand i=
s=20
channelled through gas distribution companies. The government wants to redu=
ce=20
such amount to 5,000 cubic metres allowing several firms to purchase gas=20
directly from producers, possibly implying a 10%-25% reduction in terms of=
=20
prices. In terms of daily distribution of gas, MetroGas leads the sector wi=
th=20
15.2mn cubic metres, followed by Camuzzi Gas Pampeana (10.9mn cubic metres)=

have battled head on with Argentina's gas distributors (Gas Natural BAN,=20
Metrogas, and Camuzzi, among others) to present their case to Enargas. =20


ARGENTINA: ENRON FIGHTS GAS COMPANIES
El Cronista Comercial, 06 Mar 2000, p.7:-
 Public hearings will be held on 7 March in the offices of the Argentine=20
National Gas Regulator (Enargas) to determine whether the Argentine natural=

Argentina's Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) has thrown the first stone in=

the fight between gas distributors and gas brokers that want to enter the=

station of Candiota 3. The contract for its construction was originally 
signed in 1981, but CEEE did not have funds to continue the construction (a 
solution is expected to be reached soon).
The 500 MW gas power station in the city of Triunfo which will be constructed 
by the consortium led by CEEE and also composed by Gaspetro, Sulgas, 
Ipiranga, Techint and RGE Distribuidora with investments of R$ 300mn.
The 750 MW gas power station in the city of Montenegro of the company AES 
with investments of R$ 700mn.
The 250 MW coal power station in the city of Candiota of the company Copelmi, 
which has already made an agreement for technical project, equipment purchase 
and construction with the US company Parsons.

BRAZIL: SALE OF LIGHT'S SHARES WAITS FOR ANEEL 
Gazeta Mercantil, 01 Mar 2000, p. B-4:-
 The BNDESPar, the participations company of the National Bank for Economic

National Electricity Agency (Aneel) to sell its 9.23% of shares in the 
electricity distributor Light, which operates in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
BNDESPar was waiting for the register of the Securities Commission (CVM) on 
February 29th, but it was not possible to be done because Aneel had not 
approved the sale yet.
The reason for the necessity of the approval by Aneel is that the sale of 
these shares will result in the transferring of the control of the company.
The French company Electricite de France (EDF) and the American companies 
Reliant and AES own 11.4% of Light's shares, and EDF will probably acquire 
the shares currently owned by BNDESPar.

BRAZIL: ELECTRICITY SHORTAGE RISK
O Estado de S.Paulo, 01 Mar 2000, p. b-1:-
 The Industries Federation of the Brazilian State of Sao Paulo (Fiesp) is 
worried about the risk of electricity shortage in the next months since rains 
are not being enough to restore water reservoirs of hydro power stations in 
the Brazilian Mid-South Region. And Fiesp believes the problem will be even 
worse in 2001. If the Brazilian economic growth is higher than expected, 
power supply may have problems.
The energy secretary of the state of Sao Paulo, Mauro Arce, says water 
reservoirs level will be less than 60% in April (the usual would be more than 
70%) but even so he does not expect problem with power supply in 2000 because 
new electricity generation projects powered by nuclear energy and thermal 
energy (which do not depend on rains) amounting to 4,200 MW are expected to 
begin to operate in 2000. But he says situation may be bad in 2001, since 
only between 1,300 MW and 1,400 MW new projects are expected to operate in 
that year and reservoirs may be lowered to 10% on average in December 2000, 
being necessary then intense rains to restore reservoirs after that.
The energy secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Mining and Energy, Benedito 
Carraro, says that it is still too soon to affirm that there will be problems 
with power supply in 2001 and water reservoirs and estimations for the next 
months and for 2001 will only be able to be analysed in April 2000.


MEXICO: FUTURE OF BUFETE
El Financiero (Mexico), 01 Mar 2000, online:-

offer of a capital injection from US-based Enron. Creditor banks, including 
Serfin, Citibank and Santander, are expected to absorb part of Bufete's debt 
and to allow Enron to take over administration of the company.


BRAZIL: CSN MAY SELL SHARES OF LIGHT
O Estado de S.Paulo, 01 Mar 2000, p. b-12:-
 The president director of the Brazilian steel company CSN (Companhia 
Siderurgica Nacional), Maria Silvia Bastos Marques, informed that the company 
does not plan to acquire shares of the Brazilian electricity company Light 
which will be sold by BNDESPar (subsidiary of BNDES, the Brazilian National 
Bank for Economic and Social development) and it may even sell the shares of 
Light that CSN owns if there is a good proposal.

BRAZIL: ENRON AGAINST THERMAL STATIONS PROGRAM
O Estado de S.Paulo, 25 Feb 2000, p. b-2:-
 There has been some conflicts between the Brazilian Ministry of Mining and 
Energy and the US energy company Enron, which was against the Brazilian 
thermal power stations program.


BRAZIL: EUR 175MN ORDER FOR ABB ALSTOM POWER
La Tribune, 25-26 Feb 2000, p.15:-
 The European energy group, ABB Alstom Power, is to receive a EUR 175mn share 
as part of a group contract to provide the Brazilian hydraulic power station, 
in Tucurui, with a 3,670 mW section. The site in Tucurui, managed by the 
Brazilian energy company, Eletronorte, is the fourth hydraulic power station 
in the world. ABB represents a consortium of energy groups in this contract, 
representing a total order of EUR 325mn, with the groups, Odebrecht, 
Inepar-Fem and GE Hydro Inepar. This 3,670 mW section will be added to an 
existing 4,250 mW section.


BRAZIL: SUIT TO PAWN STATE'S SHARES OF CELESC
Gazeta Mercantil, 25 Feb 2000, p. a-14:-
 The specific purpose company Invesc, which was created to get funds for the 
government of the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina in 1995, had issued R$ 
100mn debentures using shares of the Brazilian electricity company Celesc as 
guarantee.
But Invesc paid interest of the debentures only in 1997 and so debentures 
holders filed a lawsuit in March 1999 to be paid.
A legal decision was taken on February 22nd 2000 about the matter and then a 
debt of approximately R$ 274mn must be paid to the debentures holders of 
Invesc or 29.32% of the common shares of Celesc owned by the state will be 
pawned (market value of the shares was equal to R$ 171.7mn on February 24th 
2000).
If the shares are transferred to creditors, the state will still own 50.18% 
of the common shares of Celesc and Previ (pension fund of employees of the 
Brazilian bank BB - Banco do Brasil) will increase its participation in 
Celesc from 12.54% to approximately 33%.


BRAZIL: ALCOHOL TENDER HELD ON FEBRUARY 24TH
Gazeta Mercantil, 25 Feb 2000, p. B-24:-
 The volume of 58.65mn of litres of alcohol was acquired in a tender held on 
February 24th 2000 by the Brazilian government.
The total volume offered in this fifth tender was of 60mn of litres. The 
average price paid for the product was of R$ 0.4089 per litre, decreasing by 
0.3% compared to the last tender. The total revenue of the volume sold was of 
R$ 24.098mn.
According to a source of the Ministry of Agriculture, a meeting will be held 
in the last week of February in order to define if more alcohol tenders will 
be held or not.


BRAZIL: FUEL DISTRIBUTION MARKET - PERFORMANCE
O Estado de S.Paulo, 24 Feb 2000, p. b-8:-
 According to a survey carried out by the Brazilian National Trade 
Association of Fuel Distribution Companies (Sindicom), the largest fuel 
distribution companies in Brazil, BR Distribuidora, Shell, Esso, Ipiranga and 
Texaco, registered sales of 2.551mn m3 in January 2000, a fall by 22% 
compared to the 3.276mn m3 sold in January 1999.
Meanwhile, sales registered by smaller companies grew by 34.1% in the same 
comparison basis.
According to Luiz Antonio Viana, president of BR Distribuidora, this was due 
to an unfair competition caused by these smaller companies, which have for 
instance appealed to tax evasion.


BRAZIL: OIL ACCOUNT SURPLUS' GOAL STILL R$ 3.6BN
O Estado de S.Paulo, 25 Feb 2000, p. b-4:-
 The Brazilian government still has as goal to reach a surplus of R$ 3.6bn in 
the Brazilian oil account (difference between imports costs and consumer 
prices)  in 2000 even with the higher oil prices in the last weeks.
The chief of the Economic Advisory of the Ministry of Planning and Budget, 
Jose Guilherme Reis, said that it is still possible to reach that goal and so 
the government is not analysing alternatives.

obliged to refuse 4 proposals in its thermal power stations program, saying 
that there would not be gas supply enough for so many stations.
The program include 41 gas powers stations and some people say gas is not 
enough even for these 41 stations, but some of them will not be constructed 
as expected due to problems to acquire turbines which have high international 
demand and to environmental problems.


ARGENTINA: AES TAKES OVER ALICURA
El Cronista Comercial, 23 Feb 2000, p. 17:-
 US-based energy firm AES Corp. announced the acquisition of a 59% stake in 
Argentina's hydropower station Hidroelectrica Alicura which was in the hands 
of US-based Southern Energy for US$ 205mn. AES is currently concluding the 
works to install a combined cycle station in the province of Buenos Aires, 
Argentina, which will allow this firm to have a 1,500 MW installed thermal 
generation capacity in Argentina. Alicura is located in the province of 
Neuquen, Southern Argentina, and has a 1,000 MW generation capacity. In 
Argentina, AES controls the hydropower generation stations of Cabra Corral, 
El Tunal, Ullum and Quebrada and the thermal stations of Sarmiento, Dique and 
San Nicolas. It also owns the energy distribution firms Edes, Eden and 
Edelap, in the province of Buenos Aires, Such investments allowed AES to 
close 1999 with a US$ 530.4mn billing in Argentina. In alliance with PSEG 
Global, AES is constructing a combined cycle station named AES Parana which 
will demand US$ 448mn having a 826 MW installed capaci
ty. The firm has recently been adjudicated the construction of two hydropower 
stations in the province of San Juan, Caracoles and Punta Negra, with a 120 
MW and 62 MW capacity respectively, which will demand US$ 185mn and US$ 119mn 
in investments respectively. 


ARGENTINA: EDESUR EYES STAFF'S SHARES
Buenos Aires Economico, 23 Feb 2000, p. 5:-
 Argentina's electricity distribution firm Edesur announced it has made a US$ 
1.55 per share offer to take over a 10% stake its staff owns. Initially, the 
offer had been accepted by the board of shareholders of its staff, in a move 
which may involve US$ 120mn. The firm is a subsidiary of Spanish Endesa.


ARGENTINA: RESULTS OF GAS NATURAL BAN
Buenos Aires Economico, 23 Feb 2000, p. 3:-
 Argentina's gas distribution firm Gas Natural BAN closed 1999 with net 
profits of US$ 45.6mn, 4.1% over the positive results it reported back in 
1998. Such positive variation was mainly related to the firm's network 
expansion project, which allowed Gas Natural BAN to gain new clients. By 
December 31, 1999, the firm had 1.187mn clients. It also expanded the sales 
of liquefied natural gas (5.2%) compensating falls of 13.6% in the case of 
the demand of industrial users and of 11.6% in the case of the demand of 
commercial users. 


ARGENTINA: ALCOHOL FUEL COULD SAVE SUGAR SECTOR
La Gaceta (Argentina), 20 Feb 2000, p. 10:-
 The crisis-ridden Argentine sugar sector is looking to promotion of the use 
of alcohol fuel as a solution to its problem of surplus production, which 
reaches some 200,000 tons per year. Most sugar mills already have the 
infrastructure to supply raw material to produce alcohol fuel, and the move 
is seen as an alternative to crop replacement to reduce sugar production, 
given that this would take at least five years to achieve. Supporters also 
argue that high world oil prices imply that production of alcohol fuel would 
offer price advantages, while the use of alcohol as a fuel additive could 
replace the use of petrochemicals which are not renewable resources. 
The North-western refinery Refinor has expressed interest in the use of 
alcohol as a fuel additive in order to replace the use of MTBE, given that 
alcohol has the additional advantage of being exempt from fuel taxes. Refinor 
is testing a new proportion of 10% ethyl alcohol and 90% petrol for such a 
mix.
At the same time, it is argued that the existing 17 distilleries which 
produce 150mn litres of alcohol annually have the capacity to produce 600mn, 
thus allowing them to increase their exports or meet much of the annual 
domestic demand of 850mn litres which would result from the replacement of 
MTBE.
The principal concern expressed over such a programme is that it could cause 
Brazil to demand that Argentina eliminate the tariff barriers imposed on 
subsidised sugar imports from that country.


ARGENTINA: FINDING WAYS TO LOWER GAS PUMP PRICES
El Cronista Comercial, 23 Feb 2000, p.4:-
 The Argentine government announced yesterday that it will introduce a 10 
point voluntary plan aimed at increasing competition in gasoline prices. The 
measures would at best have an effect in the medium or long term. Firstly, 
the Energy Secretary will facilitate the import of gasoline for independent 
importers. Service stations would also have to register their contracts with 
gasoline suppliers in order to prevent taxation that would effect competitive 
pricing. The government will try to ensure that Repsol sells off some of its 
service stations at competitive conditions. Moreover, the Energy Secretary 
will report comparative gasoline prices and determine whether there is 
overcharging. The Secretary will keep a register of wholesale diesel prices 
and will force service stations to clearly advertise their prices. The 
government will further investigate competition practices by oil companies 
and will step up efforts to eliminate black market fuel sales.


BOLIVIA: OIL PRODUCTION FELL 15.43% IN 1999
El Diario (Bolivia), 22 Feb 2000, p. 1:-
 Bolivia produced 10.679mn barrels of oil in 1999, 15.43% under the figure 
reported during the previous year, according to this country's statistics 
bureau INE. Bolivia's main petroleum pole, the department of Cochabamba, 
produced 5.1mn barrels (47.83% of the oil produced by the whole country) 
followed by Santa Cruz (39.98%), Chuquisaca (7.47%) and Tarija (4.74%). 
In the case of natural gas, Bolivia's output of 1999 was 15.9% under the 
figure reported in 1998. The most important producer of natural gas was the 
department of Santa Cruz (41.08mn cubic feet and 44.53% of the overall 
produced in Bolivia), followed by Tarija (25.58%), Cochabamba (19.06%) and 
Chuquisaca (10.82%). 46.6% of Bolivia's output of natural gas was exported to 
Brazil.

Brazil Power: October's Industrial Recovery and January's Rains... - CERA 
Alert


Brazilian power demand growth strengthened in October and November, rising 
1.8 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, above 1998 levels for those months 
(see Figure 1). Industrial power demand led this growth, as industrial 
physical output continued to recover along with Brazil's economy. Commercial 
sector power demand growth also remained strong, but residential consumption 
increased only as a result of the addition of new billed customers, as demand 
per customer declined (see Table 1). Recent legislation to reduce the 
government's fiscal imbalances will likely continue to support Brazil's 
economic recovery, leading to higher power demand growth in the coming months.

Thermal power generation has taken on an increasing percentage of Brazil's 
total supply, substituting for hydro generation because of abnormally low 
rainfall throughout the spring months (see Table 2). Brazil's thermal 
capacity is limited, however, and hydro reserves to meet growing demand 
reached critically low levels by the end of December. The torrential rains in 
early January reduced the threat of drought-induced shortages, but by the end 
of the month reservoir stored energy levels in the South, Southeast, and 
Central West regions were only half of those in January 1999. Stored water in 
the North and Northeast regions was also significantly below the year-earlier 
level. Although hydro output has kept pace with demand and reservoir water 
levels continue to rise, the increase is much slower than historical rainy 
season buildups. Sustained rains must continue to replenish reservoir volumes 
for several months in order to eliminate the risk of power shortages.

Thermal Generation Remained High as Water Levels Stayed Low

Thermal generation continued to increase in December, reaching 1,847 
gigawatt-hours (GWh), or 6.3 percent of Brazil's total generation (see Table 
3). This increased reliance on thermal power was in response to the 
critically low reservoir water volumes resulting from Brazil's recent drought 
(see Figures 2 and 3). Although thermal generation was tapped to replace 
hydro power to the extent possible, hydro generators continued to produce 
power at levels similar to last year's in order to meet growing demand. The 
strong rains in early January reduced the threat of drought-induced 
shortages, but by the end of the month reservoir stored energy levels in the 
South, Southeast, and Central West regions fell again to only 50 percent of 
levels in January 1999, raising concerns among government regulators.

Stored water volumes in the North and Northeast regions were also 
significantly below year-earlier levels, demonstrating that Brazil's power 
capacity problem is affecting nearly all regions of the country. Brazil is 
expected to add 1,200 megawatt (MW) of new thermal capacity in 2000, as well 
as a further 1,309 MW of nuclear capacity when the Angra II unit enters 
commercial operation. This new capacity will help meet the expected increase 
in demand growth as Brazil's economy strengthens throughout the year but will 
do little to mitigate power shortages if the current rainfall is insufficient 
to replenish Brazil's reservoirs.

Industrial Activity: Recovery in October and November Boosts Power Demand

October met expectations of a gradual recovery in industrial activity. This 
trend continued to gather steam in November, pushing power demand growth to 
levels not seen since April 1998. October's industrial physical output 
expanded 1.6 percent compared with that of September and 2.5 percent compared 
with that of October 1998, reaching the highest level since September 1998. 
In November, industrial output slowed slightly, dropping 0.1 percent compared 
with October 1999, but remained 4.8 percent above November 1998 levels. Power 
demand grew accordingly, reaching 3.5 percent in October and 3.8 in November, 
making industrial power demand Brazil's fastest-growing sector for the month. 
The year-to-date contraction in industrial output continued to shrink, with 
cumulative output through November only 1.5 percent lower than the same 
period in 1998. This recovery was enough to bring year-to-date power demand 
into positive growth numbers for the first time, increasing 0.5 percent over 
J!
anuary-November 1998.

October and November brought the strongest growth to the paper, beverage, and 
transportation materials sectors, supported by improved prices in 
international markets and the start of the summer. Consumer durable goods and 
capital goods also expanded strongly in October and November, rising from 
their weak performance of the first half of the year. Year-to-date growth has 
been strongest in oil, oil product, and export-oriented sectors, whereas 
consumer durable goods and capital goods have suffered the greatest 
contraction.

On a regional basis, all states with a few exceptions showed positive growth 
in industrial output in October and November. Only the Northeast region and 
state of Bahia (still suffering from a lower level of oil industry activity) 
reported negative performance in October 1998 (2.5 and 3.2 percent, 
respectively), and Paran? was the only negative performer in November. S?o 
Paulo registered its first positive performance (1.1 percent) in the past 14 
months, and four states registered double-digit growth: Esp?rito Santo (19 
percent), Minas Gerais (13.8 percent), Ceara (11.9 percent), and Rio Grande 
do Sul (10 percent). Rio de Janeiro and Esp?rito Santo showed the strongest 
year-to-date growth, while S?o Paulo's total 1999 output remained 5.5 percent 
below that of 1998.

Part of the recent increase in year-over-year monthly output can be 
attributed to the declining production levels in 1998 as the industrial 
sector had already begun to contract by October 1998. In recent months, 
however, there has been a slow but steady growth in industrial output, led by 
a recovery in international markets for export products and an improvement in 
the economic situation. This growth is expected to continue in the coming 
months as Brazil's economy continues to strengthen.

Residential and Commercial Demand Growth Slows

Residential demand grew slowly in October and November, increasing only 0.1 
and 1.0 percent year-on-year, respectively. Even this limited growth is due 
entirely to the addition of new billable customers, which has expanded the 
customer base by 4.6 percent in the 12 months ending in November 1999. During 
that same period, per-capita power consumption declined 1.6 percent owing to 
cooler average temperatures in 1999 and a 19 percent decline in purchases of 
domestic electronic goods. The surge in consumer purchases following the Real 
Plan stabilization has now subsided, and the reduction in consumer buying 
power following the economic downturn has helped limit recent sales and use 
of electricity-intensive consumer goods.

Commercial demand grew 3.6 percent in October and 3.2 percent in November, 
slowing slightly from recent months to give year-to-date growth of 4.9 
percent in November. Much of the growth in commercial demand was due to 
internal tourism, which has benefited from the real devaluation. Increasing 
electricity intensity of new businesses has also played a role, as new 
businesses have greater electricity needs than their predecessors.

Conclusion

Although the recent rains have removed any risk of power shortages in the 
near term, reservoir water levels remain dangerously low, leading the 
government to develop an emergency thermal capacity building program. The 
current rate at which dams are being replenished is insufficient to meet the 
nation's needs within the historical rainy season. Either heavier rains or an 
extended season will be needed to avoid drought-related power outages toward 
the end of 2000. In the interim, thermal generation will remain higher than 
historical averages and new units, including Cuiaba and Angra II, will help 
increase thermal power contribution to the total generation mix.

As Brazil's economy continues to strengthen in 2000, power demand growth will 
steadily increase. This growth will be felt first in the industrial sector, 
as power demand rises with increased physical output. As consumer confidence 
and buying power increase in tandem with economic growth, commercial and 
residential power consumption will also return to precrisis levels, 
surpassing 5 percent growth.

This combination of demand growth and uncertain water supply will greatly 
increase the pressure for new generation capacity. Many risks and 
uncertainties remain, however, limiting any project's ability to reach 
financial closure. The continued delay in moving projects forward, combined 
with an additional one to two years of construction once projects are made 
viable, will further tighten Brazil's supply-demand balance in the coming 
year, regardless of the availability of water.

Investment Highlights:

* A swift victory in AES/Southern's new federal appeal would be a
strong short-term catalyst. Although the STJ should be more politically
neutral than the MG courts, at this stage a favorable outcome is still far
from assured.
* Even if the partners are reinstated under an injunction, the
original lawsuit is still expected to run for several years; ongoing
conflict with the State will likely weigh on Cemig's fundamental performance
and valuation.
* Cemig's stock is down by 10% since we initiated coverage on January
13 and, at 5.0x 2001E cash flow, downside risk is now more limited.
Considering the ongoing risks, however, we still see more fundamental upside
in Copel (ELP; D-1-1-7; US$8 1/16).
Fundamental Highlights:
* AES/Southern filed a new injunction with the STJ, a federal court in
Brasilia. This seems designed to fast-forward the dispute into a more
neutral political arena.
* A previous direct appeal to the STJ was rejected pending the state
ruling. While a similar rejection is possible this time, the STJ could issue
its first ruling as early as this week.

Investment Highlights:

* Following the rejection of their second federal appeal today,
AES/Southern must now wait for the state court (TJMG) to issue its final
verdict before taking further action.
* Although a final state court opinion is due imminently, the federal
court's latest ruling opens the risk that Minas Gerais will continue
stalling the process at the state level.
* We still believe that the legal battle will drag on longer than
generally expected. In addition, even if the partners are eventually
reinstated under an injunction, ongoing conflict with the State (the
original lawsuit may run for years) will likely weigh heavily on Cemig's
fundamentals and stock performance.
Fundamental Highlights:
* The STJ, a federal court in Brasilia, today rejected the most recent
protective injunction filed by AES/Southern in their battle with the MG
government for control of Cemig.
* In rejecting AES/Southern's injunction the STJ upheld an action
filed by Minas Gerais on Tuesday. The State argued that there were no
material developments since STJ's rejection of a similar AES/Southern appeal
late last year.

Investment Highlights:

* AES/Southern executives will likely return to Cemig following
yesterday's ruling. Even so, ongoing legal conflict with the State and the
suspended veto rights will likely weigh on fundamentals and stock
performance.
* We expect the stock to remain volatile, but essentially range-bound.
Periods of optimism are as likely to be offset by disappointment with the
protracted ongoing legal process.
* Stories of a possible buyout of AES/Southern have circulated
recently in the news media. We view these as both improbable and not
necessarily positive.
Fundamental Highlights:
* The latest step in AES/Southern's legal battle with the Minas Gerais
government came yesterday with the TJMG (state court) clarifying its
previous divided verdict. The outcome effectively confines AES/Southern to a
minority shareholder position.
* Next steps are contingent on the publication of the official TJMG
ruling which may yet take 30 days or more. An appeal to the STJ (federal
court) may now be allowed, although further rounds at the state level cannot
be ruled out.

Investment Highlights:

* Following two years dominated by drought and corporate activity,
regulatory reform will be a key investment driver for the Chilean electric
utilities during 2000. On January 25, the National Energy Commission (CNE)
published draft legislation which, so far at least, has been met with
studied silence on the part of the companies.
* With a new Government due to take office on March 11, it is very
unlikely that the current draft will be the final one. In addition, the
approval process for any new legislation of this nature is likely to take at
least several months. Substantial revisions are expected, but to the extent
that elements of the draft are eventually incorporated into final
legislation, we would see negative investment consequences for most of the
leading Chilean electricity stocks.
* While aware that the draft is by no means definitive, our intention
in this report is to use the proposals as a framework to discuss key
regulatory areas where changes to existing legislation are anticipated.
