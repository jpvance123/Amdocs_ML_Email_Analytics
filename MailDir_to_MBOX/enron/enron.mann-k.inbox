	Jim,

	Per your and others' authority, on Friday, December 15,  I sent to Sharron West, the lead adjuster for Underwriters on the above-referenced three insurance claims, a request for an extension of time by which the insureds could filed suit against Underwriters through and including March 15, 2002.

	I will give you a call on Wednesday, and if you have heard nothing by then from Underwriters, we can discuss a follow-up.  I would greatly prefer to have some response before the intervention of the Christmas holidays.

	I will keep you advised.

	Britt

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

We have failed to pay when due over $1.5 million for gas purchased from the City in connection with our exercise of our prepetition call rights to the MW, plus we are in breach of our prepetition and post petition O&M payment obligations. City has also alleged anticipatory breach in connection with our press release stating we were "suspending all payments". I asked Jeffrey to send you a copy of the City's letter. I still haven't had time to review the Participation Agreement, but I understand ENA's bankruptcy ( ENA is guarantor of Sandhill's obligations) was not an event of default or otherwise did not give the City a termination right.

At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?  I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.  If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.

More to consider!

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

Please keep in mind that because of how the Developer's Agreement is structured (i.e. it's an "option" because we must first apply for a building permit to trigger the payment), there is no current payment obligation under the ENA guarantee. I also recollect that the ENA guarantee is a payment guarantee only.

Bart:

This is Fred.  I am working on Kathleen's computer to facilitate easy Livelink access.

It appears that an Unconditional Guarantee Agreement was executed between the City of Deerfield and DBEC, L.L.C. prior to the execution of the Agreement Related to The Use and Development of Real Property (dated June 29, 2001).  We do not have a copy of the executed version of the Guarantee Agreement, but Greenberg & Traurig should have one.

The Guarantee Agreement obligates DBEC to make a non-refundable payment on or before 9/30/01 (this payment was made) and a second payment of $1,000,000 "subsequent to DBEC's application but prior to its receipt of the first building permit or engineering work permit for the Facility".

Kay has more detailed knowledge of this Guarantee and other Deerfield and Pompano documents through her role in the development of these projects.  Please call her for specific information on project Agreements.

Call Kathleen or I if we can help in this process.

Fred

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Hey Mom, I know you remember Uncle Mike's quotation from PopPop's
funeral...A girl I know has it on her instant messenger with a little
change, and I like her version a lot, too. Hers is: "Work like you don't
need the money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like no one is
watching." Just something more to think about (as if we don't have enough!).

Love,

Paige

What if we purchase the switch from a 3rd party, i.e. CES?  How would that affect your 1st 2 bullets?

Subject:	USTeleNet Transaction

Just to follow-up on our discussion yesterday regarding the accounting treatment assuming that USTeleNet owns the switch and that we purchase the switch and lease it back to them under a "capital" lease, the following would occur:

The asset would stay on their books (however it would be "marked-up" to FMV as evidenced by the purchase price)
They would defer the gain, if any, over the asset's life.
They would record a payable on their balance sheet and recognize interest expense in their P&L as payments are made
We would record the payment of cash to them and book a receivable and deferred interest income (to be recognized over the lease term)

Essentially we are lending them money equal to the FMV of their asset and receiving interest payments in return (i.e. direct financing lease)

I would be happy to go into more detail at your request.  Please let me know as issues develop and I will assist as necessary.

I just checked our first presentation to them, and it didn't have the "confidential stamp on them.  Ideally, we'd like to have that covered, but don't think it is critical if the information there is not.

Going forward, I believe our revised proposal already has the stamp on every page.  If not, we will ensure that it is marked.

Are you guys okay with everything else?

- R

Rahil,

Have we given them anything in writing yet, and are you willing to mark everything?

Kay,  Here are Central Virginia's comments regarding the CA.  As you can see, they want all information marked "confidential".  I spoke to Butch Solomon this afternoon with Suzette and tried to explain to him that it was not our normal policy to mark all confidential information "confidential", but I guess I did not persuade him.

Please advise.

Suzette,

    Pursuant to our conversation of earlier this afternoon, I am attaching a revised version of your proposed confidentiality agreement. The revised version is in Word format and my suggested changes are highlighted as you requested in your 10/19/01 email transmitting the proposed agreement.
    My first change is at the end of paragraph 2. It addresses my concern that any documents you give us that you consider confidential information will be so marked on every page, while taking our conversation into account and allowing other nonwritten confidential information provided to be covered as well.
    The next two changes are the typo we discussed in paragraph 3 and an additional sentence at the end of that paragraph. The sentence is added simply to recognize the need for timely provision of a Public Disclosure Copy in a regulatory or court proceeding.
    Finally, I have added the phrase found at the end of the first sentence of paragraph 7 to the end of the third sentence of that paragraph. I believe this addition is consistent with Enron's intent, but makes it more explicit.
    I plan to be in the office until about 7:00 pm EDT this evening and until about 2:30 pm tomorrow, and I will be happy to discuss my proposed changes with you and your attorneys at any time during that period.

Best Regards,
Butch

At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?  I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.  If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.

More to consider!

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

    Kay,
          I agree with your comments on the selection of the ALJ.   The
following is our response to your two questions :              Ryan and I
believe that we can set forth a number of differences between the two cases
such as the site -specific air quality impact analysis required under the
applicable regulations;  the differences in parties to the proceedings; the
different impacts to the various petitioning local governments depending
upon their distance from the facility in question; the different phases of
discovery that the cases are presently in, and the like.  Nevertheless, the
foregoing may not be sufficient grounds to preclude the consolidation based
upon a minimal delay in the proceedings, as we understand that DEP is
proposing.
         More importantly, we previously expressed our concern with the
company's current position in the Deerfield proceeding relative to the
proposed Nox limitation of 36 ppm. Because DEP has not been persuaded to
date to increase the permit limitation to 42 ppm and because Enron did not
legally oppose such a condition in the Deerfield permit, then Enron's
ability to raise such an objection at this point appears to be impaired.
(There may be an argument that Enron noted its objection within the permit
comment period, which terminated after the deadline for filing any legal
objection, and therefore Enron noted its objection on the record and no one
is prejudiced by asserting its objection within the pending proceeding at
this stage, since discovery has only just been initiated).   In light of
these circumstances,  we could advise DEP that Enron's position is that it
does not object to the consolidation as long as the trial date is in January
2002 and as long as the parties  recognize that Enron will challenge the
proposed Nox limitation of 36 ppm under backup fuel use conditions with
respect to both permits in a consolidated proceeding.    
        Please advise me of your thoughts. 
           --Kerri

Thanks for the clear report.
 
On the issue of the judge, I suggest we opt for whoever you think will
be most favorable, assuming we can get a hearing in January.
 
On the consolidation, what would we use as a basis for the objection? If
we don't have a decent basis I don't think we should object.
 
On a related issue, assuming we are going forward with the fuel oil
option on Deerfield, how are we going to put the 36 vs 42 issue in play?
Thanks,
 
Kay

	Subject: DEP Air Permits-Conversation w/ Martha Nebelsiek re
Consolidation & Related Matters 
	
	

	       Kay, Steve, Ben and Ryan, 
	       I spoke with Martha today on the subject referred to
above and she 
	advised me of the following :  
	      1.   DEP is not contemplating a single, consolidated
permit but an air 
	permit  for each of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach
facilities.   
	       2.   The petitioning local governments have no objection
to the 
	consolidation proposed by DEP (no surprises there).   
	        3.   Martha wants our input as to which ALJ we would
prefer to hear 
	the case should DEP's request for consolidation be granted.   (
The upside 
	to suggesting Judge Alexander is that we know that he have
already reserved 
	his time for a 4-day hearing in January.  Otherwise, we might
choose Judge 
	Stampelos based upon the prior comments that we have received
from our 
	Tallahassee attorneys, although both Judges were considered to
be good.).   
	          4. Martha indicated previously that she is looking for
a hearing 
	in January, depending upon which ALJ hears the case and his
particular 
	schedule. 
	          5.  Martha advised me that she will file her request
for 
	consolidation late tomorrow afternoon.  I told her, as we
discussed in our 
	conference call, that if she does not hear from me to the
contrary, then we 
	oppose the consolidation at this time.   
	          6.  Martha agreed to provide us with the permit
language that DEP 
	is proposing in connection with its Notice of Change of Agency
Position  on 
	the Pompano Beach proceeding as soon as Al Linero completes the
drafting and 
	she reviews the proposed permit conditions with him.  Martha
expects to 
	provide us with the proposed permit language next  Monday or
Tuesday. 
	          7.  The petitioning local governments have served DEP
with 
	discovery.  I have yet to receive a copy of the discovery but
Martha intends 
	to meet with Al Linero this Friday to discuss  DEP's response. 
	          Based upon the foregoing, please advise me if you want
me to 
	convey any further message to Martha prior to her filing of the
motion for 
	consolidation tomorrow afternoon.  Specifically, I am interested
in your 
	thoughts on our preference on the Judge that will hear the
proceeding, if 
	consolidated, and whether we have any objection to DEP's filing
the motion 
	for consolidation in which she will note our objection.  As we
discussed in 
	our conference call, we can assert our position more fully in a
subsequent 
	response to the motion for consolidation and can withdraw our
objection if 
	we change our mind.     
	         Thanks !  Kerri

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

Absolutely!  Almost all of the original contract will go away, but Rahil and I will go through it first thing in the morning and mark it up for you.  I know Rahil has language regarding the index from one of the traders that we will forward as well.

In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:

1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.

2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.

I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.

If the fair market value of the LLC's assets is less than $50 million (which
seems to be the case), then no filing is required.  If more than $50
million, then NorthWestern needs to make a filing, but Enron does not (as it
only owns 20%).

NorthWestern is making noises about exercising their call on the
remaining member interests.  Total deal value was originally $48m
(refunding to $43).  Is an HSR filing required?  Just a short, cheap
answer required. (sigh)

Thanks,

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

I'm in, but with lots going on.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil

I don't know what to tell you, but I don't think I can go back for more changes as we have to close the deal today, unless there is something that is an absolute deal killer, I'd like to go with what we have as the VP on the worldcom side who helped us get these provisions is in transit.

With respect to your schedule, I would need some of your time today, let me know how we can make that happen.

I'm more concerned  that Akami doesn't have access to whatever the website is.  At the least, they need to make the site available to Akami as well. Agreed?  We can revise along that line if you prefer.

		The addition of the clause was as a compromise for them to give notification within 5 business days, the original doc had no notification timeframes.  In a case of a force Majeure, we would know immediately as the services would get affected (loss of connectivity, no response times, etc,  the customer (Akamai) would then call our NOC (Network Operation Center) who would escalate the call within the 1st hour to the desk. It would be our job then to check the status tool that they are talking about...

				Lets talk about this today,  In general I'm OK with it as that is the same tool from which we monitor SLAs, performance measurements, etc...  basically if there is a force Majeure that impacts the service, that is where we we would go (web page) to check on status..

					WorldCom has an addition I don't like at all.  It is at the end of 15, which says they can give us notice of force majeure by some "on line tool".  What is that all about?  That is a recent adder which it would be very helpful if we can get rid of it. Alternatively, they need to give our End User access to this tool.

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation.
Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do
so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not
consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would
need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't
think the Margate issue is enough, either.)

I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of
December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue
the hearing until January anyway.

    Kay, Steve, Ben, and Debbie --  
        I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP
is
intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings
into
a single proceeding.  To that end,  Martha believes that the proceedings
should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the
cases
is consolidated into the other.  Martha believes that consolidation is
appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are
consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the
sites
as one.   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted
our
position on the proposed consolidation.  I told her that we would likely
oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing
our
position.  
        Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages.    The
cases, if
consolidated, may be less expensive to try.  Yet, the hearing in
December
may be at risk if consolidation occurs.    In addition, the parties are
not
exactly the same in each proceeding  (Margate is not a participant in
the
Deerfield proceeding).  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible
with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation.   If she does not
hear
back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate
that
Enron objects to the consolidation.    
         Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enron's response
to
DEP's Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit.   I promised
not
to file any response last week, given the pending settlement
negotiations
but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days. 
         Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation.  
            --Kerri    .

Good to have you back, Kay.  I was very sorry to hear about your father passing away. I hope you are doing OK --  Please accept my condolences.

Regarding your questions:
1. I believe you have an electronic copy of the lease between UST and CES.  There is also a term sheet which I will try to dig up.  I will ask UST if a signed lease exists.

2. Working on the RTU -- I am told we will have it "any day."  We shall see.

3. Should CES or their attys have this?  I will ask them.  It would nonetheless be good to investigate the bankruptcy proceeding independently to verify things (and to see what CES paid for the switch).  Can you do this?

I will be reachable Friday at 732-887-0215 and back in Houston Monday.

Eric

Hi Eric,

I'm back in the office, and am working on this deal again.  Seems like there are a couple of items which need to be obtained so we can go forward expeditiously. Specifically, we need copies of the following documents:

	Lease agreement between CES and UST.

	Nortel RTU terms.

	Bankruptcy order allowing the sale of the switch from TCP to CES. 

I can speak with US Telenet's attorney regarding these requests, if you can get his/her name and number or email address.

I know there are some other issues, but getting these documents will really help.

Thanks,

Kay

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.  
 

For enrollment, or more information on these courses, please log on to http://elm.enron.com.

We have failed to pay when due over $1.5 million for gas purchased from the City in connection with our exercise of our prepetition call rights to the MW, plus we are in breach of our prepetition and post petition O&M payment obligations. City has also alleged anticipatory breach in connection with our press release stating we were "suspending all payments". I asked Jeffrey to send you a copy of the City's letter. I still haven't had time to review the Participation Agreement, but I understand ENA's bankruptcy ( ENA is guarantor of Sandhill's obligations) was not an event of default or otherwise did not give the City a termination right.

At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?  I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.  If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.

More to consider!

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

Kay,

I just received a call from GE (Jeff Darst and Steve Swift) in which they said that NorthWestern was asking for GE to sign documents that would enable NorthWestern to buy out Enron remaining interest in the LLC.  I am unaware of any discussions with NorthWestern with regards to this.  Please give me a call, and be advised that Jeff and Steve are going to call you.

Thanks,

Andy,

I just heard from the folks over at Westinghouse.  They have agreed to our proposed language.  Are you able to work with Ann Davis (the lawyer at Westinghouse) to bring this to a close?  Her phone number is 407-736-2017.  I would certainly appreciate it.

I think we can skip the Thompson site since we only did it as an accomodation (it's not the primary site). I don't think we can justify paying Mancini. We'll need to try to negotiate some sort of free extension. In any case, by the time Mancini's due, we should have expressions of interest from prospective buyers. At that time, if we need to pay the option renewal premium (and we can't negotiate an extension from Mancini) we can pay the option premium.

Kay,

Here is the draft form of the contract I spoke to you about on Friday.  I've also sent this to the contract administrative group.  If this draft is ok to use, I believe the only thing we have to add to this is the 'PSA'.  We could consider this document as our 'Scope of Work' or 'Statement of Work'.

I'll be out of the office on Monday, however you can reach me by cell, 713-516-7582  or tex pager 888-662-8505.

Thanks,

This should be unit contigent power.  The way that I see this happening is that we will buy the power from Cogentrix at their bus and then sell to a Counter Party at the same bus. We will keep our share of the profit and pay Cogentrix their share.  If there is no profit then we will pay them whatever the sell goes for.  Example being:  If the Bogie is $35 and they want us to sell power and all we can get is $30, then we will pay Cogentrix $30.  There may be times where we have to procure transmission.  In this situation I see us passing through these costs to Cogentrix.  As far as the Bogie, they will tell us what the Bogie is on a day-ahead basis.

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

I got this email from my professor who didn't seem at all affected when I
told him my grandfather was going in for surgery. You never know who is
going to be touched. Also, my girls here gave me flowers when I got home.
It's really strange to be here where everyone is really concentrated on
homework and listening to music, etc... I cried a lot on the way back here,
and I turned off the radio for a long time. I never do that, but I felt like
I needed to talk to PopPop in quiet. This stinks. My heart hurts. I know
it'll get better, but it was so recently that we were all laughing in the
hospital room. I just have so many questions that will never be answered.
Well I need to get moving on my group project. Keep in touch.

	By my calculation this payment is not due today.  I have advised Northwestern's attorney of this fact.

	Dave Duran wants to be advised prior to this money being sent.

	Thanks,

The lease is freely assignable. The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible. 

Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas? 

Still looking for a copy of the letter from Morris. My fax number is 63491 if someone has it handy. 

Thanks, 

Kay

Kay at this time MDEA has $292,544.40 that they owe us.  We have approximately $360,000  that we have made in profit according to our P&L from Risk.  At this time we are not doing any buying or selling for MDEA.  We run the load forecast, determine the position and then we get a market price from WRI.  We then call MDEA and inform them of the Market and their position.  They then tell us to buy the power from WRI.  We call WRI and they bill MDEA, not us.  We then do the tag.

Kay,

I just received a call from GE (Jeff Darst and Steve Swift) in which they said that NorthWestern was asking for GE to sign documents that would enable NorthWestern to buy out Enron remaining interest in the LLC.  I am unaware of any discussions with NorthWestern with regards to this.  Please give me a call, and be advised that Jeff and Steve are going to call you.

Thanks,

Chris

Per your request, we have reviewed the applicable provisions governing
exercise of the put option and believe that the following documents are
required:
 
1.  Notice of Exercise;
2.  Assignment of Limited Liability Company Interest;
3.  Resignation of Director; and
4.  Membership Certificate with Stock Power completed on reverse.
 
Initial drafts of the first three items listed above are enclosed for your
review.  Once we have your comments, we will make the necessary changes and
prepare corresponding documents for CA Energy Development II, LLC.
 
We note that the put option is exercisable (a) after Commercial Operation or
(b) at any time IF (unless SEL waives this requirement) GE acknowledges and
confirms that the transfer of the ENA Interest will not prejudice the LLC's
rights under the Facility Agreement.  We are unsure whether  commercial
operation has been achieved.  Accordingly, we have included in the Notice of
Exercise a waiver by SEL of the requirement for a confirmation and
acknowledgement from GE.  Please review the enclosed and advise of any
comments at your convenience.  Thank you.

I talked with Richard and asked that we have a time to talk generally about the process for holding an auction and what we need to include in CA's and Info Memo's etc. I will copy Kay to see if she thinks her meeting with you about the Westinghouse turbines and maybe the City of Austin deal will fill up the hour that she has reserved for the meeting room.  If not, could we have a general discussion about auctions at say 10:30?  Kay do you mind if we have a larger crowd in your meeting?

       Kay, Steve, Ben and Ryan,
       I spoke with Martha today on the subject referred to above and she
advised me of the following :  
      1.   DEP is not contemplating a single, consolidated permit but an air
permit  for each of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach facilities.   
       2.   The petitioning local governments have no objection to the
consolidation proposed by DEP (no surprises there).   
        3.   Martha wants our input as to which ALJ we would prefer to hear
the case should DEP's request for consolidation be granted.   (  The upside
to suggesting Judge Alexander is that we know that he have already reserved
his time for a 4-day hearing in January.  Otherwise, we might choose Judge
Stampelos based upon the prior comments that we have received from our
Tallahassee attorneys, although both Judges were considered to be good.).   
          4. Martha indicated previously that she is looking for a hearing
in January, depending upon which ALJ hears the case and his particular
schedule. 
          5.  Martha advised me that she will file her request for
consolidation late tomorrow afternoon.  I told her, as we discussed in our
conference call, that if she does not hear from me to the contrary, then we
oppose the consolidation at this time.   
          6.  Martha agreed to provide us with the permit language that DEP
is proposing in connection with its Notice of Change of Agency Position  on
the Pompano Beach proceeding as soon as Al Linero completes the drafting and
she reviews the proposed permit conditions with him.  Martha expects to
provide us with the proposed permit language next  Monday or Tuesday. 
          7.  The petitioning local governments have served DEP with
discovery.  I have yet to receive a copy of the discovery but Martha intends
to meet with Al Linero this Friday to discuss  DEP's response. 
          Based upon the foregoing, please advise me if you want me to
convey any further message to Martha prior to her filing of the motion for
consolidation tomorrow afternoon.  Specifically, I am interested in your
thoughts on our preference on the Judge that will hear the proceeding, if
consolidated, and whether we have any objection to DEP's filing the motion
for consolidation in which she will note our objection.  As we discussed in
our conference call, we can assert our position more fully in a subsequent
response to the motion for consolidation and can withdraw our objection if
we change our mind.     
         Thanks !  Kerri

Chip:

As we discussed a couple of days ago, we have prepared a payment direction letter regarding our final payment from AES on the Haywood deal. The letter directs AES to make payment directly to our consultant ($100k) with the balance to us by check ($2,010k).

Please let Kay, Staurt and I know if you're OK with this (via return e-mail), and we will send it to AES. Stuart, Kay and I have each reviewed the letter.

I expect that we should be in a position to receive these funds hopefully late next week.

Thanks,

Ben

Attached is the proposed CA for Western Resources, Inc. that Rudy requested today.  It is identical to the proposed Dynegy CA.

Rudy,  Reagan suggested to use the same form and scope of discussions as the Dynegy CA.  Let Kay and I know if you think there should be any changes.

Kay,

Do you know if this invoice was ever sent to NorthWestern at or after
closing.  Theresa has no record of ENA receiving the $48,000 for storage
after June 30.

Rhonda,

Can you help me clear this up?  I printed all of this from Livelink by using your report, so if I am missing pieces should I check out the files from the file room to get it or what?  Please advise.

Thanks,
Genia

Kay,

In going through the contracts assigned to us, I have determined that we do not have all contracts necessary to evaluate our exposure/potential work out of the various transaction.  To summarize:

1.Oglethorpe Power Corp.:  The Interchange Agreement supplied is expired.  Is there an amendment or extension?

2.Ameren Services Company:  The contract is sell only (Ameren sells to EPMI), but we have positions in our books whereby Ameren has the obligation to purchase from EPMI.  There must be a MPPSA or another contract that allows for purchases as well.  Ameren has the obligation to purchase 300-400 MW on-peak for next summer.  This one should be a relatively easy sell/assignment to a third party.

3.Connecticut Light & Power:  Termination is subject to conditions outlined in the Mid-Connecticut Project Termination, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (I think this is the bigger CRRA agreement).  Jim Grace and Sheila Tweed are the responsible parties for the CRRA workout.  As this contract is inextricably linked, shouldn't they take over this contract as well?

4.GPU:  I believe there are additional contracts out there  governing transactions between EPMI and the various GPU subsidiaries.  Will you have a search run on the follow company names?

GPU Services
GPU Energy
Jersey Central Power & Light Company
Metropolitan Edison Company
Pennsylvania Electric Company

Thanks!

Heather

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Subject:	ENEL Proposal - Rio Bravo IV

I talked with Julie Smith right after lunch about ENA responding to Tennessee's South Texas Expansion.  The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e. Thursday, November 29th).

I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA.  That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements.  I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project.  She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA.   

Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that "due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001.  So it looks like ENEL has about another week to work on their proposal.

Ruth

P.S.  I just got off the phone with Tennessee Gas Pipeline to thank them for extending the Open Season for us and give him an update on participating in the expansion.  He indicated that "another international company" had just submitted an Open Season response.  So it looks like ENEL has submitted the necessary paperwork.

Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.

Forward Email to Administrative Staff
Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you.

Contact Us
If you would like to provide feedback for the Single Sign-On effort, send an email to sso@enron.com. If you have issues or concerns regarding this change, please contact the Resolution Center at ext. 3-1411.


Regards,
The Legal Edge and Single Signon Teams

Kay,

I got your voice mail and I'm glad the plant was pretty.  It is Mat Gimble's favorite florist.  Hope you are doing well, although I know what a total mental strain a parent's death can put on you.  I'm very sorry you and your family had to go through this.

I had to go to Waco yesterday for a stepbrother's funeral.   He was 47 and had a very aggressive form of cancer that began with a lump on his neck last January.  I'm very glad I went and it was one of the most positive funerals I have ever attended.  They had the burial first and a celebration of his life at the church after (lots of music as he and his family all have beautiful voices).

Attached is a Statutory Power of Attorney I got from my old law firm today (let me know if you want any changes made).  It is my favorite form because the powers are both specific and broad.  Should your mother want to limit any of the powers, she simply needs to line through them.  I will be happy to notarize her signature if you want me to.  The following is sort a "trick question" in the instrument:

CHOOSE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING ALTERNATIVES BY CROSSING OUT THE ALTERNATIVE NOT CHOSEN:
(A)	This power of attorney is not affected by my subsequent disability or incapacity.
(B)	This power of attorney becomes effective upon my disability or incapacity.
YOU SHOULD CHOOSE ALTERNATIVE (A) IF THIS POWER OF ATTORNEY IS TO BECOME EFFECTIVE ON THE DATE IT IS EXECUTED.
IF NEITHER (A) NOR (B) IS CROSSED OUT, IT WILL BE ASSUMED THAT YOU CHOSE ALTERNATIVE (A).

For obvious reasons, your mother should cross through (B) or not cross through either.

I want to make a date.  We need a sleepover.  Doesn't need to be fancy  - my mom says the Palacios facialist is great.  Remember the best massage lady was from Palacios? 
 
The room is modest but the ambiance is great. I clean crabs and fry fish and oysters.

Kay,
I have everything I need with the exception of the wbs. coding, contact name, physical address and tax ID #.   I believe Allan is getting all that info for us.
We will be using this format from now on?

The additional income for Northwestern will be booked by the end of this week. - This isn't supposed to be split with Calger is it?

Kay - all legal invoices for Delta should be split 30% Ben Jacoby cc#107319   70% Chris Calger  cc#150273.

I wanted to follow up on a couple minor items.

Have you booked the $102,010 discount associated with the Northwestern deal as income?

On the Delta Power LM 6000 deal, I believe the legal invoices should be split according to the income allocation. I think the split was $4 million to Calger, and $2 million to me. 

Thanks,

Ben

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=

Hi guys! Hope yall are doing well. We are enjoying a beautiful day here. Are
yall enjoying having your college-aged children home?

My question is this: I think we are going to give Mama a garage door opener
for her Christmas present. Not sentimental, but I think once it's in and she
uses it, she'll like it. ANYWAY, would anyone like to pitch in toward the
installation, or, Mike, would you and Mac want to install it for her for
your present?

Just asking, if yall aren't interested, that's cool. We can always go ahead
and pay for installation or Bobby can come up and install it sometime in
January.

But, I thought I would ask, just in case you were interested. Yall are
probably way ahead of us and have finished shopping anyway. Kay, you've
already given her your present haven't you?

Also, Mama has mentioned that we need to try to schedule a Monday or Friday
in January to all get together and take care of some stuff up there. Her
will among other things I think. Anyway, any time that is bad or good for
anyone. Bobby will be out of town I think the 2nd week or so of January so I
think I would prefer to do it later. Let me know what dates are good/bad and
we can see what we come up with.

One other thing. Mike, do you know if we ever gave Kelli a birthday present?
I know I gave Michael and Paige something, and Mac's will come with the
Christmas stuff. Let me know if you know. I'm thinking I didn't do anything.

Okay, talk to yall later.

Love you!

Lisa

Randy Pais had passed those invoices that you gave to me for him on to Bart Clark and Kay Mann.  Bart said it wasn't all his work so passed the invoice to Kay Mann.  She took them all.  She may still have them or possibly her assistant.

By my calculation this payment is not due today.  I have advised Northwestern's attorney of this fact.

I have suggested to Greenburg Traurig that they stand down for the next few days until the path forward becomes more clear.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Kay, I hate to sound stupid, but............do you want all of the letters redlined or just the highlighted one?  You want the date at the top of the letter to be September 13, 2001 right?  Have the changes been made that these guys are talking about or is that something else?  Do you want me to do a new version or just put on the track changes to pick up all the changes that have been made to the letters?

Just a quick reminder:  we need to finalize our position in response to DEP's now-filed motion to consolidate the two proceedings.  Also, I need to speak with Dave and Scott Osbourn this week so that we can formulate our interrogatory responses, which I need to serve on Friday evening.
Many thanks!
Ryan

Kay & Rahil:  Just to make my position clear, if legal determines that an EEI is still necessary with this counterparty then we should go forward with pursuing an EEI agreement.

The credit position is that if the deal needs to get done soon, then let's just use the GTCs and we can follow up later with an EEI (if deemed necessary by legal).  If we can wait a couple of weeks, then let's go forward with negotiating an EEI now.

Hopefully this clarifies our position.  Sorry for the confusion.  If the later is the case, then Rahil, I will need to get financial statements from the counterparty and review.

Thank you.

Kortney

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

     I just got off the phone with Mac Miller, SWPC's attorney.  I told him that the January 8 extension was a surprise to my business client, who was not inclined to agree to it.  However, my client wanted the following information ASAP:

     1.  An estimated cost of producing and shipping the discovery requested from SWPC.

     2.  The earliest possible time frame on getting the documents and interrogatory answers from SWPC.

Miller, not surprisingly, said that this was a surprise to him, but I made clear that my instructions from my client were very firm, and he understood that.  Miller did say that this put him in a bit of a bad position, as SWPC had apparently initially not wanted to agree to any extension, and play "hard ball", and he convinced them otherwise.

Miller was in the middle of about three urgent projects, but we agreed we would speak tomorrow morning when he was less rushed and he could give me a realistic time frame for production.

Miller said he thought what he had from SWPC did include a document that showed when the DDP was paid.  Miller first said that we wouldn't like the answer, because it was before the damage, then said he really couldn't say that, because he didn't know.   Otherwise, he has not requested the customs brokers' file yet, which is in Houston, and will not give me authority to speak with the customs broker about this (nor would I have expected him to).  I got the impression that SWPC itself may not yet have sent Miller all the documents responsive to the DDP/Export House discovery requests.

In the morning, I will have our copy service come over and review the documents we will need to produce (since I have not had a chance to review the file for responsiveness, we may not have to produce everything, and may spend less money than the estimate reflects) to SWPC.   Also, I am not familiar with the discovery requested by SWPC that may be due; for instance, whether it includes interrogatories for which we need to draft answers and have someone available who can sign.   I will get my arms around this in the morning and then call you.

Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

I think first we need to know what the cost would be.  secondly, will we have a net billing since we will have a cost to produce our documents.  example

our cost to produce documents for them       $400
SW cost to produce documents for us          $500

we owe them                                              $100

is this how that will work?????????

     Just so I'm clear:

Attached is Enron North America Corp."s proposed Draft Heads of Agreement.  As you suggested the other day, we have tried to incorporate the important language of ENA's Master Firm Purchase/Sale into the red-lined draft so that it will be easier to evaluate.  There are certainly many areas in our draft document where ENA would entertain suggested language changes.  We would be happy to have a quick conversation with you to explain ENA's draft agreement and to answer any questions that you may have on the proposal.  Also attached to this message is ENA's pro forma Master Firm Document, so that you could see the starting point of our initial RFP response.

Please note that ENA does not approach Enron's upper management and Board of Directors for their approval of new proposals until a bit later in the typical bid process.  Since our deal approval procedures have not been completed, ENA had to condition this draft agreement is non-binding subject to management approval at this time.  Should ENA make the "next cut", this process would have to be completed prior to any execution of EDFI's agreements.

Please contact me at 713-853-1667 or Jaime at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,

Paul Jankowsky just called and wanted to talk to the attorney in charge of the Deerfield project.  He sounded a tad irate.

Hi John,
 
Just doing Saturday clean up stuff.
 
I feel a bit ackwardly positioned in the Midway deal.  I will try to get
some clarification of my role.  I think that Bart would like for me to
handle it, but Sheila thinks it should be handled in her group. By the
way, I think some quality time (hint, bring Ken or another power lawyer)
might be a good thing.  She would probably love a polo day (she lives at
the Houstonian, so that's easy for her).  She's very savvy and
practical, so you should get along.
 
Kay

A large group of Taliban soldiers are moving down a road when they hear a
voice call from behind a sand dune.

"One Texas soldier is better than ten Taliban."

The Taliban commander quickly sends 10 of his best soldiers over the dune
whereupon a gun battle breaks out and continues for a few minutes, then
silence.

The voice then calls out "One Texan is better than one hundred Taliban."

Furious, the Taliban commander sends his next best 100 troops over the dune
and instantly a huge gunfight commences. After 10 minutes of battle, again
silence.

The Texan voice calls out again "One Texan is better than one thousand
Taliban."

The enraged Taliban Commander musters one thousand fighters and sends them
across the dune. Cannon, rocket and machine gun fire ring out as a huge
battle is fought. Then silence. Eventually one wounded Taliban fighter
crawls back over the dune and with his dying words tells his commander,
"Don't send any more men, its a trap. There's two of them."

( I sent this out yesterday.  Yours appeared to be undeliverable, so here it
is again.  My apologies if you have already received it.  Faith)



November 14, 2001



TO:     INTERESTED POWER SUPPLIERS AND MARKETERS

RE:     REQUEST FOR RETAIL PROPOSALS - MAINE STANDARD OFFER SERVICE



        The Maine Public Utilities Commission is soliciting proposals from
interested power suppliers and marketers to supply retail standard offer
service to commercial and industrial customers of Maine's two largest
electric utilities, Central Maine Power Company and Bangor Hydro-Electric
Company.  The total annual electricity sales to these customers is about 6.8
million MWh, of which 30% currently receives standard offer service. 

        The standard offer suppliers will provide service beginning March 1,
2002.  At your option, bids may be submitted for one, two or three year
terms.  Service will be provided directly by suppliers to customers at
retail, although the utility will handle billing and collection on the
standard offer supplier's behalf. 

        Concurrent with the Commission's solicitation for retail standard
offer service, Central Maine Power Company and Bangor Hydro-Electric Company
will be seeking proposals for wholesale standard offer supply.  The
concurrent solicitations will allow the Commission to evaluate all options
simultaneously and sufficiently in advance of March 1. You may participate
in both the retail and wholesale processes.  Initial bids for all of these
solicitations will be due on December 4, 2001.

The RFPs for the retail solicitation are available at www.state.me.us/mpuc.
Please note that there are separate RFPs for each utility.  The RFPs contain
detailed information about Maine's standard offer and instructions on how to
participate.  To obtain the RFPs by mail or email, please contact Tammy
French (at 207-287-6075 or tammy.french@state.me.us
<<mailto:tammy.french@state.me.us>> )   For additional information,  please
contact Faith Huntington (at faith.huntington@state.me.us

After reviewing the Montana Megawatts file, it appears that you have already been removed as officer, power of attorney, etc. so you are good to go.

Hope you and your family have a nice Thanksgiving.

Rudy,  Reagan suggested to use the same form and scope of discussions as the Dynegy CA.  Let Kay and I know if you think there should be any changes.

Kay,

I have reviewed the proposed change with our management, and we may be able
to close this out.  For clarification purposes, please review the attached
document, in which I have incorporated your changes as proposed on 10/9/01.
The changes were made to the version you sent back to Siemens Westinghouse
on 10/01/01.  If we both agree that this version is accurate, please advise
and we will begin the execution process on our end.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ann

Hi Ann,

Thank you for your response. I wanted to propose some different language
for your consideration:

WHEREAS, the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and
alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage
because (i) of its failure to, among other things, provide drawings with
adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and (ii) excessive
vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such
damage.  As a result, Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to
Siemens Westinghouse, in May of 2001, under the Contract in the amount
of Four Hundred Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars
($409,666.00) for repair work performed on two of the stacks ("Warranty
Issue").

I hope this gets us there.  

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

We are in receipt of Enron's proposed changes to the Settlement
Agreement
and Release on the Gleason Project.  Unfortunately, it appears that the
intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial
discussions
between our respective business representatives.   In past discussions
with
Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of
the
Gleason CT exhaust stacks, Enron tied its local low frequency noise
concerns
to the stack reconstruction issue.  Although the causes for
reconstruction
of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities, SWPC agreed that in the
interest of continued customer relations, we would be willing to make a
business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in
exchange
for indemnification on future stack and noise issues. 

The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references
to
the noise issues in the warranty definition, thereby eliminating any
coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that
issue
from the Settlement Agreement.  This elimination substantially erodes
the
value of Enron's indemnification, and the settlement overall.  As
modified,
the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC, and it is in our best interest
not
to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron.  Should Enron be
willing
to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph, SWPC
would be willing to sign on to the deal.

Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.  SWPC
would
like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron, but we will not make
payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no
responsibility
unless such payment is part of a more global settlement.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Kay at this time MDEA has $292,544.40 that they owe us.  We have approximately $360,000  that we have made in profit according to our P&L from Risk.  At this time we are not doing any buying or selling for MDEA.  We run the load forecast, determine the position and then we get a market price from WRI.  We then call MDEA and inform them of the Market and their position.  They then tell us to buy the power from WRI.  We call WRI and they bill MDEA, not us.  We then do the tag.

Randy, please call me or Ron about the attached. teh goal will be to turn dox tomorrow to move the sale along.

Kay -  word is you worked the Northwestern deal. Ron wants to borrow from the Northwestern deal as this sale wil need to be done as a sale of the entity, not just the contract. Apparently, there is more of a  customs issue involved here than a consent issue, but some of the mechanics will be similar. Could you talk to Randy about the Northwestern sale and get him connected up with the dox? thanks.

Just got word from CES that we will have the RTU docs from Nortel by this Wednesday.  I will push him to get it sooner, if possible.

Here it is.  As mentioned, I have not seen an executed copy, and there may not be one.

TPC is a Delaware corp. HQ'd in Danbury, CT.  Would that mean the Ch. 11 was filed in Delaware?

Kent just asked for a copy of the latest version because he wasn't sure
he had a copy of it and wanted to know if the "businesses" had approved
the forms.

Hi Pete,

To my knowledge Enron and GE aren't discussing any turbine purchases
(maybe I missed something).  Did Kent mention why he wanted the forms?

Unless Sheila Tweed or one of her folks commission more work, I wouldn't
expect that there would be any more charges on this matter at this time.

Thanks,

Kay

The lease is freely assignable. The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible. 

Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?

Still looking for a copy of the letter from Morris. My fax number is 63491 if someone has it handy.

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

Subject:	Update on FERC ANOPR on Generator Interconnection Procedures

Last week's meetings in FERC's Generator Interconnection Procedures proceeding focused primarily on queuing issues.  A summary of the meetings is attached; the summary describes the meetings in some detail and lists interests articulated by the various parties.  

At the conclusion of the meetings:

 	- The generators and the transmission owners were still fairly far apart on several important issues pertaining to queuing:

		* what should be included in the base case study
		* milestones and their impacts
		* consequences of project cancellation
		* use of a preliminary feasibility ("fatal flaw") study
		* generator liability for upgrades

	- A committee of various participants issued a draft document on interconnection products and studies.  This document is attached.  The document recommends that three different types of interconnection service be available:  1) Energy Resource service, which allows use of existing capacity on an "as available" basis, 2) Network Resource service, which integrates the generator's facility as a qualified network resource in a manner comparable to native load customers, and 3) optional interconnection services, which would include but not be limited to Simple Interconnection Service, which allows physical interconnection but does not provide generator with the ability to synchronize its facility with the transmission owner's system.  Interested parties are to post comments on this document to the Commission's website by Nov. 23, and further issues pertaining to products will be discussed at the next meetings (Nov. 27 - 28).

If you have questions, or if you would like to discuss the attached, please contact me.

Kay,

We found the bankruptcy proceeding for The Phone Company - it was filed
in Delaware, Case no. 98-01881.  For some reason, the Delaware
bankruptcy docket is one of the few federal dockets that are not
available on the PACER system.  I'm checking with bankruptcy legal
assistants as to the cost of getting a copy of the Delaware docket.

Regards,
Sherry

Here's what I got from Eric on the lease.  The numbers don't seem to
match, but we won't worry about that now.

The Nortel RTU info is supposed to be here by Wednesday. 

Sherry, please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease Tammy
previously prepared to incorporate the new terms.  To the extent
necessary, just bracket any questions you have, especially commercial
questions.  We won't tackle the security agreement or the license
agreement yet. Just send the revised lease to me (not Eric yet).

Please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding.  If the docs
aren't available on line, please get back to me before incurring any
additional expense.  I don't want to spend a lot of money on this until
things become a bit more clear.  

Thanks,

Kay

Here it is.  As mentioned, I have not seen an executed copy, and there
may not be one.

TPC is a Delaware corp. HQ'd in Danbury, CT.  Would that mean the Ch. 11
was filed in Delaware?

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Dave and Scott,
 
I saw an article mentioning that EPA published a draft guidance (66 Fed. Reg. 52,403) clarifying the definition of "stationary source" to allow heat/power co-generation facilities to be treated as separate sources from the underlying host facility (e.g., a manufacturing plant) for NSR purposes.
 
Although the focus of the draft guidance is on cogeneration facilities, I suppose that there might be some general language in there that could clarify the single-source analysis as it pertains to the ancillary equipment at our plants for which no separate BACT analysis was done.  Are either of you familiar with the new draft guidance (or with anything else that we could use to bolster our position on this issue)?
 
Many thanks,
 
Ryan

Is your thought on the Dynegy role to have them contract with Enron, taking their profit in how they price OR enter into some type of joint venture/joint bidding arrangement?  I know you don't know what they might want to do, but I was curious as to your starting position.

Kay, attached is the letter from NLR regarding our proposal.

Summary of the Cities of NLR and Benton, Arkansas deal:


  _____  


assist Cities with network transmission service agreements with Entergy 
assist with initialization of OASIS, TSIN, and JTSIN transmission reservation accounts 
telemetering load from NLR SCADA and Benton's meters to Enron control room 
perform load forecasting 
manage NLR's Murray Hydro facility to serve NLR load 
deliver wholesale energy to match NLR and Benton loads inclusive of losses as an "into Entergy" product 
deliver wholesale energy such that network transmission can be used to sink energy to NLR and Benton native loads 
provide real time, day ahead, and term trading; scheduling and transmission reservations/services; volume management; settlements; and control room services 
arrange for ancillary services related to native load inlcuding Entergy OATT Schedules 1 through 6 
provide NLR and Benton with a fixed price for energy and ancillary services through the life of contract 
provde NLR and Benton with option to extend agreemetn for 3 additional years.

NLR Issues with Enron Proposal: 
  _____  


Your price is greater than 15% from the best price offer.  A substantial improvement in price would be necessary to receive further consideration. 
You have identified no resources inside of Entergy's control area.  If you can point to resources inside of Entergy's control area you may improve your position 
You did not utilize dynamic scheduling for the scheduling of generation to match load.  You may improve your position by offering dynamic scheduling. 
The Cities desire a fixed cost over the term of the contract.  You may improve your position by including any increases in the Cities' cost for Network Transmission Service over the term of the contract in your costs. 
The Negotiation Committees are alarmed by the recent developments concerning Enron's losses and the downgrading of Enron's securities.  Significant financial assurance would be required before the Negotiating Committee's would further consider Enron. 

What We'd Like to Do With Dynegy:

  _____  

Provided we can win the project, we'd like to do the following:

name generation to satisfy point #2 
use Dynegy base load generation assets to dynamically schedule the NLR and Benton loads 
name Dynegy assets as network resources

Note that we have not talked with Dynegy about any of this and any deal would be subject to mutual agreement and negotiation.

We are generally around.  I spoke with Kerri last night and she suggested
there might be a call around 12:30 CST, 1:30 EST today.  I am available for
an hour beginning at that time and then again after the conclusion of my
2:30 EST meeting.  The problem is that I don't know how long the latter
meeting is going to take.  I know Kerri had planned to be generally

      I hope that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving ! 
      FYI-- Judge Stampelos issued an Order consolidating the pending
Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach air permit challenges into a single
proceeding, which is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday, January 29th, 2002,
through February 1st, 2002.   Under the Order, the pre-hearing stipulation
is required to be filed by January 24th.   I will be sending a copy of the
Order by facsimile.   
       Please keep me apprised of the status of the settlement negotiations
as they progress.   I will send you a copy of the proposed permit language
for the Pompano Beach proceeding upon receipt from Martha Nebelsiek of DEP.

       If you have any questions or comments on the foregoing, please
contact me.

Kay,

The changes look fine.  Two questions, (i) with regards to the PUCHA opinion, does "registered" holding company have significance versus simply a holding company, and (ii) I read opinion #4 very narrowly to only relate to filings related to the bankruptcy petition (the "Cases") and transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.  There should really be no significant issues that arise under this particular opinion.  Is my interpretation on track?  Thanks.

Clem

Kay,

Attached is a draft of the Dynegy CA (bilateral).  The only executed bilateral CA we have in place with Dynegy is one prepared on their form.  I have not reviewed it, just talked to Kay Young.

Fastow is having a press conference today to prove he is still alive.  I heard he was in Houston yesterday, so he must have made a special trip to New York to have the press conference.  The conference was announced by his Houston criminal attorneys.

Last week FERC held a kickoff meeting on its Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) for interconnection procedures. FERC staff proposes to have 6 weeks of meetings (up to 3 days per week) to discuss issues identified by the participants.   The purpose of the meetings is to try to develop consensus among industry participants on a standard interconnection agreement and procedures.  A list of issues is attached. This list was developed by EPSA and presented to FERC at last week's meeting.

At this week's meeting, the discussion will focus on the scope of interconnection rights and on interconnection study issues.  Donna Fulton will attend these meetings on behalf of Enron.  In preparation for the meetings, EPSA developed a position paper, which is attached.  Briefly, EPSA proposes:
 
    - Interconnecting Generator may elect, as part of its application for interconnection and study agreement, to be studied as an Energy Resource and/or as a Network/Capacity Resource; it may also request an "optional deliverability" study based on case-specific requirements.  The interconnecting generator may elect its level of interconnection following completion of the studies.
 
    - The rights of the interconnected generator will depend on the manner it is studied, the upgrades for which the generator has paid, and whether the transmission pricing system is based on physical rights or financial rights.
 
If you have any comments on the attached, please let me know as soon as possible.

Kay,

This is the language generally offered by Mr. Derrick with respect to the '40 Act.  Please call if you have any questions.

Enron is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

They've changed the Cogentrix deal.  In fact, it is even a different Cogentrix counterparty.  I couldn't find the long form/GTC in the Power Forms.  Can you help?

Guess you would like the name of the counterparty.  I'll send it to you.

Thanks as always!

FYI - from Kortney in credit.

Kayne,  with regards to Kortney's question about the interruptability of power, please let me know when you're free tomorrow AM, so we can discuss this with her.

Kay, what're the next steps from your end?

Thanks again,

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kortney

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

I talked with Julie Smith right after lunch about ENA responding to Tennessee's South Texas Expansion.  The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e. Thursday, November 29th).

I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA.  That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements.  I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project.  She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA.   

Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that "due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001.  So it looks like ENEL has about another week to work on their proposal.

Ruth

P.S.  I just got off the phone with Tennessee Gas Pipeline to thank them for extending the Open Season for us and give him an update on participating in the expansion.  He indicated that "another international company" had just submitted an Open Season response.  So it looks like ENEL has submitted the necessary paperwork.

Kay,

Do you know if this invoice was ever sent to NorthWestern at or after closing.  Theresa has no record of ENA receiving the $48,000 for storage after June 30.

I'm concerned about my check right now.  They didn't pay us for our overtime (mistake) and took out for the Energizer so all of our checks are short.  I'm freaking at the moment, but I think it'll be ok.

  <http://clk4.com/redcross/images/MS_RCR2280_DEM_r2_c1.gif>	September 11, 2001 forever changed the landscape of our country and the life of every American. We have never faced a disaster of this size, scope or intensity but we're meeting the challenge. Conversely, we have never before received such overwhelming support from the public. Americans like you have responded with an outpouring of love, labor, blood and generosity. The American Red Cross depends solely on voluntary donations of time, money and blood. Without donations from you and others, we would not be able to carry out our humanitarian mission.

America has spoken loudly and clearly. The Red Cross is honoring the national call for relief efforts to be directed solely toward the people affected by the September 11 tragedies. The immediate and long-term needs of the people affected by the terrorist attacks are our highest priority. We're moving more money to the families of the dead and seriously injured victims quickly by extending our Family Gift Program to cover a full year of living expenses, providing additional payments for the next six months based on need.

25,000 families already have been directly helped by the American Red Cross. Through your support of our disaster response efforts, millions of meals have been served, tens of thousands of people have received mental health and grief counseling, and millions of dollars have been dispensed to families in dire need to cover costs of transportation, childcare, mortgage or rent payments, funerals and related expenses.   <http://clk4.com/redcross/images/graphic2.gif>Thousands of people have been displaced from their homes, and the Red Cross is there offering funds for groceries, lodging, clean-up and recovery. More than 45,000 Red Cross volunteers and disaster workers have worked at Ground Zero where they have been caring for construction workers, police, fire personnel and emergency medical technicians.

The American Red Cross will spend $275 million in support of people affected by the disasters by year end, about half of the $542 million that has been received to date. We continue to assess the needs of those affected by these tragedies and will offer families even more assistance in the months ahead.

The Red Cross was the first organization to give such support and has provided more cash assistance to the families and dependents of loved ones lost in the September 11 attacks than all other major humanitarian service organizations combined. The Red Cross will help with recovery efforts throughout the weeks, months and years to come - for as long as needs exist.

Subject: RE: Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach/Air Permitting Update 


I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation.
Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do
so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not
consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would
need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't
think the Margate issue is enough, either.)

I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of
December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue
the hearing until January anyway.

Subject: Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach/Air Permitting Update 


    Kay, Steve, Ben, and Debbie --  
        I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP
is
intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings
into
a single proceeding.  To that end,  Martha believes that the proceedings
should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the
cases
is consolidated into the other.  Martha believes that consolidation is
appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are
consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the
sites
as one.   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted
our
position on the proposed consolidation.  I told her that we would likely
oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing
our
position.  
        Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages.    The
cases, if
consolidated, may be less expensive to try.  Yet, the hearing in
December
may be at risk if consolidation occurs.    In addition, the parties are
not
exactly the same in each proceeding  (Margate is not a participant in
the
Deerfield proceeding).  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible
with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation.   If she does not
hear
back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate
that
Enron objects to the consolidation.    
         Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enron's response
to
DEP's Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit.   I promised
not
to file any response last week, given the pending settlement
negotiations
but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days. 
         Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation.  
            --Kerri    .

The attachment wasn't the important part. He always attaches something to
emails...It might be the syllabus or something. I just thought what he wrote
in the body of the letter was really sweet. Oh, if you do happen by Hulen
Mall, could you pick me up one of those nail things? I have showed it to
everyone, and they think it's amazing. If not, no biggie. I'll be up there
sometime, and I can take care of it. How are you two doing? Are you getting
stuff done? Is there anything I need to do to help you or Mimi? Just let me
know. I have to get ready for my tour now.

It would be terrific if I could see the tasking letter before I give final approval to the GSA (since this is really a one-off deal), and I will need to approve and initial both the GSA and the tasking letter.

Please provide final GSA so that I can forward to Jode.  Tasking Letter is not processed until GSA is executed and language has been agreed upon.  I will process once I received the executed GSA from Jode.

After discussions with Chris Booth of Enron, we agreed the best way to

handle the outstanding refund to Enron for the storage of the units (equal

to $48,000), is to net the amount from the balance to be paid back to

NorthWestern.

Chris, did your lawyers draft the paperwork to approve the reduction in the

payment, or do you want Paul Hastings to do so?  Please advise.

         UPDATE--DEP recently issued a Notice of Change of Agency Position
(Notice of Change) in the Pompano Beach proceeding in which DEP advised all
of the parties and the administrative law judge that it was intending to
modify the previously issued intent to issue relative to six issues.  
         The primary two conditions that DEP is modifying its position
concern the NOx emission limits during distillate fuel use and a reduction
in the number of hours that the facility can operate on distillate fuel use.
Specifically on the first issue, DEP intends to  limit the facility to 36
ppmvd for NOx rather than the previously issued limitation of 42 ppmvd.   On
the second issue, DEP proposes to reduce the number of hours of diesel fuel
use from 1000 hours to 500 hours per year after 2004.     
        The other issues raised in the Notice of Change include :  startup
and shutdown conditions;  emergency equipment;  other minor sources; and the
VOC emission limit.    I have discussed the Notice of Change with Dave
Kellermeyer and he, in turn, is going to discuss the Notice in detail with
Scott Osbourn.    We have some questions on certain of the issues raised in
the Notice of Change, which we will need to clarify with DEP.
        I will circulate the Notice of Change to you in the next few minutes
if you have not already seen it.  In addition, we intend to respond to the
Notice with a pleading that sets forth :  i) our intention to object and
present evidence in opposition to certain of the permit changes proposed by
DEP, and  ii)  our desire for expedited discovery with respect to the
textual permit language now proposed by DEP.    Kay, we will be sending you
that draft pleading today for your review and comment.   We would like to
file the pleading by tomorrow if possible. 
        Debbie and Steve,  if you have any questions on this matter prior to
your meeting tomorrow, please contact me.  I will be here in the office all
day.   
         Thanks--Kerri

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

I'm in, but with lots going on.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Thanks,

Kay

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil

Further to your call on Friday, the Letter Agreement does not require NorSub
to consent to the invoices that GE submits for the installments of Purchase
Amount due and payable by ENA.  Instead, Section 8(a) of the Letter
Agreement requires ENA to "provide NorSub with notice of each Remaining
Purchase Amount Installment which is paid by ENA (including the date and the
amount thereof) prompltly after payment thereof by ENA."

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.

As for the past three years, the DASH Library is probably a reliable source of information and should capture most of the transactions.  Prior to that, I can't say.  When do you need this info?

Hi Chip,
 
In connection with the DIP financing, we are required to schedule assets (broadly defined) acquired in the past 5 years which exceed $100 million in cost. I was wondering if it might be possible to research this by reviewing DASH's, since I would assume that all such transactions would have been DASH'ed.  I would appreciate your thoughts on this approach.
 
I'm out but will be checking email.  
 
Here's hoping for a good New Year!
 
Kay

FYI - from Kortney in credit.

Kayne,  with regards to Kortney's question about the interruptability of power, please let me know when you're free tomorrow AM, so we can discuss this with her.

Kay, what're the next steps from your end?

Thanks again,

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kortney

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

We are in the midst of negotiating with Coconut Creek and the other petitioners a global settlement agreement for both the Creek lawsuit and the administrative hearings for Pompano and Deerfield.   Assuming we are successful and the petitioners drop their request for the administrative hearings, what are the remaining outstanding issues with the DEP?  How do you recommend we handle DEP's latest notice of change for Pompano and when do you recommend we issue our response to the change?  

The anticipated settlement conditions are as follows:

	1.	only one facility will have back-up fuel (Enron to choose as some point in time between DBEC or PBEC) while the other facility is gas only.  The oil use and emissions levels are per the air permit (which may or may not be the same depending on the outcome of the Pompano notice of change).
	2.	Enron to provide a one time payment for emissions monitoring to be procured, operated and maintained by DPEP.
	3.	BACT for the simple cycle facility (basis for current permit) and future conversion to combined cycle should Enron elect to convert.
	4.	??? should know the other conditions, if any, later in the week.

    Enclosed please find a draft reponse to DEP's "change of position" in the  Pompano case.  Although we would normally take DEP heavily to task for its  eleventh-hour change of position, and argue that the process cannot fairly  proceed without additional procedural protections, I understand that keeping the  trial date is our paramount concern here.  Accordingly, we have pulled our  punches somewhat, and simply try to accomplish 3 things: (1) place all parties  on notice that we will be advocating issuance of the original draft permit at  the hearing (we can always pull back on issues that turn out to have no  consequence), (2) require DEP to clearly state, for the record, exactly what  textual changes to the draft permit it is advocating (we will also attempt to do  this through discovery), and (3) sensitive the judge to the fact that we will  likely need to expedite our discovery from DEP.
   I would  like to file this by mid-afternoon tomorrow (I am travelling on Wed.) and would  welcome your comments at your earliest possible convenience.
 
Thanks!

Kay -- I have my files on item 1, so please see me if you need background.  The 1995 Interchange Agreement per Section 2.03 continued year-to-year until terminated by notice per its Section 2.02, which was never received nor sent according to my reseach.  The 1/3/96 was a term deal, and superseded the 1995 agreement 'only as to the subject matter of the 1996 agreement'.  The confirmation attached under item 1 below was done on a long form confirmation and per the 1st paragraph of Annex A, overrides the 1995 Interchange agreement in the event of any conflict -- all our essential boilerplate is found in Annex A. --David

I'll try to respond to each question.  Let me know if you need more info.
1.  The contract is not expired.  David Portz reviewed it and said it was only terminated as far as the 1/3/96 contract terms superseded it.  781588 is attached if this is the deal we are talking about. It was done under the GTC.
 << File: 781588.pdf >> 

2. "Ameren Energy, Inc., as agent" is the CP showing in Enpower.  We have sold to them under the EOL GTC so there is no contract for sales.

4.  There is nothing booked in Enpower for GPU Energy.  Everything is booked under GPU Service, Inc. as agent for the individual utilities listed.  Looks like it is all sales for December forward.  EOL deals would be under the EOL GTC.  OTC trades would come under the 9/15/94 sales agreement below.

Kay,

In going through the contracts assigned to us, I have determined that we do not have all contracts necessary to evaluate our exposure/potential work out of the various transaction.  To summarize:

1.Oglethorpe Power Corp.:  The Interchange Agreement supplied is expired.  Is there an amendment or extension?

2.Ameren Services Company:  The contract is sell only (Ameren sells to EPMI), but we have positions in our books whereby Ameren has the obligation to purchase from EPMI.  There must be a MPPSA or another contract that allows for purchases as well.  Ameren has the obligation to purchase 300-400 MW on-peak for next summer.  This one should be a relatively easy sell/assignment to a third party.

3.Connecticut Light & Power:  Termination is subject to conditions outlined in the Mid-Connecticut Project Termination, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (I think this is the bigger CRRA agreement).  Jim Grace and Sheila Tweed are the responsible parties for the CRRA workout.  As this contract is inextricably linked, shouldn't they take over this contract as well?

4.GPU:  I believe there are additional contracts out there  governing transactions between EPMI and the various GPU subsidiaries.  Will you have a search run on the follow company names?

GPU Services
GPU Energy
Jersey Central Power & Light Company
Metropolitan Edison Company
Pennsylvania Electric Company

Thanks!

Heather

Subject:	FP&L letter of 11/30 re new GIS Procedures

I understand you are working with Raimund Grube on a response to FP&L re the above-referenced letter. By that letter, FP&L attempts to graft onto the current GIS procedures the requirement that a customer demonstrate within 60 days of customer's receipt of a facilities study that customer has obtained any necessary local, county and/or state zoning permit that allows for construction of the facility specified in customer's request for a facilities study or lose its queue position. 

My records show  we have received Facilities Studies for the Midway, Deerfield and Corbett projects, but it is unclear whether we have received a Facilities Study for the Pompano project ( no Endeavor files, the entitiy that made the Pompano study requests, etc.). Based on FP&L's correspondence accompanying the Feasibility Study for the Fort Pierce project dated 8/29/01, I believe we concurred with FPL's assessment that neither a Facilities Study nor Interconnection Agreement is needed for that project.

Raimund has advised we intend to challenge any attempt by FP&L to graft onto the GIS procedures the new requirement referred to above to the extent the requirement is sought to be applied to Facilities Studies arising out of Interconnection Study Agreements entered into prior to the date of FP&L's notification of the new requirements. It strikes me that if that general argument is not successful, that we still have good fallback arguments, in those cases where we already have received facilities studies, that such a requirement cannot be retroactively applied in those cases. My concern about the new FP&L requirement is that FP&L may be more likely to be successful in applying it in cases where we have not yet received facilities studies ( Pompano?). 

Please advise me and Raimund when and how you intend to respond to FP&L, and from time to time whether you think we need to take any action regarding the zoning requirements for any of the projects in light of the expected outcome of your objections to the new FP&L requirements. Also please advise if you need any information about the prosecution of the zoning requirements in these cases to bolster your arguments to FP&L or FERC about the unfairness of the new requirement ( it may take some time to pull the info together).

FYI, if it is useful to your analysis, my records show the following FP&L agreements/studies for each of the Midway, Deerfield, Pompano and Corbett projects, and the zoning status for each as I understand it. Whether or not essential to your analysis and response to FP&L, by copy hereof I'm requesting Raimund  correct or supplement my understandings ( to the extent he is able) so we can be aware of pending interconnection and zoning related requirements for the Florida projects to which the FP&L letter relate.

MIDWAY:

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 6/9/00 between Midway Development Company and FP&L, and as amended 9/7/01 and 10/8/01, and related Feasibility Study  ( 2 CTs comprising 366 MW) received _______ (have study, but not transmittal letter confirming date of its receipt), and revision thereof received _______( I have neither revised feasibility study nor transmittal letter). The amendments extend the date for executing a definitive Interconnection and Operation Agreement for the project to 30 days after Midway's receipt of the "official" draft of the IOA. I am unaware whether such draft has been received or the 30 day period has commenced.

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 10/26/00 between Midway Development Company and FP&L requesting interconnection of a third project to FP&L, related to either Midway 2 Power Project Feasibility Study ( queue spots 25 and 30, one CT comprising 212.5 MW ) received on or about April 13,2001, or Midway 3 Power Project Feasibility Study (queue spots 25 and 30, one steam turbine generator, 280.5MW) received on or about April 13,2001.

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 11/2/00 between Midway Development Company and FP&L requesting interconnection of a second project to FP&L, related to either the Midway 2 or Midway 3 Power Project Feasibility Studies referred to above.

First Midway Facilities Study and Preliminary Revised First Midway Facilities Study ( my index indicates we have these but they were removed from Deal Bench and I don't have copies and can't ascertain date of their receipt), which I assume relate to either the First Midway, Midway 2 or Midway 3 Study Agreements and Feasibility Studies referred to above. It is unclear if we are awaiting additional Facilities Studies under the other requests referred to above.

Status of Local/County/State Zoning Requirements: Per the Deal Bench information memo prepared for the Midway project, the St. Lucie Planning and Zoning Commission recommended approval of the rezoning and site plan on 2/15/01, and the St. Lucie Board of County Commissioners approved rezoning and the final site plan on 4/3/01. The approvals are conditioned upon Midway Development Company commencing construction by 4/03. I recollect that there may be another condition, relating to building permits and construciton of a turn off from a county road to the site, that Greg Krause was trying to get resolved immediately prior to Enron's bankruptcy filing, that could require earlier action to maintain the zoning and site plan approval for the project.

DEERFIELD:

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 6/9/00, between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a project to FP&L, no related Feasbility Study found.

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 11/2/00, between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a second project to FP&L, no related Feasbility Study found.

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 10/26/00, between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L. requesting interconnection of a third project to FP&L, no related Feasibility Study found.

Revised Facilities Study ( Enron Broward North 1 Project) and draft Interconnection and Operation Agreement between Broward Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L ( to be executed on or before 1/1/07), each delivered with FP&L letter dated 11/6/00.

Status of Local/County/State Zoning Requirements: Unknown.

POMPANO:

I have the Pompano files given to me by Kathleen Carnahan, and the FP&L agreements/studies, taken in the name of Endeavor Development Company, LLC, are not part of the file. By copy hereof, I'm requesting Kathleen advise me where I might find the Endeavor files. I have a memo from Greg Krause indicating there were two Interconnection Study Agreements in the name of Endeavor for the Pompano project, dated 3/14/00 and 3/20/00, respectively. The status of local/county/state zoning requirements for this project is unknown.

CORBETT:

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 6/9/00 between Sawgrass Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a project to FP&L, and related Revision 1 to Feasibility Study of unknown date.It is unclear if the Revision 1 relates to this 6/9 Study Agreement, or the 11/2 or 10/26 Study Agreements referred to below.

Interconnection Study Agreement dated 11/2/00 between Sawgrass Development Company, L.L.C. and FP&L, requesting interconnection of a second project to FP&L, and related Revision 1 to Feasibility Study of unknown date.

Note: A memo from Greg Krause indicated there was a third Interconnection Study Agreement dated 10/26/00 requesting interconnection of a third project to FP&L, but no copy of this Interconnection Study Agreement has been found.

Facilities Study recieved on or about 6/01/01, related to unspecified Interconnection Study Agreement between FP&L and Sawgrass ( queue spot 19). Letter notes Sawgrass must notify FP&L of its intention to proceed on or before 7/31/01, or request withdrawn. If request received, FP&L to provide Sawgrass with draft Interconnection & Construction Agreement within 60 days of FP&L's receipt of Sawgrass's confirmation that it intends to proceed. Unclear if Sawgrass replied, or if it did, if FP&L delivered draft agreement. 

Status of Local/County/State Zoning Requirements: Status of Sawgrass or Lauderdale Land applications on behalf of the project/required rezoning and land use approvals for the project unclear. Lessor has sought rezoning that Lauderdale (and its assignee, Palm Beach Development Company) have alleged breaches the Lease Agreement for the project site.

Kay, attached is the letter from NLR regarding our proposal.

Summary of the Cities of NLR and Benton, Arkansas deal:

  _____  


assist Cities with network transmission service agreements with Entergy
assist with initialization of OASIS, TSIN, and JTSIN transmission reservation accounts
telemetering load from NLR SCADA and Benton's meters to Enron control room
perform load forecasting
manage NLR's Murray Hydro facility to serve NLR load
deliver wholesale energy to match NLR and Benton loads inclusive of losses as an "into Entergy" product
deliver wholesale energy such that network transmission can be used to sink energy to NLR and Benton native loads
provide real time, day ahead, and term trading; scheduling and transmission reservations/services; volume management; settlements; and control room services
arrange for ancillary services related to native load inlcuding Entergy OATT Schedules 1 through 6
provide NLR and Benton with a fixed price for energy and ancillary services through the life of contract
provde NLR and Benton with option to extend agreemetn for 3 additional years.

NLR Issues with Enron Proposal: 
  _____  


Your price is greater than 15% from the best price offer.  A substantial improvement in price would be necessary to receive further consideration.
You have identified no resources inside of Entergy's control area.  If you can point to resources inside of Entergy's control area you may improve your position
You did not utilize dynamic scheduling for the scheduling of generation to match load.  You may improve your position by offering dynamic scheduling.
The Cities desire a fixed cost over the term of the contract.  You may improve your position by including any increases in the Cities' cost for Network Transmission Service over the term of the contract in your costs.
The Negotiation Committees are alarmed by the recent developments concerning Enron's losses and the downgrading of Enron's securities.  Significant financial assurance would be required before the Negotiating Committee's would further consider Enron. 

What We'd Like to Do With Dynegy:
  _____  

Provided we can win the project, we'd like to do the following:

name generation to satisfy point #2
use Dynegy base load generation assets to dynamically schedule the NLR and Benton loads
name Dynegy assets as network resources

Note that we have not talked with Dynegy about any of this and any deal would be subject to mutual agreement and negotiation.

We assigned the agreement to Onondaga Energy Venture some time ago, so I would presume that matters pertaining to ENA no longer apply. Any thoughts on this? Also, if ENA still applies, I would presume ENA's bankruptcy filing would protect against any such termination.

Importance:	High

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil

Potential Deal Structure:
Enron will sell to the members of Blue Ridge, firm, fixed price energy to meet its load obligation.  Energy will be delivered at the Borders of AEP, Cinergy, and VEPCO systems, and Blue Ridge's existing transmission agreements will be used to deliver the energy.

Enron will be responsible for all the ancillary and load following services
Enron will be charging a fixed price per MWh to reflect the energy and services provided to Blue Ridge
Enron will have access to Blue Ridge's peak-shaving and demand side resources to serve Blue Ridge's load

Hi Jerry,
 
Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take
steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the
transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve
for his review.  Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any
continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.
 
Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter
fromN orthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to

For what it is worth, this is from Blue Ridge Power Agency website:  http://www.brpa.org/



About BRPA:
Blue Ridge Power Agency ("Blue Ridge") is a non-profit corporation established in 1988 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and falls under Section 501(c)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a "joint action" agency that operates as directed by the Board of Directors. Each member appoints one Director and one Alternate from its organization to the Board.
The ultimate goal of the organization, through the power of numbers and economies of scale of cooperative, "joint" action, is to pursue those activities which will insure the most reliable and lowest cost wholesale electric power supplies possible for its members today and in the future.
There are currently nine members of the agency as listed below, consisting of seven municipalities, one state institution and one electric cooperative. Blue Ridge represents its members' best interest in several forums by direct staff involvement and/or coordination of the efforts of its attorney(s) and consultant(s). In each of these areas, wholesale and/or retail power supply and service issues are involved: energy and transmission contract negotiation; contract administration; consolidated billing; state and federal regulatory proceedings and litigation; state and federal legislation which includes education and lobbying efforts; joint purchasing; industry information dissemination; training; and "as assigned."
The current efforts of Blue Ridge and its staff are focused mostly in two areas: (1) administering its current power supply contract with Cinergy and the associated transmission contract with American Electric Power; (2) representing BRPA members' interest where wholesale power supply and transmission issues are involved, particularly in regard to the electric industry's transition to a restructured, "customer choice" structure. Generation was deregulated at the Federal level in 1992. Efforts now concentrate on the restructuring of the regulatory provisions for continued monopoly service at the transmission, distribution and customer service levels of the industry. It is especially crucial that the laws and regulatory structures that develop over the next few years are fair, non-discriminatory and promote real competition.

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

I'm in, but with lots going on.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Thanks,

Kay

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Bart:

This is Fred.  I am working on Kathleen's computer to facilitate easy Livelink access.

It appears that an Unconditional Guarantee Agreement was executed between the City of Deerfield and DBEC, L.L.C. prior to the execution of the Agreement Related to The Use and Development of Real Property (dated June 29, 2001).  We do not have a copy of the executed version of the Guarantee Agreement, but Greenberg & Traurig should have one.

The Guarantee Agreement obligates DBEC to make a non-refundable payment on or before 9/30/01 (this payment was made) and a second payment of $1,000,000 "subsequent to DBEC's application but prior to its receipt of the first building permit or engineering work permit for the Facility".

Kay has more detailed knowledge of this Guarantee and other Deerfield and Pompano documents through her role in the development of these projects.  Please call her for specific information on project Agreements.

Call Kathleen or I if we can help in this process.

Thanks, Kay - Your e-mail solved the mystery, I think.  I have checked the
signature block in our pleadings, and they list a fax number which is not
our firm's main fax number (I assume it is a satellite fax machine somewhere
near Kerri's or Paul's office). I'm sure that your fax went to that machine
and no one on this end got it to me.  I don't know where the satellite
machine is located, but will follow up on Monday.

In any event, I served the answers sans signature (so that our objections
have been preserved), and will send out a version including the signature
once the hard copy arrives.

Was that the correct office?  I gave it to her at 345 CST, and it would
be very unusual for her to not send it fairly soon after that.  I've
left her a voice mail to see what's up.
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

The documents give us a choice between paying the Remaining Purchase Amount Refund Amount ($5.099 million) to the LLC or paying the GE Accelerated Payment ($?) to GE.  As you know cash is extremely tight at the moment - have we done all we can to negotiate a lower payoff amount with GE?  The Remaining Purchase Amount Refund Amount allows us to deduct interest, a benefit of ~2.24%.  Can GE give us any discount in excess of 2.24%?  If so, we should opt for the GE Accelerated Payment.  We can discuss this further tomorrow.

Mike Young from NW called to advise me that they received GE's consent. NW plans to send us notice of this tomorrow. I believe this will trigger our obligation to pay NW the balance of payments we hold, discounted at 7.5 % p.a. I believe this means that we will need to pay NW $5.1 million of the $5.2 million we have been prepaid.

Let's talk about this in the AM.

Ok.  One question...I have a draft of the "Written Consent of Manager of Montana Megawatts I, LLC" prepared by Marisa.  One of the resolutions was the election of officers (not directors) of the company.  Is the document making Ben a director in the closing documents?

Anyway, I'll prepare his resignation, I was just wondering if he was an officer too.

Kay,

I think it was around 3p.m. on Saturday.  His name is Charles (Charlie).
His middle name is something like Coudair (sp?).  Tammy has been working
on making lists and folders of all of her outstanding matters, so
hopefully we are ready to make the transition.

Jeff,

I received an invoice for storage for the month of November, but would request that this invoice and future invoices for storage instead be sent to NorthWestern.  Under the terms of the assignment, NorthWestern has the obligation for storage charges from October forward.  I know this might be a little confusing since Enron has the ongoing payment obligations for the original purchase contract and the first two change orders.

Please feel free to call if you need to discuss this matter further.

Kay,

In going through the contracts assigned to us, I have determined that we do not have all contracts necessary to evaluate our exposure/potential work out of the various transaction.  To summarize:

1.Oglethorpe Power Corp.:  The Interchange Agreement supplied is expired.  Is there an amendment or extension?

2.Ameren Services Company:  The contract is sell only (Ameren sells to EPMI), but we have positions in our books whereby Ameren has the obligation to purchase from EPMI.  There must be a MPPSA or another contract that allows for purchases as well.  Ameren has the obligation to purchase 300-400 MW on-peak for next summer.  This one should be a relatively easy sell/assignment to a third party.

3.Connecticut Light & Power:  Termination is subject to conditions outlined in the Mid-Connecticut Project Termination, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (I think this is the bigger CRRA agreement).  Jim Grace and Sheila Tweed are the responsible parties for the CRRA workout.  As this contract is inextricably linked, shouldn't they take over this contract as well?

4.GPU:  I believe there are additional contracts out there  governing transactions between EPMI and the various GPU subsidiaries.  Will you have a search run on the follow company names?

GPU Services
GPU Energy
Jersey Central Power & Light Company
Metropolitan Edison Company
Pennsylvania Electric Company

Thanks!

Heather

Threshold is $50mm FMV of assets being sold.  Don't think we can get to that point.

I'm out (in SF) and off Wednesday. What's the status of the deal? Were we going to require them to get DOJ approval?

I can be reached by fax today and tomorrow at 415-383-1613.

Ben,

I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.  Will you be in this week?  If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.

Kay

Kathleen, 

Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks.

Please provide final GSA so that I can forward to Jode.  Tasking Letter is not processed until GSA is executed and language has been agreed upon.  I will process once I received the executed GSA from Jode.  
Kay, I have a note that you would like to see if before I added to the approval process.
 
Thanks and best regards,

Allan,
 
There comments appear to me to be more commercial.  I'm not bothered by them.
 
Adriana, have you had a chance to give the tasking letter some thought?  It would be good to be able to wrap this up at one time.
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

If the wire transfer is completed today (11/26), the amount is $5,064,535.  If the wire goes through tomorrow, the amount is $5,065,607 and the paperwork would need to be changed to reflect the 11/27 date.  I just need to know what day we plan on sending the wire.  Theresa has advised that we need to give the approval by 3 pm today (Houston time) for the wire to happen today.  If Dave is okay with deal and Kay believes all the document are in place, why not today.

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

   Enclosed please find a draft reponse to DEP's "change of position" in the Pompano case.  Although we would normally take DEP heavily to task for its eleventh-hour change of position, and argue that the process cannot fairly proceed without additional procedural protections, I understand that keeping the trial date is our paramount concern here.  Accordingly, we have pulled our punches somewhat, and simply try to accomplish 3 things: (1) place all parties on notice that we will be advocating issuance of the original draft permit at the hearing (we can always pull back on issues that turn out to have no consequence), (2) require DEP to clearly state, for the record, exactly what textual changes to the draft permit it is advocating (we will also attempt to do this through discovery), and (3) sensitive the judge to the fact that we will likely need to expedite our discovery from DEP.
   I would like to file this by mid-afternoon tomorrow (I am travelling on Wed.) and would welcome your comments at your earliest possible convenience.
 
Thanks!
Ryan

As Fred pointed out, he thinks the "gas" agreement you are referring to is the Amended and Restated Gas Sales Agreement, which is Exhibit "A" to the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.

John and/or Bart:  I have a copy of the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.  Who wants it?

Manager's Journal

Beware the Self-Promoting CEO
By Jim Collins. 

Mr. Collins is the author of "Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the
Leap ... and Others Don't" (HarperBusiness, 2001). He operates a
management research laboratory in Boulder, Colo.

In December 1999, Carelton Fiorina appeared on the cover of Forbes
magazine above a three-inch headline, "The Cult of Carly." The article
-- titled "All Carly, All the Time" -- dubbed her activities the "Carly
Show." It described how she launched "Travels With Carly," a global
lecture tour aboard a $30 million Gulfstream IV -- something that no
previous Hewlett-Packard CEO had ever had, not even David Packard or
Bill Hewlett. But of course, Carly needed the Gulfstream to project her
image world-wide. "Leadership is a performance," she explained.

And perform she did. The article detailed how she appeared widely on
national television shows -- morning shows with Carly, Tom Brokaw with
Carly, Japanese television with Carly -- and how she launched a $200
million campaign with commercials featuring her talking about the
innovative spirit of HP. One was immediately left to wonder: Whose brand
was she building anyway? It sure looked like the brand of Carly would
soon eclipse the brand of HP.

The really striking point is that Ms. Fiorina had been on the job less
than six months before she posed for the cover of Forbes as a superhero
savior. She hadn't done anything significant. And now, two years later,
she still hasn't produced any significant results. During her watch, HP
stock has fallen more than 50% -- substantially underperforming the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500, and falling nearly twice as far as
Apple, IBM and Sun Microsystems over the same period.

These results, combined with a negative reaction from the capital
markets to the proposed Compaq merger, put Carly in a tenuous position.
And now, key members of the Hewlett and Packard families have lined up
against her strategy, in part because it runs counter to the core values
that made HP great in the first place.

 
If Ms. Fiorina's tenure proves to be a failure (I hope not, but the
cards don't look good), it will be the most high-profile failure of a
woman CEO in history. And the real tragedy will be that some people will
pin the blame on the fact that she is a woman. "It just goes to show, a
woman can't handle a job like this," I can hear them say.

But to say that Ms. Fiorina is failing because she is a woman would be
entirely the wrong conclusion. Her failure has nothing to do with the
fact that she is a woman and everything to do with the fact that she is
the wrong type of leader. Anyone who led like Carly would also likely
fail.

A case in point is Mike Armstrong at AT&T. Like Ms. Fiorina, Mr.
Armstrong rode in as the great heroic savior. Like Ms. Fiorina, he put
on a good show and became a celebrity. Like Ms. Fiorina, he allowed
media hype about himself to overshadow the real nuts and bolts of what
needed to be done. Like Ms. Fiorina, he lurched after big splashy
acquisitions, despite the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever to
support the idea that a company can buy its way to greatness. (Two big
mediocrities never make one great company.) And like Carleton Fiorina,
C. Michael Armstrong has thus far failed to live up to outsized
expectations.

The real issue at hand is not male or female, but the type of
leadership. My research team and I recently completed a five-year
research project in which we systematically analyzed leaders who took
good companies and made them great. All the good-to-great leaders were
the complete opposite of Ms. Fiorina and Mr. Armstrong. They deflected
attention away from themselves, shunned the limelight and quietly
focused on the tasks at hand. One described himself as "more plowhorse
than showhorse," an apt description of all the good-to-great leaders we
studied.

We learned in our research that the most effective leaders never make
themselves the center of attention. They are understated yet determined,
quiet yet forceful. Most lack the liability of charisma. Indeed, the
very best ones overwhelmed us not with their ego, but with their
humility. They are ambitious, to be sure, but ambitious first and
foremost for their institutions, not for themselves.

Charles R. Walgreen III, for example, transformed Walgreens from a
mediocrity into a machine that produced cumulative stock returns that
beat Intel by nearly two to one, GE by nearly five to one, and the
general stock market by over 15 times from 1975 to 2000. These results
stem directly from Mr. Walgreen's stoic resolve to make a series of
tough decisions, such as jettisoning the entire food-service business
(which dated back to his grandfather and was quite profitable) because
it was not an arena where Walgreens could be the absolute best in the
world.

Few executives have the guts to get rid of profitable businesses where
their company can only be good, but never great. Mr. Walgreen not only
had the guts, but he made his decisions without fanfare -- quietly
taking action based on understanding, not bravado.

Yet despite these results, not once did Mr. Walgreen stand in front of
the mirror and point to himself as a key factor, preferring instead to
point out the window to credit the great people he had on his team. When
we confronted him with the undeniable fact of stupendous results created
under his leadership and pushed him to discuss his own role in getting
great people to make those results happen, he deflected again, and
pinned much of the credit for his success on being "lucky."

Now, you might be thinking, "But women leaders in a male-dominated world
cannot afford to be self-effacing. They need to show that they can be
more Patton than Patton, more Jack than Jack, so that people will take
them seriously."

Well, think again. Consider Katherine Graham of the Washington Post
Company, whose practical approach to leadership differed so dramatically
from Ms. Fiorina's that it's as if they came from opposite ends of the
solar system. When Graham became president of the Washington Post, she
did not position herself as the great leader or savior. In her own
words, she was "terrified." Shy, awkward and socially fearful, Graham
did not launch "The Katherine Tour" or create "The Cult of Katherine."
Reflecting on her early years atop the Post in her book "Personal
History," she hardly gives herself any credit whatsoever, writing that
she was surprised even to land on her feet.

But as with Mr. Walgreen, if you were to interpret Katherine Graham's
genuine personal humility as a sign of weakness, you would be terribly
mistaken. Just ask members of the Nixon White House, who were brought
down in large part because of her courage to stand absolutely firm
behind her reporters in their pursuit of the Watergate story. Even so,
she pinned the success principally on other people, the enduring core
values of the Post, and good luck. In a single paragraph summarizing the
whole Watergate episode, she uses the word "luck" or "lucky" nine times.
The only time she uses the pronoun "I" is to deflect acclamation for her
courage.

Katie and Carly. One took a good company and made it great, the other
has thus far taken a great company and made it good. One embodied the
type of leadership required for true greatness, the other has thus far
shown the type of leadership that erodes greatness. One saw the purpose
of it all as far beyond herself, the other has acted as if the supreme
purpose is herself.

I hope that Carly Fiorina grows into the type of leader that is required
to take a company from good to great -- a type epitomized by Charles
Walgreen and Katherine Graham -- and thereby leads HP back to greatness.
But if she does not, her failure lies in her inability to become such a
leader and not in the utterly irrelevant fact that she is a woman.

It may also makes sense to keep the arrangements separate.  The City's claim pursuant to its power deal (presumably with ENA) is likely a general unsecured claim that gives them very little hope of actually collecting.  Sandhill is not a debtor (not yet anyway) and is an assets/commodity that can be freely assigned.  Just a thought.

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

	Andy,

	I am handling three insurance claims that need extensions of time for suit against Underwriters.  I would like to send the attached request for extension of time tomorrow or Monday, given that we will start running into vacation schedules otherwise. There are agreed extensions of time in place for the first two matters already, and they expire December 31.  Sharron West, the Underwriters' adjuster on all three claims (I believe that the policy is the same in each case), has asked that we submit all requests for extensions of time at once.
	
	The only somewhat problematic matter is Enron Petrochemicals, in which we have submitted a fully documented claim some time ago.  Subject to what Jim Studdert thinks, I thought Underwriters would have paid us by now.  By getting an extension of time, we may be giving Underwriters the message that they have more time to delay.  We had to file a third-party action against Baytank in order to prevent Underwriters' subrogation rights from being prejudiced.  I do not want to incur costs prosecuting a third-party case that I don't have much faith in.    Remember than an extension of time does not preclude us from filing suit earlier.  If we don't get paid by year end or shortly thereafter, we can always choose to file suit then.

	I invite everyone's comments.

	Britt

Kay,

The revised JVD opinion has him opining as to non-contravention issues with respect to The Portland General Pledge Agreement.  He shouldn't be giving this opinion.  His opinion was originally limited to due authorization only.  This is problematic.

FYI - 

Met Land Development Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (owned 100% by Enron North America Corp) was a shelf company we initially formed for a potential project in New York.  This entity is now being used in connection with owning the Siemens Westinghouse 501D5A.

I had told Mama that I might not come, but since they know they are going to
do the test, I'm coming. I'm hoping to leave Austin around 10 ( I have to go
up to school and do a couple of things).

Drive safely!

 I think I have decided that I am going to head up to Ft Worth in

Kay,  did you know that the Deerfield option agreements are not held by deerfield (they are held by lauderdale), & that the permits are held by a lauderdale subsidiary?  Bart wants to know if it makes sense to file for deerfield & not for the other LLC's where the project assets are held.  Can you answer this because bart is standing over my shoulder.

Dear Lori,

Just a quick question:  Shayne Newell here (working on the petition) had
the company name quoted to her (at a meeting regarding assets in the
company) as:

Enron Capital & Trade Resources Investment Corp.

Is there another entity out there with that name rather than Enron Capital
& Trade Resources International Corp.?

Thanks!
Jayne

Just to follow-up on our discussion yesterday regarding the accounting treatment assuming that USTeleNet owns the switch and that we purchase the switch and lease it back to them under a "capital" lease, the following would occur:

The asset would stay on their books (however it would be "marked-up" to FMV as evidenced by the purchase price)
They would defer the gain, if any, over the asset's life.
They would record a payable on their balance sheet and recognize interest expense in their P&L as payments are made
We would record the payment of cash to them and book a receivable and deferred interest income (to be recognized over the lease term)

Essentially we are lending them money equal to the FMV of their asset and receiving interest payments in return (i.e. direct financing lease)

I would be happy to go into more detail at your request.  Please let me know as issues develop and I will assist as necessary.

I have talked with Liz Evans at NorthWestern and we both agreed that the wire transfer will happed TOMORROW (Tuesday 11/27).  The correct amount is $5,065,607.

Theresa,  Please wait until Ben Jacoby gives the go ahead before releasing the wire.  I expect an afternoon release, so stay tuned...

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

It appeared to me that a GSA would be most appropriate for this work.  In speaking with some other EBS lawyers, I was told that Adriana could craft the work order/addendum to go with the GSA.  Please let me know if this is incorrect.

Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

Getting warmer.  Could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy.

Bart-here is the information you requested.  One note, the work that Andy
Schiffrin has been doing on the Interconnection Agreement has been quite
significant, and represents the bulk of the fees.

To date, we have billed $44,722.21, which remain outstanding.  Copies of
these invoices are being sent separately.

In the months of September and to date in October, unbilled fees are
approximately $11,000.

As to future work, which would include negotiating and finalizing the
Interconnection Agreement and negotiating the sale agreement, I estimate
$30,000.

Let me know if there is anything else you need or if you have any questions.

My goodness, you certainly were up early this morning!  I slept in until 7:00.  Getting ready to go pick up my niece so she can make Christmas presents for her parents and grandparents.  We should have a great time!
 
I will get with you on Monday regarding work matters.  I think regarding CA I and CA II, I don't remember making closing binders for the normal 5 or 6 internal distributees (maybe I did and am just getting too old to remember).  Maybe I should retire?

If we purchased the switch from an outside party and then leased it to USTeleNet under a capital lease, the asset would still be booked on UST's books at its FMV.  There would be no associated gain as the asset was never theirs (the third party would get the gain on sale).  Bullets 3 and 4 would be basically the same, except for the cash going to a third party.

What if we purchase the switch from a 3rd party, i.e. CES?  How would that affect your 1st 2 bullets?

Just to follow-up on our discussion yesterday regarding the accounting treatment assuming that USTeleNet owns the switch and that we purchase the switch and lease it back to them under a "capital" lease, the following would occur:

The asset would stay on their books (however it would be "marked-up" to FMV as evidenced by the purchase price)
They would defer the gain, if any, over the asset's life.
They would record a payable on their balance sheet and recognize interest expense in their P&L as payments are made
We would record the payment of cash to them and book a receivable and deferred interest income (to be recognized over the lease term)

Essentially we are lending them money equal to the FMV of their asset and receiving interest payments in return (i.e. direct financing lease)

I would be happy to go into more detail at your request.  Please let me know as issues develop and I will assist as necessary.
