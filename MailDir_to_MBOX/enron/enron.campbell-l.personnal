It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=
=20
first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=
e are=20
pleased that many of you have shared in the company=01,s financial success=
=20
through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=
he=20
All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=
e=20
to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=
=20
and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=
=20
effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=
le=20
on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20
salary (5% of annual base salary for each year of a 5-year period) on=20
December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=
t=20
of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=
ption=20
Program, among other good reasons=01( that=01,s why.

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =
=01)=20
Your Stock Option Program.  To provide information and answer your question=
s,=20
we will introduce a special link on the Human Resources web-site, host=20
several eSpeak sessions and continue to communicate with you on a regular=
=20
basis.  In the meantime, if you have immediate questions, please contact yo=
ur=20
Human Resources representative.=20

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=
ing=20
of options will be subject to New York Stock Exchange and state and federal=
=20
regulatory requirements.  It is expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock=
=20
Option Program will be available to most Enron employees; however, some Enr=
on=20
companies=01, employees may not be eligible due to legal, accounting, tax, =
labor=20
or business issues.  As you know, Enron changes to meet the needs of the=20
marketplaces we serve.  Given that need to change, we will continue to refi=
ne=20
the eligibility for EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program and will=20
communicate more details throughout the year with final eligibility being=
=20
determined on December 29, 2000.

Hi Larry:

The name of the company is The Travel Company. They are located in Dallas and 
the number is 214-891-9663. The folks here say that they will quote you an 
amount for the day that you call and you have to get the ticket to them 
within a few days. The prices they pay vary between $ 275 and $350. However, 
they have been paying $325 to $340 for the last few tickets that the guys 
have sold to them. Trust all is well and again thanks for the help with the 
Koch deal. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks

Joe

Joe, would you please pass on to me the contact and telephone number for the 
Southwest airline ticket issue we were discussing at the Corpus Christi 
airport last week?  By the way, how's the Koch opportunity coming along?

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Just a quick note on a statement Stan Horton made at a recent meeting with 
the OTS group.  Stan stated that the GPG was the foundation of the "Enron 
House" and that it would be difficult for Enron to keep it's current bond 
rating without GPG's revenue.

This year has been a year of change for Enron and GPG: Enron=01,s stock spl=
it,=20
we implemented a Continuous Improvement program, and we underwent a major=
=20
reorganization.  These changes have all had a positive impact on our compan=
y,=20
increasing our competitive advantage in the marketplace and challenging a=
=20
well performing organization to perform at an even higher level.  All of th=
is=20
translates to raising the bar for increased performance. =20

As GPG begins its annual year-end process of appraising performance and=20
allocating variable pay and merit increases, there are a number of changes =
to=20
the process I would like to communicate.  These changes will impact all GPG=
=20
employees, except those of you receiving Skill Based Pay.  These changes wi=
ll=20
help us take a more focused look at individual and overall company=20
performance and are intended to ensure consistency and equity in the proces=
s=20
across GPG.  The following details these changes:

Vice Presidents and Higher
All employees with the title of vice president or higher will be reviewed=
=20
Enron-wide, using common performance criteria and performance ratings.  The=
=20
officers will be reviewed and ranked within peer groups.  These groups are=
=20
Commercial, Commercial Support, Commercial Support Specialist and Technical=
.=20

All Other Non-Skill Based Pay Employees
All other non-Skill Based Pay employees will be evaluated using the current=
=20
GPG performance criteria and performance levels within their respective=20
company or business unit.  This will not be an Enron-wide activity.   =20

For directors or director-equivalent employees there will be an additional=
=20
step, which will be a GPG-wide cross-calibration by the GPG Management=20
Committee in early December.=20

We are taking a more focused look at performance.  In our efforts to=20
challenge a well-performing organization to achieve an even higher level of=
=20
performance, we are establishing the following distribution as a guideline:

Level 1 - Consistently Exceeds Expectations  10%
Level 2 - Often Exceeds Expectations  30%
Level 3 - Meets Expectations   50%
Level 4 - Needs Improvement and
Level 5 - Seldom Meets Expectations  10%=20

In the case of non-Skill Based Pay team employees in Operations, this proce=
ss=20
will lead to two ratings: a team rating, which will determine the level of=
=20
variable pay, and an individual rating that will be used to determine merit=
=20
increases.

This represents a change in our performance management process.  GPG is the=
=20
premier natural gas transmission company because of our ability to accept a=
nd=20
demand change.  We were one of the first companies to implement a Skill Bas=
ed=20
Pay Program and self-directed work teams.  We implemented Best Practices an=
d=20
Continuous Improvement.   This new approach to performance management is an=
=20
effort to strive for the top level of performance in our industry.   I want=
=20
to be clear that we have raised our performance expectations for the compan=
y=20
as well as for individuals.=20

Variable pay and merit increases will be impacted by these changes as well.=
 =20
GPG will use market data, job grade and individual and company performance =
to=20
set target bonus payout levels.  Payouts will reflect performance.  Divisio=
n=20
heads will no longer receive a pool of dollars to allocate to their=20
employees.  This method will eliminate significant differences in variable=
=20
pay for similar positions, job levels and performance levels across the=20
organization. =20

Merit increases will continue to be determined as they were in the past. =
=20
Each business unit will have a pool of dollars, which is funded as a percen=
t=20
of payroll.  Merit increases will be based on a variety of factors includin=
g=20
individual performance. =20

Variable pay will be distributed in early February and merit increases are=
=20
effective Feb. 1, 2000.

To continue to be a leading energy transportation company in a highly=20
competitive market, it is imperative that we continue to strive for=20
excellence in all we do.  I appreciate your continued support as we go=20
through this change, as you have accepted and supported other changes we ha=
ve=20
undergone.  Please do not hesitate to call your supervisor or your Human=20
Resources Representative if you have any questions.

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state.

I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed 
Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary 
Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's 
abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT 
Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because 
of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced 
onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite 
environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and 
were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they 
felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was 
not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our 
customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in 
Houston.  

After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what 
Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield 
position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a 
"temporary technical contact" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is 
accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes 
in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge 
of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which 
choose to use their service. 

 I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that 
does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting 
the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will 
alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or 
issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled 
and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having 
Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's 
concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when 
agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and 
security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person 
of Gary's reputation and character. 

In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in 
MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and 
compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and 
Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are 
approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training 
for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give 
consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in 
Bakersfield and relocate and fill his position in Mildand, Tx.

Subject: 2001 Domestic Audit Calendar

Attached for your information and planning is the projected ETS audit 
calendar for 2001.  As you can see there are a few changes in the calendar 
for next year. This year we welcome Don Bruce to the audit program.  Don 
joins Enron Quality Management from the EOTT organization as an additional 
Audit Director.  As can be seen, we have blended the EOTT assets into the ETS 
calendar.  Next year ETS will be going to a four year rotation for auditing 
team assets therefore, we have scheduled and will be conducting forty-two 
domestic audits.  

Major changes are also happening within our program design for 2001. First, 
five unannounced audits will be conducted giving management a picture of how 
well the assets are being operated on a day to day basis.   Also, new to the 
program this year, the  audits conducted by our audit teams will be scored .  
In January we are introducing a new electronic format to the audit process.  
This new computerized program should greatly enhance the audit process by 
giving EQM the capability of:

Producing enhanced audit reports
Generating site specific verification points (formally questions)
Producing statistical graphs and data
Scoring by category or total audit 
Increasing objectivity
Generating historical data for review

Enron Quality Management is enthuastically looking forward to 2001and the 
progressive program that we have outlined to help ensure "quality management" 
of our gas and liquid facilities.  During this holiday season we would like 
to take this opportunity to extend to each of you and your families the 
happiest of holidays and a progressive and prosperous new year.

Subject: Innappropriate E Mail Materials Received

I am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of 
halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which I am receiving.  I 
have been requested by Louis Soldano, Enron attorney for the Gas Pipeline 
Group, to apprise you of this situation.  The content of materials received, 
I consider offensive, and am sure it would also be considered objectionable 
and innappropriate by the standards of Enron Corporation.   Please be 
advised, that many times it is  difficult to screen this material based upon 
the headings and titles that accompany the contents.  Consequently, 
innappropriate materials such as this are opened.  I have accidently opened 
two such e mails by mistake and have received the "Enron warning"  that my 
name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has 
been placed in a file.    Because of this, I am extremely uncomfortable about 
future accidents occuring and more importantly, about the increased frequency 
and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials.     

I would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter.  Thank you very 
much.

Subject: The Room

This is an old story, maybe you haven't heard or seen it before. I thought it 
was worth passing on.

???? I  think it will touch your heart.............

>>>? About this story - Here is some  background on the author that you
>>>? might be interested  in.? Procrastinating as usual, 17-year-old
>>>? Brian  Moore had only a short time to write something for the
>>>?  Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting. It was his turn  to
>>>? lead the discussion so he sat down and  wrote.
>>>? He showed the essay, titled "The Room" to his  mother, Beth, before
>>>? he headed out the door. "I wowed  'em." he later told his father, Bruce.
>>>? "It's a killer,  It's the bomb. It's the best thing I ever wrote."? It
>>>?  also was the last. Brian's parents had forgotten about the essay  when
>>>? a cousin found it while cleaning out the teenager's  locker at Teary
>>>? Valley High School. Brian had been dead  only hours, but his  parents
>>>
>>>?????desperately  wanted every piece of his life near them - the crepe
>>>? paper  that had adorned his locker during his senior football season,  
notes
>>>? from classmates and teachers, his  homework.
>>>
>>>? Only two months before, he had  handwritten the essay about encountering
>>>? Jesus in a file  room full of cards detailing every moment of the teen's
>>>?  life. But it was only after Brian's death that Beth and Bruce  Moore
>>>
>>>?????realized  that their son had described his view of heaven. "It makes
>>>?  such an impact that people want to share it. You feel like you are  
there."
>>>? Mr.? Moore said.? Brian Moore died May  27, 1997 - the day after Memorial
>>>?  Day.
>>>
>>>? He was driving home from a friend's  house when his car went off
>>>? Bulen-Pierce Road in Pickaway  County and struck a utility pole.  He
>>>
>>>?????emerged  from the wreck unharmed but stepped on a downed power line
>>>?  and was  electrocuted.
>>>?????Brian  seemed to excel at everything he did. He was an honor  student.
>>>? He told his parents he loved them "a hundred  times a day", Mrs. Moore
>>>? said.? He was a star wide  receiver for the Teary's Valley Football team
>>>? and had  earned a four-year scholarship to Capital University in  
Columbus
>>>? because of his athletic and academic  abilities.? He took it upon himself
>>>? to learn how to  help a fellow student who used a wheelchair at school.
>>>?  During one homecoming ceremony, Brian walked on his tiptoes so that  the
>>>? girl he was escorting wouldn't be embarrassed about  being taller than 
him.
>>>? He adored his kid brother, Bruce,  now 14. He often escorted his
>>>? grand-mother, Evelyn Moore,  who lives in Columbus, to church.? "I always
>>>? called  him the "deep thinker", Evelyn said of her eldest  grandson.
>>>
>>>?????Two  years after his death, his family still struggles to  understand
>>>? why Brian was taken from them. They find  comfort at the cemetery where
>>>? Brian is buried, just a few  blocks from their home. They visit daily. A
>>>? candle and  dozens of silk and real flowers keep vigil over the  
gravesite.
>>>
>>>?????The  Moore's framed a copy of Brian's essay and hung it among  the
>>>? family portraits in the living room. "I think God used  him to make a
>>>? point. I think we were meant to find it and  make something out of it,"
>>>? Mrs. Moore said of the  essay.
>>>
>>>? She and her husband want to share  their son's vision of life after
>>>? death. "I'm happy for  Brian. I know he's in heaven. I know I'll see
>>>? him again  someday." Mrs. Moore said.? "It just hurts so bad  now."
>>>
>>>?  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
>>>
>>>?????The  Room...
>>>
>>>? In that place between wakefulness  and dreams, I found myself in the
>>>? room.? There were  no distinguishing features except for the one wall
>>>? covered  with small index card files. They were like the ones in
>>>?  libraries that list titles by author or subject in alphabetical  order.
>>>? But these files, which stretched from floor to  ceiling and seemingly
>>>? endlessly in either direction, had  very different headings.
>>? >
>>>? As I drew  near the wall of files, the first to catch my attention  was
>>>? one that read "Girls I have liked." I opened it and  began flipping
>>>? through the cards. I quickly shut it,  shocked to realize that  
>>>
>>>?????recognized  the names written on each one. And then without being
>>>?  told, I knew exactly where I was. This lifeless room with its small  
files
>>>? was a crude catalog system for my life. Here were  written the actions of
>>>? my every moment, big and small, in  a detail my memory couldn't  match.
>>>
>>>?????A  sense of wonder and curiosity, coupled with horror, stirred  within
>>>? me as I began randomly opening files and exploring  their content. Some
>>>? brought joy and sweet memories; others  a sense of shame and regret so
>>>? intense that I would look  over my shoulder to see if anyone was  
watching.
>>>
>>>?????A  file named "Friends" was next to one marked "Friends I  have
>>>? betrayed." The titles ranged from the mundane to the  outright weird.
>>>? "Books I Have Read," "Lies I Have Told,"  "Comfort I have Given," "Jokes 
I
>>>? Have Laughed at."?  Some were almost hilarious in their exactness: 
"Things
>>>?  I've yelled at my brothers".? Others I couldn't laugh at: "Things I  
Have
>>>? Done in My Anger", "Things I Have Muttered Under My  Breath at My 
Parents."
>>>? I never ceased to be surprised by  the  contents.
>>>
>>>?????Often  there were many more cards than I expected. Sometimes  fewer
>>>? than I hoped. I was overwhelmed by the sheer volume  of the life I had
>>>?  lived.
>>>
>>>?????Could  it be possible that I had the time in my years to write  each
>>>? of these thousands or even millions of cards? But  each card confirmed 
this
>>>? truth. Each was written in my own  handwriting. Each signed with my
>>>?  signature.
>>>
>>>? When I pulled out the file  marked "Songs I have listened to," I realized
>>>? the files  grew to contain their contents. The cards were packed  
tightly,
>>>? and yet after two or three yards, I hadn't found  the end of the file.? I
>>>? shut it, shamed, not so much  by the quality of music but more by the 
vast
>>>? time I knew  that file represented.? When I came to a file marked  
"Lustful
>>>? Thoughts," I felt a chill run through my body. I  pulled the file out 
only
>>>? an inch, not willing to test its  size, and drew out a card. I shuddered 
at
>>>
>>>?  its detailed content. I felt sick to think that such a moment had  been
>>>?  recorded.
>>>
>>>?????An  almost animal rage broke on me. One thought dominated my  mind:
>>>? "No one must ever see these cards! No one must ever  see this room! I 
have
>>>? to destroy  them!"
>>>
>>>? In insane frenzy I yanked the file  out. Its size didn't matter now. I
>>>? had to empty it and  burn the cards. But as I took it at one end and
>>>? began  pounding it on the floor, I could not dislodge a single card.  
>>>? became desperate and pulled out a card, only to find it  as strong as
>>>? steel when I tried to tear it.? Defeated  and utterly helpless, I
>>>? returned the file to its slot.  Leaning my forehead against the wall, I
>>>? let out a long,  self-pitying sigh.? And then I saw it. The title  bore
>>>
>>>?????"People  I Have Shared the Gospel With." The handle was brighter  than
>>>? those around it, newer, almost unused. I pulled on  its handle and a 
small
>>>? box not more than three inches long  fell into my hands.? I could count 
the
>>>? cards it  contained on one hand.? And then the tears came.? I began  to
>>>? weep. Sobs so deep that they hurt.? They started  in my stomach and shook
>>>? through me. I fell on my knees and  cried.? I cried out of shame, from 
the
>>>? overwhelming  shame of it  all.
>>>
>>>?????The  rows of file shelves swirled in my tear-filled eyes. No one  must
>>>? ever, ever know of this room. I must lock it up and  hide the key.? But
>>>? then as I pushed away the tears, I  saw  Him.
>>>
>>>?????No,  please not Him. Not here. Oh, anyone but Jesus. I watched
>>>?  helplessly as He began to open the files and read the cards. I  couldn't
>>>? bear to watch His response. And in the moments I  could bring myself to
>>>? look at His face, I saw a sorrow  deeper than my own. He seemed to
>>>? intuitively go to the  worst boxes. Why did He have to read every one?
>>>? Finally He  turned and looked at me from across the room. He looked at  
me
>>>? with pity in His eyes.? But this was a pity that  didn't anger me.
>>?  >
>>>?????I dropped my  head, covered my face with my hands and began to cry
>>>?  again.? He walked over and put His arm around me. He could have said  so
>>>? many things.? But He didn't say a word. He just  cried with  me.
>>>
>>>?????Then  He got up and walked back to the wall of files. Starting at  one
>>>? end of the room, He took out a file and, one by one,  began to sign His
>>>? name over mine on each card. "No!" I  shouted rushing to Him. All I could
>>>? find to say was "No,  no, " as I pulled the card from Him. His name
>>>? shouldn't be  on these cards. But there it was, written in red so rich,  
so
>>>? dark, so  alive.
>>>
>>>?????The  name of Jesus covered mine. It was written with His blood.  He
>>>? gently took the card back. He smiled a sad smile and  began to sign the
>>>?  cards.
>>>
>>>?????I  don't think I'll ever understand how He did it so quickly, but  the
>>>? next instant it seemed I heard Him close the last file  and walk back to 
my
>>>? side.? He placed His hand on my  shoulder and said, "It is finished." I
>>>? stood up, and He  led me out of the room.?? There was no lock on  its
>>>? door.There were still cards to be  written.
>>>
>>>?????"I  can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Phil.  4:13


>>>
>>>? "For God so loved the world  that He gave His only son, that whoever
>>>? believes in Him  shall not perish but have eternal  life."
>>>
>>>?????If  you feel the same way forward it to as many people as you can  so
>>>? the love of Jesus will touch their lives  also.
>>>
>>>? My "People I shared the gospel with"  file just got bigger, how about
>>? >  yours?

Larry,
Just thought that I would write to tell you that we  really enjoyed your 
visit. also, we just found out that my Dad passed away this  afternoon (Wed) 
at about 1:30 PM. I would have called but what is there to say.  At least he 
will not be in? pain any more. Apparantly they had just  finished lunch at 
their new house in Silver City when he just fell over in his  chair. Anyway 
we will be leaving in the morning as mother wants to have the  funeral on Sat 
in Hillsboro. I know you are busy so do not  even?consider?coming to the 
funeral.Anyway tell the kids? that  while we enjoyed seeing you, we ?really 
missed seeing them. Hope all is  well. If you need something we will have 
Jans cell (801) 362-1108. Give Teddy  and everyone our love.
Rick

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

goal of saving $1.2 million, or 15 percent, on vehicle and related expenses=
. =20
To provide GPG the ability to realize the savings potential associated with=

these recommendations, it is necessary to implement a standardized GPG Flee=

Procedure.

The GPG Fleet Procedure and associated Addenda address the recommendations =

build a world class fleet.  The key points of the GPG Fleet Procedure are:

Procurement =01) Sets budget guidelines and optimal lifecycle of the fleet.
Vehicle Assignment =01) Identifies employees who will be assigned a Company=

vehicle, Runzheimer or rental car.
Commute  =01) Tracks and identifies those costs associated with commute mil=

that allow GPG to take full advantage of savings opportunities. =20

In the near future, we will be introducing the =01&One Card=018 (MasterCard=

program.  This card will be used for vehicle fuel and maintenance expenses =

Larry,

I just recieved Ashley's request for support for her trip to Las Vegas, and I 
am pleased to inform you that ETS will provide her with $250 to assist in her 
expenses.  It sounds like quite an honor and  I am sure you are quite proud 
of her!!  A check will be processed and sent to you.

Please tell Ashley that she did an excellent job of drafting the request.  I 
could tell that she spent extra time and effort on it!

All of us wish her good luck in the competition.  Please let us know how she 
does.

I am sending this notification to your department to seek a solution of 
halting and stopping inappropriate e mail materials which I am receiving.  I 
have been requested by Louis Soldano, Enron attorney for the Gas Pipeline 
Group, to apprise you of this situation.  The content of materials received, 
I consider offensive, and am sure it would also be considered objectionable 
and innappropriate by the standards of Enron Corporation.   Please be 
advised, that many times it is  difficult to screen this material based upon 
the headings and titles that accompany the contents.  Consequently, 
innappropriate materials such as this are opened.  I have accidently opened 
two such e mails by mistake and have received the "Enron warning"  that my 
name and mailbox will be or may be audited in the future and that my name has 
been placed in a file.    Because of this, I am extremely uncomfortable about 
future accidents occuring and more importantly, about the increased frequency 
and accessability of my e mail box to trash and questionable materials.     

I would appreciate your immediate attention in this matter.  Thank you very 
much.

   Enron/TransCanada -2: Analyst Calls Deal 'Unlikely'

   Dow Jones Energy Service - 08/26/1999

   (Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

   HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. isn't pursuing a purchase of TransCanada 
Pipelines Ltd., a
   spokesman for Enron said Thursday. 

   "There's absolutely no truth to the rumor that Enron wants to buy 
TransCanada," Mark Palmer, a
   spokesman for Enron, told Dow Jones Newswires. 

   TransCanada operates a natural gas pipeline that runs from Alberta to 
eastern Canada. It also
   operates the Nova Gas system, an intraprovincial gas gathering and 
transportation pipeline in
   Alberta. 

   Ordinarily Enron could not comment on rumors about a possible acquisition 
because of Securities
   and Exchange Commission rules, Palmer said. But the company can comment if 
such rumors are
   having an effect on the stock price, he added. The rumor has circulated 
since last month. 

   Raymond Niles, an analyst who follows Enron for Schroders&Co. Inc, put out 
a report Thursday
   morning attributing "recent (Enron) stock price weakness" to the rumor. 

   Niles' report said it would be "highly unlikely" that Enron would buy 
TransCanada. 

   Enron's gas pipeline business accounts for less that 15% of the company's 
total earnings, Niles
   said. Enron's management has said in the past that it doesn't "need to own 
its existing pipeline
   system to grow its core energy marketing business." 

   In the last two years, he said, Enron has moved to reduce its interest in 
non-core businesses such as
   gas pipelines. 

   Enron is also minimizing its investments in hard assets, Niles said in his 
report. The company has
   made investments in strategically located power generating assets, but 
"it's plan is to keep capital
   investments to a minimum ... and monetize existing assets."

Please respond to Janet Thwaits 
Larry,
Just thought that I would write to tell you that we  really enjoyed your visit. also, we just found out that my Dad passed away this  afternoon (Wed) at about 1:30 PM. I would have called but what is there to say.  At least he will not be in  pain any more. Apparantly they had just  finished lunch at their new house in Silver City when he just fell over in his  chair. Anyway we will be leaving in the morning as mother wants to have the  funeral on Sat in Hillsboro. I know you are busy so do not  even consider coming to the funeral.Anyway tell the kids  that  while we enjoyed seeing you, we  really missed seeing them. Hope all is  well. If you need something we will have Jans cell (801) 362-1108. Give Teddy  and everyone our love.
Rick

ENRON
Is Enron Overpriced?
It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial statements are nearly=

In Hollywood parlance, the "It Girl" is someone who commands the  spotlight=

at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate  Hudson. Wall=20
Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still such a  thing as an "I=

Stock." Right now, that title belongs to Enron, the  Houston energy giant.=

While tech stocks were bombing at the box office  last year, fans couldn't=

get enough of Enron, whose shares returned 89%.  By almost every measure, t=
he=20
company turned in a virtuoso performance:  Earnings increased 25%, and=20
revenues more than doubled, to over $100  billion. Not surprisingly, the=20
critics are gushing. "Enron has built  unique and, in our view, extraordina=
ry=20
franchises in several usiness  units in very large markets," says Goldman=

Sachs analyst David Fleischer.=20

Along with "It" status come high multiples and high expectations. Enron  no=

trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more than 2 1/2  times=

the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more than twice  that of the=
=20
S=02?500, and about on a par with new-economy sex symbol  Cisco Systems. En=
ron=20
has an even higher opinion of itself. At a  late-January meeting with=20
analysts in Houston, the company declared that  it should be valued at $126=
 a=20
share, more than 50% above current levels.  "Enron has no shame in telling=
=20
you what it's worth," says one portfolio  manager, who describes such=20
gatherings as "revival meetings." Indeed,  First Call says that 13 of Enron=
's=20
18 analysts rate the stock a buy.=20

But for all the attention that's lavished on Enron, the company remains =20
largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its admirers are  quick =
to=20
admit. Start with a pretty straightforward question: How  exactly does Enro=
n=20
make its money? Details are hard to come by because  Enron keeps many of th=
e=20
specifics confidential for what it terms  "competitive reasons." And the=20
numbers that Enron does present are often  extremely complicated. Even=20
quantitatively minded Wall Streeters who  scrutinize the company for a livi=
ng=20
think so. "If you figure it out, let  me know," laughs credit analyst Todd=
=20
Shipman at S&P. "Do you have a  year?" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credi=
t=20
analyst, in response to the  same question.=20

To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enron's pricey =20
stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine. "I'm somewhat =
=20
afraid of it," admits one portfolio manager. And the inability to get  behi=
nd=20
the numbers combined with ever higher expectations for the  company may=20
increase the chance of a nasty surprise. "Enron is an  earnings-at-risk=20
story,'' says Chris Wolfe, the equity market strategist  at J.P. Morgan's=
=20
private bank, who despite his remark is an Enron fan.  "If it doesn't meet=
=20
earnings, [the stock] could implode."=20

What's clear is that Enron isn't the company it was a decade ago. In  1990=
=20
around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas-pipeline  business.=
=20
But Enron has been steadily selling off its old-economy iron  and steel=20
assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000, 95% of its  revenues and more=
=20
than 80% of its operating profits came from "wholesale  energy operations a=
nd=20
services." This business, which Enron pioneered,  is usually described in=
=20
vague, grandiose terms like the  "financialization of energy"--but also, mo=
re=20
simply, as "buying and  selling gas and electricity." In fact, Enron's view=
=20
is that it can  create a market for just about anything; as if to underscor=
e=20
that point,  the company announced last year that it would begin trading=20
excess  broadband capacity.=20

But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is =20
mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a "logistics  company=
"=20
that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity and  figures out=
=20
the most cost-effective way to transport that commodity to  its destination=
.=20
Enron also uses derivatives, like swaps, options, and  forwards, to create=
=20
contracts for third parties and to hedge its  exposure to credit risks and=
=20
other variables. If you thought Enron was  just an energy company, have a=
=20
look at its SEC filings. In its 1999  annual report the company wrote that=
=20
"the use of financial instruments  by Enron's businesses may expose Enron t=
o=20
market and credit risks  resulting from adverse changes in commodity and=20
equity prices, interest  rates, and foreign exchange rates."=20

Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. "It's very difficult for us  on=
=20
Wall Street with as little information as we have," says Fleischer,  who is=
 a=20
big bull. (The same is true for Enron's competitors, but  "wholesale=20
operations" are usually a smaller part of their business, and  they trade a=
t=20
far lower multiples.) "Enron is a big black box," gripes  another analyst.=
=20
Without having access to each and every one of Enron's  contracts and its=
=20
minute-by-minute activities, there isn't any way to  independently answer=
=20
critical questions about the company. For instance,  many Wall Streeters=20
believe that the current volatility in gas and power  markets is boosting=
=20
Enron's profits, but there is no way to know for  sure. "The ability to=20

With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia 
concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline 
Company offers the following response:

Pipeline Integrity.  With the construction of the evaporation ponds over 
Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored 
the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.  This includes a more frequent 
inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking 
potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.  
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the 
potential of pipeline corrosion.  As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has 
cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline 
coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the 
evaporation ponds.   The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern 
are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system 
at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also 
allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art 
monitoring and detection. 

Noise Issue.  In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern 
conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.  
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures 
which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso 
Station.  Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post 
noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above 
those levels mandated by FERC.  In the event of operational noise levels 
exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to 
performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post 
noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.

Decrepancy of trailer park residents.  In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was 
stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the 
adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study, 
but "more like 35 trailers".  The number of mobile home residences currrently 
in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.  Transwestern's trailer park 
residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job 
market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.  
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job 
economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature 
of the residences.  It should also be noted that during the time that the 
trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the 
operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the 
operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments 
and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the 
trailer park residents.  It was actually noted that many of the spaces 
normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.  This unsanitary 
condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.  The 
NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.

The OCD conducted an environmental inspection of  C/S NO. 5, Thoreau and the 
Bloomfield C/S.  There were no deficiencies or items of concern identified by 
the agency.

Public water sampling has been rescheduled and sampling paramters have been 
determined and given to the contractor who will be conducting the sampling.  
C/S's 3, 4 and 5 are classified as public water systerms and are under the 
jurisdiction of the Navajo Nation and EPA Region IX.

The 2nd quarter PCB Mgt. Committee meeting was held between Transwestern and 
SoCal.  The purpose of this meeting was to reveiw PCB invoices for SoCals PCB 
activities for which Transwestern is 86% responsible.  As a result of th is 
meeting, Transwestern was billed approximately $95,000 for SoCal's quarterly 
PCB management activities.

Recertified 3 individuals on the Artesia team for level 1 environmental skill 
base pay.

Attended Transwestern's annual budget meeting which was held in Albuquerque.

Provided annual SPCC training to the Mountainair team for 2001.   

A meeting was held with the New Mexico Regional Director of the Rocky 
Mountain Elk Foundation.  A presentation was given to the Foundation 
proposing an Enron Partnership with them.   The Foundation was very agreeable 
and is looking forward to Transwestern's participation in their program.  A 
meeting has been scheduled with the Arizona Chapter of the RMEF to discuss 
opportunities for the Transwestern employees volunteer efforts in assisting 
the Arizona Chpater.  An internal presentation will be given at the ETS Cross 
Functional Meeting in Albuquerque in June  to the ETS employees apprising 
them of opportunities for which they can participate in to assist the 
foundation.

NSPS emissions testing was completed  for the "like for like"  turbine power 
turbine replacement at the La Plata C/S in Colorado.  The ;unit sucessfully 
passed the emissions standards for NSPS.

All environmental clearances have been received for the Red Rock Mainline 
Expansion.  The only outstanding environmental issues are the air permits for 
the four C/S.  A ruling has been made  by EPA Region IX and the State of 
Arizona that the applications were ruled complete.  The permits are expected 
to be issued in September of this year.  

Emissions inventories were completed and submitted to the State of Arizona 
for C/S's 1, 2 and the Flagstaff Lateral.

Standard exemptions under the VERP program were submitted to the TNRCC for 
the following major source facilites:  Wt-2, Walton, Spraberry and Eldorado 
C/S.

Larry Campbell and Mike Riedel,

I have spoken with Lou, Bill and Phil Lowry about this suggestion.  Phil had 
no negative reaction to proceeding in the manner described by this email.  
However, I did get a read from Bill and Lou that certain EOTT bases should be 
touched (first) prior to this change in placement of personnel.  Therefore, I 
am asking Bill (by copy of this email) to work with Lou and come up with a 
list of the names of folks that we should visit with prior to formerly 
getting this process started.  Bottom line: this is a good idea and one that 
we probably will do, however, prior to formerly beginning posting of the job, 
etc. - we need to walk the idea through EOTT first.  Call me if you have 
additional thoughts or questions.  Thanks for bringing this idea up - I like 
it.  John Shafer

Subject: EOTT concerns with Fuller's resignation

I had dinner tonight with a Robert Jacobs EOTT  V.P. West Coast and Ed 
Attanasio EOTT Senior Counsel.  This dinner meeting was put together by Gary 
Fuller.  Both Jacobs and Attansio expressed serious concern about ETS's 
abilty to provide environmental expertise and representation at the EOTT 
Bakersfield facilities due to Gary's departure.  They were concerned because 
of the numerous visits by state regulatory personnel conducting unnounced 
onsite inspections and the fact that EOTT may not have an onsite 
environmental representative.  They were highly complementary of Gary and 
were aware of the good repoire he had established with the agencies and they 
felt they would be losing this repoire and credibility if his position was 
not filled with a person located in Bakersfield.  As a courtesy to our 
customer, I told them I would pass on this information to the powers to be in 
Houston.  

After a review of the environmental records and the compliance load for what 
Gary has responsible for,  Im wondering if we should  fill the Bakersfield 
position, or move that position to Midland and possibly use Gary as a 
"temporary technical contact" for ETS.  As you may or may not know, Gary is 
accepting a position with a bakersfield consulting company which specializes 
in providing operation services for energy companys.  Gary will be in charge 
of the environmental  and safety responsibilities for those companies which 
choose to use their service. 

 I understand that there is some environmental sensitivity in California that 
does, at times go above what is required in other states.  However, getting 
the employees at the Bakersfield location on board with skill base pay will 
alleviate much of the existing workload.  What the employees can't handle or 
issues that are above the skill base pay level requirements, can be handled 
and addressed  by Butch and myself with Gary's occasional assistance.  Having 
Gary as a technical contact living in Bakersfield will satisify EOTT's 
concern of having an environmental expert  available for those times when 
agencies arrive unnounced and  at the same time give EOTT the comfort and 
security that they want by knowing that they will be represented by a person 
of Gary's reputation and character. 

In line with this, there appears to be a larger workload and work area in 
MIdland rather than in Bakersfield.  Remediation activites, permitting and 
compliance will be a full time position with the EOTT, Transwestern and 
Northern faciltiies which comprise the Midland area.  In this area, there are 
approximately 13 field teams to provide technical assistance and training 
for.  I feel this will be a full time job.  I think we should give 
consideration to possible using Gary's expertise on a part time basis in 
Bakersfield and relocate and fill his position in Mildand, Tx.

Steve, you have been given all the written permit history and portable 
analyzer correspondance from myself to and from the State of New  Mexico.  
All of my air permit files were copied and sent to you previously.  If there 
is confusion, I apologize but everything that has been agreed to by the State 
of New Mexico has been made available for review and use.

If I need to sit down with you and or others to go over this, let me know.
