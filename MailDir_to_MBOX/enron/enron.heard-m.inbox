Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

We have been working on ISDA's with you for several of our subsidiaries
(Georgia Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Gulf Power Company and
Savannah Electric and Power Company).  Up to this point, we have wanted to
execute an ISDA for each of these companies.  Due to the way in which we
operate our generation assets as a single system, we have decided that we
need to change the way in which we enter these ISDA's.  We would like to
execute a single ISDA with you that includes six of our subsidiaries.  This
is how we have entered some of our physical trading contracts.  In this
arrangement, the counterparty on Southern's side would be listed as,

"Southern Company Services, Inc. as agent for Alabama Power Company, Georgia
Power Company, Gulf Power Company, Mississippi Power Company, Savannah
Electric and Power Company, and Southern Power Company"

By using this approach, we have more flexibility in entering trades and it
provides even stronger credit protection for you since all six of these
companies are on the hook.  Probably the best way to proceed is for you to
forward your comments back to me from the last draft I sent to you.  I will
then make the changes to reflect this approach described above and send back
to you.  I look forward to receiving your comments back.  Please give me a
call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

I was going to bed the other night when my wife told me that I had left the light on in the shed, she could see from the bedroom window. As I looked for myself, I saw that there were people in the shed taking things. 

I phoned the police, but they told me that no one was in his area to help at this time, but they would send someone over as soon as they be available. 

I said OK, hung up, and waited one minute, then phoned the police back. "Hello. I just called you a minute ago because there were people in my shed. Well, you don't have to worry about them now because I've shot them all." 

Within five minutes there were half a dozen police cars in the area, an Armed Response unit, the works. Of course, they caught the burglars red-handed. One of the officers said: "I thought you said that you'd shot them!" 

I replied with "I thought you said there was nobody available!"

Hello Marie -

Yes, I got both of your e-mails.  Thanks very much.  I will call Eric again
and tell him to trace those documents because neither of us has them.  I
really don't know what the problem is, because he used to be so prompt and
efficient.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime I will send the other
documents to you today or at the latest tomorrow.

I am so sorry about what is happening with Enron.  Yes, it is a total shock
- and we are thinking, if it can happen to Enron, it can happen to any
company.  I will keep my fingers crossed for you - in hopes that your
services will be retained.  I cannot imagine what it will be like to have so
many ex Enron employees (and possibly some ex Dynegy employees) flood the
market - and with less and less companies to work for.  Like Conoco and
Phillips - that are now going to be one company also.

I am now sitting in a trade room that used to have 20 people - and was so
busy and loud.  Now I am all by myself, most transferred out and some were
laid off.  Torch is trying to find work for me to do as well - but you know
too how that can work out, I think I am working it week by week.  I am
keeping my ears to the ground..... especially after the New Year.

Good luck to you Marie - and Happy Thanksgiving as well.  This year has not
gone well for many people - so surely the new year will be different.  I
hope so - I expect so.

Do you need the notice information in the agreements or will a listing of the chief executive offices for each work?  I have a listing of the BP Amoco entities and the addresses of their chief executive offices and I can also send Reliant's as set forth in the Master Netting Agreements.

Marie,
	Per my contact at Morgan, It looks as though they cannot give me the new account #'s for Convertible until movement of Convertible from ENA to ECT Investments is complete.  I've reviewed the original Assignment and Assumption Agreement moving Convertible to ENA and it does not reference the new accounts in the agreement.  It does mention the old accounts (the assignor).  

Thanks,
Theresa

Hi, You would not be able to use the old account # for the Convertible acct.  I cannot retrieve a new acct # until the movement of the Convert book back under ECT is complete.
Thx,
Joe

Subject:=09ECTRI-Greenfield Shipping Interest Rate Swap

Justin & Paul,

We are seeking your sign-off and assistance in connection with a swap termi=
nation transaction that is part of an equity sale transaction that is prese=
ntly set to close this Thursday.  The good news is that the documentation h=
as been substantially negotiated by a number of internal and external lawye=
rs (in connection with the equity sale deal) and the swap termination deal =
terms have been discussed and blessed by Gary Hickerson's team in Houston.

The background and basics of the deal are as follows:

In March 1999 Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. ("ECTRI")=
 entered into a long-term interest rate swap with Greenfield Shipping Compa=
ny Limited ("GSCL") in connection with GSCL's project financing of a 135,00=
0 cbm LNG tanker.  The swap was documented by way of an ISDA Master Agreeme=
nt (Multicurrency--Cross Border) and related Confirmation (Deal No. M148198=
), both dated 18 March 1999 (the "Swap Transaction"), and ECTRI's obligatio=
ns under the swap were guaranteed by Enron Corp.  Enron, through its wholly=
-owned subsidiary Atlantic Commercial Finance Inc. ("ACFI"), owns a 20% int=
erest in Greenfield Holding Company Limited ("GHCL"), which in turn owns GS=
CL.  The LNG tanker was intended to be fully-employed in the transportation=
 of LNG to Enron's Dabhol, India facilities.

Due to an alleged default in GSCL's financing caused by the Dabhol project =
situation, GSCL's lenders' threats to accelerate the loan and foreclose upo=
n the vessel, and Enron's lack of desire to maintain an equity interest in =
the vessel, Enron (ACFI) now desires to sell its interest in GHCL to Mitsui=
 OSK Lines Ltd. ("MOL") [for US$5 million] and have the Swap Transaction te=
rminated and the Enron Corp. Guarantee released.  ACFI and MOL entered into=
 a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement on  23 October 2001 which provid=
es for the described equity sale, swap termination and guarantee release.  =
An electronic copy of the signed Sale & Purchase Agreement is attached for =
your reference. =20

The key terms of the deal that relate to the Swap Transaction are as follow=
s: (a) the Swap Transaction is to be terminated (and GSCL's Banks are to pr=
ovide their consent thereto) on 15/11/01; (b) the assumed swap termination =
cost at 23/10/01 was US$20 million which was used as a basis for the Loan N=
ote calculation; (c) ECTRI is to receive US$4 million out of the sale proce=
eds as a down payment against the agreed swap breakage cost, with GSCL exec=
uting a Loan Note in favor of ECTRI for 80% of the balance of the agreed sw=
ap breakage cost (note that ECTRI has 20% of the upside/downside exposure i=
n the event the actual breakage cost varies from US$20 million [US$1 millio=
n for every US$5 million in actual break cost movement]), (d) the Loan Note=
 is to be guaranteed by MOL (Enron Houston Credit Dept. has signed off on M=
OL as an acceptable credit risk) and is to be fully repaid on the earlier t=
o occur of vessel refinancing or 30 April 2002; and (e) Enron Corp. is to b=
e released from its Guarantee obligations in respect of the original Swap T=
ransaction.  The swap is scheduled to be terminated at 9:30 am New York tim=
e on Thursday, Nov. 15.  The amount of the total breagage cost, as well as =
the Loan Note amount may then be calculated and inserted into documents (1)=
 and (2) referenced below.=20

John LaMaster and Mathew Kidwell of Vinson & Elkins represented ACFI, Ian A=
ndrews and Sabien Vermeulen of Linklaters represented GHCL/GSCL in connecti=
on with financing issues and Dan Bradshaw of Johnson, Stokes & Master (Hong=
 Kong) represented MOL.  GSCL's lenders are represented by a team led by Ha=
rry Theochari of Norton Rose.  Peter Anderson, Jordan Mintz and I worked on=
 the equity sale and swap break transaction and have cleared the terms of t=
he swap break transaction with Gary Hickerson and his team in Houston.  Jim=
 Hughes has also signed off on the terms of the equity sale and has agreed =
with Gary Hickerson as to how to internally handle any termination proceeds=
 shortfall.

I attach electronic copies of the following documents, for which we seek yo=
ur sign-off in connection with the equity sale transaction that is presentl=
y set for closing on this Thursday:

1.=09Swap Termination Letter Agreement between ECTRI and GSCL;
2.=09Loan Note 2002 made by GSCL in favor of ECTRI;
3.=09Deed of Guarantee made by MOL in favor of ECTRI;=20
4.=09Deed of Release made by GSCL in favor of Enron Corp.; and
5.=09Certificate of Assistant Secretary of ECTRI [required by GSCL's lender=
s].

Your assistance in signing-off on these documents, as well as helping to ob=
tain any necessary signatures of personnel based in London (I'm assuming th=
at  ECTRI's agent, Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited, must sign in Lon=
don) would be most appreciated.  Of course, I'm happy to respond to any que=
stions or comments you may have, but I'll be in transit to Tokyo for the cl=
osing on Tuesday.  Any of the listed lawyers at V&E and Linklaters would al=
so be happy to respond in my absence.  Sarah Bruck and Peter Anderson are c=
oordinating Enron's efforts from Houston and may also be reached in the eve=
nt you have any questions or need anything further.  Many thanks in advance=
 for the assistance and apologies for the short notice (until today we were=
 incorrectly assuming that this could be coordinated from Houston).

Marie,

This is a pre-existing CP of ECT that did a trade with ECI a while back.  It is my understanding that these can be set up automatically upon request.

Can we complete and revise as needed the attached prime broker agreements?

Please let me know if this is a problem.

Thanks,

Tom

Marie,

  I just spoke to Robert Allen and they are going to send you a retun slip so that the 7 yards can be sent back via UPS without charge.  They have a 17 yard piece that they will ship to you.  I think the Houston show room screwed up the order - because I have a copy of what I sent them in writing - and it says 17 yards.  They have the 17 yards in stock so it shouldn't take long.  Just keep your eyes open for the return tag that they will send you in the mail for the 7 yards.  Ah -  the trials and tribulations of home decorating!

Due to leaving the company:

Peyton S. Gibner left 6-7-01

Per you as they are EES personnel:

Ronald Bertasi
Anthony B. Dayao
Christian R. Holmes IV
Edward M. Ondarza
J. Ozzie Pagan
Gregory L. Sharp

EBS personnel and approved by Lance (I will forward the email to you):

Stewart L. Seeligson

Please print and initial the attached consent we have been working on for these past, what seems like, years.

 
Also, please print and initial the two consent attached below.

The first is a consent cleans up all of the POA's and Special Appts for ENA.  As you will recall, Kim Theriot researched all of the POA's and Special Appts at the indirect urging of Mark Haedicke.  This consent removes all all but seven individuals as Agents and Attorneys-In-Fact.

 
This second consent, language provided by Marie Heard, authorizes 15 individuals on a going forward basis.  Please note, about 7 of these individuals were removed, or had their powers revoked in the previous consent.  It appears that as the trading group would send up consents to replace previous powers, they were added again instead.

 

These should bring ENA as up to speed as we can make it.

Thanks,

Mx

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.
As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the
ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of
Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable
you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great
company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's
future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has
tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from
your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you
exercise your options.

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock
Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the
intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options
granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to
your home address.

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock
Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?    2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?    2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?    A "How to Exercise Options" document that contains contact information
and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Be sure to talk to Peter on any of the Canada related master nettings so he can orchestrate any necessary Canada filings.  I have spoken with him on this matter so he should be up to speed.  Any questions, stop by.

We will need the "organizational ID" number for the Delaware, Maryland and
Texas entities.  If you wish, we can obtain this information from CT Corp.
or a similar service provider for a charge of $12 per entity.

Also, for UCC filing purposes, we need to know whether any counterparty is
a "transmitting utility", i.e., entity primarily engaged in transmitting or
producing electricity or transmitting goods by pipeline.

Finally, I assume you will consult with local counsel regarding the
Canadian counterparties.

Thank you.

We have our own form of corporate resolutions.  It was being circulated for signature by the directors and I just received it back today.  I told Kelly Keneally when I sent the documentation to her that we were in the process of routing this for signature and that I would send her a certificate certifying these resolutions when completed.

Marie--

Finally--I'm getting back to you with comments on these ISDA's.  Although the counterparty is now proposing something different, I thought I would send you this for your files.  I'm attaching the document that I went through for Georgia Power.  The changes to the documents are the same for all three, with exception of the specified thresholds.  The only difference will be the thresholds as follows:

Savannah Electric and Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B changed to $10MM will be acceptable, Threshold of $10MM will be acceptable, and the minimum transfer amount should be $100M (not $500 as they requested).
Mississippi Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B being changed to $20MM will be acceptable, Threshold should be countered to $15MM, and min transfer countered at $100M.
Georgia Power Company: Threshold info, etc is located in the attached document.

I've highlighted all of my comments in yellow below.  Again, the same comments (except for the thresholds, etc. mentioned above) should resemble the other two documents.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again and I apologize for the delay.

Veronica

Sara and Marie,

Can you fax the ENA agreement to Bob Georgio, head of Customer Accounts, 212-325-1987, Fax 917-326-8030?
I told him we got the ECT Investments back but have not seen the ENA since 7/6/01, when sent to CSFB, and have not gotten a response from CSFB on inqueries.

He wants to take a look at it.  The other contact I got was Marcel McNeal, 212-538-4415, Prime Broker accounts but we will try Bob Georgio first.

Sheila

Legal Team--

ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. would like to replace the current Gty's that Enron has issued to them and receive one overall gty to cover the financial and physical business with ENA, ECC, ENA Upstream Company, LLC, EPMI, EES and EGLI.  This would include the trading executed under the ISDA, GISB, and GTC's.  In executing this new gty, we would simultaneously cancel the existing outgoing Gty's that we have out to them already.  The cap amount on this new Gty would be $75MM.

Can you please advise whether this is acceptable or not so that I can tell the counterparty--we're currently avoiding posting cash on a Margin call as ONEOK will accept a higher Gty amount to cover their exposure.

Thanks,

Veronica

Sara -

At the point the language was agreed to in the below agreement we may not
have been aware of the regulatory contraints under PUHCA that does not allow
for the inclusion of Affiliates under Set-Off (we may actually have to amend
that agreement to carve it out).

With respect to the our ISDA, I will make sure to forward to Anthony the
provision in question and ask him when he has some availability to get on a
call in the beginning of next week to discuss.

Regards,
Michelle

Per my voice mail, please:

(1) review the Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement dated March 1,
2000 (Section 4.4(d)) between Allegheny Energy Supply Company LLC and Enron
Power Marketing, Inc., as amended, for your previously negotiated setoff
language, and

(2) please forward a copy of the proposed setoff language to Anthony Wilson
so that he can explain what portion of the provision violates Section 6 of
PUHCA.  I will be available for a call at his (and your) convenience.

Thanks.  Sara

   I spoke with Yair about your suggestion to have a "unilateral" approach
   to
   include Affiliates for yourselves but not for us since we are restricted
   by
   PUHCA (as explained by Anthony Wilson, our in house regulatory attorney)
   and
   he is inclined to not agree to your request (our approach is either if
   applied to both of us or neither of us).

   Let me know if you need to discuss this further - in which case we will
   get
   on a call (Yair, you and myself) to discuss.

   I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has
   informed
   me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated
   Affiliates
   in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
   approval from the SEC.

   Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates
   in
   Set Off, as per our original request.

      As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
      incorporating
      the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of
   ISDA
      (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached
   is
      the
      last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
      suggest
      that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of
   agreement
      since it is the final version.

       <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

      Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
      which
      point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
      page)
      via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
      Schedule with your revised Schedule.

      Thank you for your patience.

I have another one for you guys.  I do not anticipate any urgency on this, but would still like it out of the way.

Thanks,

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Thank you and best regards,

Marie--

Finally--I'm getting back to you with comments on these ISDA's.  Although the counterparty is now proposing something different, I thought I would send you this for your files.  I'm attaching the document that I went through for Georgia Power.  The changes to the documents are the same for all three, with exception of the specified thresholds.  The only difference will be the thresholds as follows:

Savannah Electric and Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B changed to $10MM will be acceptable, Threshold of $10MM will be acceptable, and the minimum transfer amount should be $100M (not $500 as they requested).
Mississippi Power Company: 3rd Party debt for Party B being changed to $20MM will be acceptable, Threshold should be countered to $15MM, and min transfer countered at $100M.
Georgia Power Company: Threshold info, etc is located in the attached document.

I've highlighted all of my comments in yellow below.  Again, the same comments (except for the thresholds, etc. mentioned above) should resemble the other two documents.  Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks again and I apologize for the delay.

Veronica

1.   Replace Paragraph 1 with:



     This Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement (this "Agreement")
     is made and entered into effective as of November [   ], 2001 by and
     among BNP Paribas (including all branches and agencies thereof,
     "BNPP"), BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. ("PFI") and BNP Paribas
     Commodity Futures Limited ("BNPPCML"), and Enron Corp. ("Enron"),
     Enron North America Corp. ("ENA"), Enron Power Marketing, Inc.
     ("EPMI"), Enron Risk Management and Trading International Corp.
     ("ERMTIC"), Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.
     ("ECTRIC"), Enron Credit Limited ("ECL"), Enron Metals Limited ("EML")
     and Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited ("ECTD").



2.   Change definition of BNPP Party to "means each of BNPP, PFI and
BNPPCML."

3.   Change definition of Enron Party to " means each of Enron, ENA, EPMI,
ECTRIC, ERMTIC, ECL, EML and ECTD."

4.   In the definition of Transaction, insert before the word "between"
"(i)" and add at the end the following:

     or (ii) held at a contract market, exchange, board of trade or
     clearing organization by any Party on behalf of a member of the other
     Group pursuant to an Underlying Master Agreement.

5.   In Section 2(b), in (i), replace the phrase "all Transactions under
one or more Underlying Master Agreements" with "each Transaction".

6.   In Section 2(b), at the end of (ii) and (v) before the semi-colon,
insert the following:

     , under any other agreement or under applicable law or equity, whether
     in respect of the Transactions thereunder, or otherwise

7.   In Section 2(b), at the end of (iii), after "applicable law", insert
"or equity"

8.   In Section 4, in the third sentence, after the words "from whom such
payment is due" insert the following:

     to such Party or Parties as the Non-defaulting Group determines are
     entitled to such payment

9.   In Section 7(b), in each of the forth and the twelfth lines between
the words "hereby" and "grants", insert "except as provided in the next
sentence" and in each of the ninth and the sixteenth lines replace the text
beginning "Obligations, " until the end of each sentence with:

     Obligations.  Without limiting the rights referred to in Section 5,
     the security interest granted in the immediately preceding sentence
     shall not apply to the Final Settlement Amount.

10.   At the beginning of Sections 7(c) and 7(e), insert the words "Subject
to Section 3,".

11.   In Section 15(b), following the words "on the basis of a payment
owed", insert the words "(including margin)".

12.   With respect to Section 17, our client has indicated that it would
not be useful or efficient to have the issue of arbitration (which is
clearly not central to the risk reducing purposes of the arrangements)
mixed up with the proposed agreement, which has arisen from the
circumstances of Enron that have developed over the last few months.  BNP
Paribas' primary reason for not wanting to include an arbitration clause
(even with the suggested language changes) is that, although the concept of
arbitration is being considered generally, BNP Paribas has, of yet, not
made any definitive decisions as to the implicit or necessary value of
arbitration clauses and such a decision would require significant internal
review and discussion.  Over the next few months, further consideration can
be given as to including arbitration in this agreement.

13.  Please note that BNP Paribas contemplates at least one long-form
confirmation as an Underlying Master Agreement.

Sara -

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Regards,
Michelle

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Kravet will COD me and Schumacher will be charged to my credit card.  Once I place the orders I'll know the exact amount, including freight.  So I'll let you know.

Isn't it a big scam that these stores have!  The mark up is always between 40 and 50%, depending on the manufacturer.

Yes, please.  Also, please add taxes.  We certainly don't want to do anything that will mess his records up since you all are so kind to do this.  Do you want us to pay in advance?  That won't be a problem either.

Thanks!

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

We need everything, although I would have thought the ISDAs, confirmations and guarantees were everything.  Send it all, overnight, to Liisa, Transaction Support Department, at Enron House in London.

Mary Cook has asked me to try to locate the documentation for the two prepays.  Which of the documents do you specifically need--all or just the ISDAs, swap confirmations and guarantees.  If you only need the ISDAs, etc., it may be quite a lot of pages to fax.  Would you prefer I overnight them and, if so, where should I send them?

Thanks!

I think it would be helpful going forward to elicit the counterparty's
organizational ID number in the signature block where we currently obtain
its jurisdiction of organization and location of chief executive office.
This would probably save a bit of time and money.

On May 22, 2001, I sent an email to you regarding the aforementioned account assignment.  I also copied Nikki Kroll on that email.  ENA and ECI are anxious to have this assignment executed but we have not had any response.  I am reattaching a copy of the assignment for your convenience.  I will need your assistance in identifying the ECI account with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS").  Stephanie Panus sent Nikki Kroll the ECI account documentation via overnight delivery on May 18, 2001.

Please direct your attention to the following:

(1)  Please execute and return to ECI an original Corporate Account Agreement with GS.  Also, please provide ECI with the account number.

(2)  Please review the attached Assignment and Assumption Agreement and advise if we can execute and forward to GS for execution.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Larry Anderson with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an Enron Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that Enron Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, Enron Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  

Joe, I believe that Larry may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

Tom:  Please forward your requisite email request to Donna Lowry, Rick Carson and Bill Bradford with your request and reasons.

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

Thanks.  Sara

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

I will investigate getting an accounting entity set up for ECTMI - does anyone know the number?

in the meantime (and don't shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEF
broker account to have a new name - see company below

We must move Anker as a matter of urgency.  Let's discuss.

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

  " We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them
worse.

For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like for them to know
about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cream and leftover meat loaf
sandwiches.  I really would.

I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by
being cheated.  I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and
wash the car.  And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you
are sixteen.

It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old
dog put to sleep. I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you
believe in.

I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother.  And it's all
right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he
wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let
him.  When you want to see a movie and your little brother wants to tag
along, I hope you'll let him.

I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live
in a town where you can do it safely.  On rainy days when you have to catch
a ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you
won't be seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom.

If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead
of buying one.  I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.

When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract
in your head.  I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your
first crush on a guy/girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you
learn what ivory soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if  you try a beer
once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if a friend offers you dope or a
joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go fishing
with your Uncle.

May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.  I hope your
mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your neighbor's
window, and that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time when you give
her a plaster mold of your hand.

These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work and
happiness. To me, it's the only way to appreciate life.

Written with a pen.  Sealed with a kiss.  I'm here for you.  And if I die
before you do, I'll go to heaven and wait for you.

Send this to all of your friends. We secure our friends, not by accepting
favors, but by doing them.

Paul Harvey RIDDLE: When asked this riddle, 80% of kindergarten kids got the
answer, compared to 17% of Stanford University seniors.

What is greater than God, More evil than the devil, The poor have it, The
rich need it, And if you eat it, you'll die?

Send this to 10 people and then press shift and you will get the answer.

P.S. You won't believe this, but this really does give you the answer!!!!

God Bless and Angel Hugs....... "

I checked with Harlan Murphy and he said it hadn't been signed, however, the master netting agreement references an executed master agreement dated as of 10/10/01.  We haven't seen either the original or a copy of the signed agreement.

I called and left a message w/Steven Smith and response before I went out.  Robin Hill has the information -- not sure what the hold up is, Steven says it's b/c he is trying to find someone to sign the document, but that was almost two weeks ago.

I still haven't heard from these folks.  I talked to Steven Smith last week on 10/24/01 and he said there were no issues with the MSA, but he was having a hard time finding someone to sign it.  I told Jane this info last week.  I haven't heard back from him either via email or phone, should I pursue this further?  One more call before I go out on maternity leave?  I know Jane is anxious to get this back signed.

Please advise.

Thanks

Hi Dave  
Here is a revised draft for discussion purposes only of the MNA, marked to show changes from the prior draft of 11/8.  In order to get this to you for your review as soon as possible, I am by copy of this email sending drafts to others in Enron's legal, credit and commercial groups for their first review;  accordingly, there likely will be additional changes based upon their review.  Please call if you have any questions or comments. Thanks

Dear Ms. Heard,

	On behalf of my colleague Michael Mask, I attach a draft ISDA
Schedule and a draft Credit Support Annex for your review.  The terms are
subject to CSFB's review of the draft Enron Guarantee that I believe Lissa
Rosenthal has discussed with you.  Please forward this Guarantee, along with
any comments you may have to the attached, to Michael (212-538-2313) or me.
(Although Michael is negotiating this transaction, he will be out of the
office for the next week and I will be the contact in the interim.)

Thank you,

Reid Gray
212-538-2327

Hello Marie, per our conversation this morning, please find attached Coastal
States Trading, Inc.'s standard schedules, along with a copy of our guaranty
format.  We prefer to make proposed changes directly on the electronic
version(as opposed to hard copy).  Please red-line the schedule on the PC,
put a draft date in the upper right hand corner of the first page of both
schedules, then email the schedules back to John Shuttee for review.  John
will handle all negotiations for this ISDA.  He can be reached at
713/420-3548 or john.shuttee@elpaso.com.

Thanks for attention to this matter.

Frank and Marie,

I have received and reviewed Enron's faxed Authorizations for the ISDA
Master Agreement between Amerada Hess Corporation and Enron North America
Corp. and they are acceptable.  I look forward to receiving the original
Authorizations shortly.

I am also in receipt of the original ISDA Master Agreement, partially
executed by Enron.  I am in the process of attaching Amerada Hess
Corporation's signature. As soon as the original Agreement is fully
executed, I will overnight you a fully executed original ISDA Master
Agreement.

Thank you for your cooperation throughout the entire drafting process.

Hi, John:

Can you answer Athena's questions re Navajo?

It you want to just respond to me, I'll include it in my response re Louis Dreyfus.

Thanks!

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.

Best Regards,
Athena

It is my understanding that the companies mentioned above have been amalgamated, with Norske Skog Canada Limited retaining the name.  Are you aware that this occurred?  Norske Skog is wanting me to bill Pacifica Paper's swaps under Norske Skog's name going forward.

Please let me know!

Thanks,
Gordon

I didn't mention it on the earlier ones, but for all of these, if any of the agreements have been amended, I will need any amendments, as well as any guarantees.  Much thanks!

Marie,

   What is the threshold for an eligible contract participant for an entity?  Is it $5MM?  I have a New Zealand counterparty who would like to delete the eligible contract participant rep. 

  All here is pretty spooky - we are just waiting for the hammer to drop!

Sara -

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Enclosed is an ISDA worksheet for Panaco Inc.  They are very interested, as are many right now, in getting an ISDA in place that has netting language between financial transactions and physical gas.  Physical gas is done both at ENA and ENA Upstream Company LLC.  Can we put together such a document?  If there are any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks,

Max

With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff for your non-regulated affiliates.  Perhaps you could provide us with the regulated affiliate(s) for a carve out.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Regards,
Michelle

	Since Jay is out this week, I'll be "working" on the master netting for Forest Oil and Noble Affiliates.  When these are ready to go out please send a copy to me so I can advise the counterparties.  Thank you.

Ed:

This is a follow up to our conversation we had on Monday regarding the cross
commodity, cross affiliate netting agreement. 
As of today, Thursday Nov. 15, we have not received anything.  In order to
expedite things, I think it would be helpful for our legal councils to
directly contact each other regarding this matter. Therefore, I am sending
you the phone number and email address of my legal council (Name: Thomasine
Pantazis; Phone Number (713) 350-1663; email - tpantazis@tractebelusa.com)
I would appreciate it if you could provide the same information on Ms.

Legal -

Attached below is an Omnibus Confirm worksheet for BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.   Please prepare the appropriate annexes and forward to the financial confirmations group as soon as possible.

 



Financial Confirms -

Upon receipt of the credit annexes from Legal, please send out confirms for the following trades:

YJ4705.1		YJ7870.1
YJ4707.1		YJ7870.2

Please note that these trades are currently booked to BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P.  This is, obviously, not the correct counterparty name.  Please correct and send confirmations at your earliest convenience.




Derek and George -
 
I have Global Counterparty setting up this new entity in our systems.  Please ensure that these trades get moved from BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P. to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  Margin calculations are dependent on these trades being booked correctly.  While Mike Larsen has been very accomodating, our margin team can not afford to spend time reconciling trades at the present.



Thanks to all for your help.

I also noticed on Inland Paperboard and Packaging, Inc./ENA, CP #66189, we are still waiting for the executed agreement since July 10th.  Is it normal for a company to take this long to return the executed agreement?  We have set up a global contract number (96063822) to allow them to do on-line trading.

Dear Lucy:

Our financial council considers that there should be no problem to
include your comments in the guaranty form, although it has to be
authorized by the corporate council.  We are currently working on that
authorization and will let you know as soon as we have an answer.

Best regards,
Martha Navarro

Are we supposed to be filing against Conagra?  As far as I know, we don't
have any information regarding this counterparty.

Attached is a proposed netting agreement from Vitol that would cover only methanol book transfers.  It looks ok to me but I wanted to run it by you to see if you have any comments.
Thanks,

Goldman is pushing agressively toward execution of the Master Close-Out Agreement. So much so, that they have forwarded to me an executed counterpart signed by their three affiliates. I left you (and Carol) a voice mail a little while ago, please give me some guidance on this.

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.

Best Regards,
Athena

Our Corporate Lawyers just agreed to your suggested addition to the
Recitals Section.  In order to be able to execute the Guaranty we need

already in process.  Carlos Riveroll contacting you to reach an
agreement regarding the Amendment to the MSA to incorporate the
Guaranty. In the mean time we will prepare the execution copyes be
ready to sign it.

Best regards,

   Lucy:

   Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes
you
   requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

   1.      Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add
that
   "The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
   Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI".  Please explain.
[Heard,
   Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies
   the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of
   enforceability.

   2.      Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
   days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
   need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt
of
   the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay
with
   this change.

   3.      Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York
Jurisdiction is
   a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of
derivatives
   trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the "exclusive" jurisdiction
   of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard,
Marie]
      We are okay with the "exclusive" jurisdiction.

   The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
   be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
   finalize this as soon as posible.

   Best regards,

   Martha Navarro

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Thank you for the drafts.  We are working on comments and hope to get you a redraft this week.   
Question - Can we incorporate Enron Capital $ Trade International (and LD's UK subsidiary) with the U.S. group or should we leave it as U.S. only?

Sara,

I spoke with Jeff and as we are winding down the book he asked that we just draw this out a little bit.  He feels it is not going to be needed as the book is going away.  Also there is no intention of moving any securities from one entity to the other.

Thanks,

Tom

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Hi You'all - just a note to say hello before I dash off to run errands and
also wanted to ask you a favor.  On July 14th you sent us an accounting of
your events with the flooding and I saved it in our email messages.
Actually printed it out but the first word of each line did not print and
now I only have pgs. 2 and 3.  We subsequently have had to change our email
address and was wondering if you perchance saved this one and could re-send
it to us at this address as we want to save it in Word and print it and put
it in the family album - That was hopefully a once in a lifetime event and
whomever, Anne or Marie wrote it you did an awesome job with your
descriptions.  Let us know if you can't find it as John said they did back
stuff up (as we also recently changed to an updated computer program) and he
said that he might be able to resurrect it for us but to ask you first.
Have you gotten everything all back to normal?  How are the kitty cats
doing?  We are looking forward to Mama Rita's visit and Stephen and I want
to take her to "Late Night Catechism" - in fact we are getting the tix
tomorrow - there are all kinds of things we want to do when she is here but
not enough time.  It will be fun to have her go to Min and Mike's for
Thanksgiving and she will be here for Isabel's "1st" B'Day.  By the way
speaking of birthdays, hope you had a nice one, Marie (you're still way
younger than all of us!!!) Hope work is going okay (are you in another dept?
  - thought Rita told us you had changed something job-wise) Anne, am sure
you are busy as ever.  We had a fun time at Michele's (she did get her
layoff notice from BAC) and will be through I think it is Dec. 14th) for
Marianne's 40th B'Day. It was a '70's theme with music from ABBA, Tacos,
chocolate cake and all the family - it was nice to see that Michele's place
worked for a large family gathering as we hope to down-size in a couple
years. Stephen along with John and Stevie's help have been making a lot of
progress downstairs.  Stevie and Jennifer will be moving to a new home (it
is a lot like yours and Michele's in northeast Tacoma) it will be ready
after the first of the year - will be in neighborhood with sidewalks which
will be nice with Isabel as the home they are in now, though the yard is
fenced is on a busy street.  They have sold it fortunately at a profit and
it definitely paid off to have their downstairs finished.  We were happy to
hear about Sydney Nicole joining the family and it is nice for Cameron to
have a little sister.  Am sure you'all as well as we are still feeling
uneasy about everything since Sept.  It is unsettling not knowing if another
event will surface.  A few weeks ago they had extra security around the
bridges here and in CA  but am sure whatever happens if it does will happen
without any notice. Steffi is still working as a temp employee with Maxim
Systems, she hopes to get hired as a permanent employee within the next
couple weeks.  She is contemplating moving home next year as she really
misses the family and seeing the little one. She will be going to AZ fot
Thanksgiving to see Vicki and Norm and family, and Jessica and her husband,
Bob will be there - they are expecting a little one in March). Well, I
better dash as I need to run some errands and plan on meeting Stephen in
about 2 hrs. at QFC (he is on his way back from Port Angeles for his CG
drill - he only has one more drill in Dec. and then will be retiring - can't
believe he has been active for the last 20 yrs.  It will be nice to have one
extra weekend with him home each month.  Let us know about the article and
if you can't find it maybe John (our computer guru) can resurrect it- he has
been working out at Microsoft in Redmond and will be there for several
months for training for his company, Avanade - seems to like it. Bye for
now, tell the family hi, Love, Maureen and Stephen

Good Morning Sara,

I wanted to touch base with you regarding the CSFB 2001 Equity Swap Basket documentation. Since the last time we spoke here are some of the issues discussed along with some additional recommendations.

1) Finalizing the Master ISDA Agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Limited. I see that the status is under Credit Review.

2) Definitions:
	a) Interest Payment Date- should state "3 business days after the Valuation Date"
	b) Reference Price- amend the phrase "..last regular way trade..." to state "...Official Closing Price..." in (i) and (ii)(b)(iii).
	c) Securities- Omit the reference to "Bonds". The definition should only read: "are the securities specified as such in the Confirmation".
	d) Valuation Date (s)- October 15, 2001, November 15, 2001, ... October 15, 2002
	
3) Section 5.1 (i)- Omit the reference to Bonds. This section (i) should read: "If a Security pays a dividend or makes another distribution, the payment to be made by the Seller shall be equal to the gross amount of the cash dividend or distribution per share (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any tax credits), as the case may be, multiplied by the Dividend Percentage, multiplied by the Contract Quantity".

We should include a definition for "Dividend Payment Date" to read, "The Equity Payment Date relating to the Valuation Date (s) on which the relevant Dividend Period ends". We should also include a definition for "Dividend Amount". The "Dividend Amount" definition should read, "100% of all ordinary cash dividends where; (i) the ex-dividend date occurs during the period from the day following the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date and (ii) the date on which the related ordinary cash dividend would have been received by persons who held the Shares comprising the Basket during such period is during the relevent Dividend Period".

I believe we should address Section 5.2 "Potential Adjustment Event". We should recommend replacing the language similar to the Intra-Period Adjustment language we utilitized in the Enron Credit Confirmation. Their section allows CSFB to "determine" the provisions of the Intra-Period Adjustments. CSFB should not have control over determining any additonal payment or adjustment of the Opening Price or Contract Quantity. The Intra-Period adjustment language is comprehensive in covering all provisions therein.

4) Schedule to Basket Swaps:
	a) Applicable Interest Rate Cycle: should read "1 month"
	b) Termination Date: should read "1 year"
	c) Business Day Convention: should be the standard ISDA "Modified Following Business Day Convention" language.

5) We should also include the Annex structure to be able to monitor the positions held, along with any subsequent adjustments, in the Equity Swap Basket at any time throughout the deal.

Please advise if you like to meet to discuss the documentation in further detail.

Regards,

All:  We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES.
The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?
Please respond.  Thanks for your help.

Our London accounting group informed us that we needed to transfer positions held in Anker Coal from Enron Credit Inc to a Fair Value Entity, that was a US entitiy, rolling to EEL, that was set up to own brokerage accounts.  The ECTEF entity is the result.  

Should you need more details let me know.

Tom

Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.

ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].

Tom:  Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc.

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Thanks.

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.

Sandy,

Can you check with Robbi or Marie and compare this to an older version of our standard MSA.  It looks identical to what we used to use prior to Cynthia coming up with the U.S./Europe version.  It incoporates the concepts of contract value and replacement value.

Thanks,

JANE, attached please find the redlined comparison you requested of the Kevin Paley document (CW MSA V4.5(2).doc) compared to the standard MSA.  Hope this comparison is helpful and shows you all the changes made.

Call me please at Ext. 53879 if you need me to do anything else to assist you in comparing the documents.

All,
 
Doesn't look like he's too interested in our Master.  Can we take another look at theirs to see if they made any changes at all that we wanted?  I haven't yet had a chance to take a look at it.

Timing is everything.  Today I spoke to DB about the ETA amendment.  Unfortunately, many of their workers remain quite shaken by the Sept. events as their office is farily close to ground zero.  

We have one issue outstanding.  I have provided language to their counsel that I believe will satisfy their concerns.  I am not waiting for an approval of that language.  Presuming it comes this week, we should be done.

Please let me know if any of you should have any further questions.

Thanks.

We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????

Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!!

Actually, we don't know what we're going to do.  We were talking about this
last night and since our house is still torn up and we haven't ordered a
dinner yet maybe the best thing is just go somewhere to eat.  I said maybe
we could go to an early movie and then go eat someplace.  Even ribs at
Luthers or a Whataburger would be good .  What do you think?

I would love a few oysters.

Me

p.s.  Yes, I think all the Marie's have closed!

Hi!  What are y'all doing Thursday?  Do y'all just
want to meet someplace or what?  If so, where?

Also, did the Marie Calendar's by you all close?
Rossana was saying that the ones she used to go to
have all closed.

Also, would you like some raw oysters from Nelson's?
I know Marie doesn't, but I know you like 'em and I
won't be eating all of them.  Lou said that we'd be
getting some more at Christmas.      Me

Subject:=09Mirant Canada's purchase of TransCanada Pipelines trading busine=
ss

On October 11, Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. purchased a substantial =
portion of TransCanada Pipeline's trading and marketing business. As a resu=
lt, Mirant will be purchasing the entire business of TransCanada Energy Fin=
ancial Products Limited, and will be taking assignment of the physical gas =
transactions/contracts of TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and TransCanada Gas=
 Services, a division of TransCanada Energy Ltd.

As a result of this transaction, TransCanada Pipelines Ltd. will be termina=
ting whatever credit support they provided for these entities and that cred=
it support will be picked up by Mirant Corp, depending on the arrangements =
that we have negotiated. With respect to TransCanada Energy Financial Produ=
cts Limited, it was agreed that the ISDA that is currently between Enron Ca=
nada Corp. and TransCanada Energy Financial Products Limited will be assign=
ed to Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd under the same credit terms as cur=
rently exist.  Mirant Corp will issue a $30 million USD guaranty to provide=
 the credit support for this document, the same dollar amount that TransCan=
ada Pipelines Ltd was providing.  They have also agreed to provide whatever=
 necessary collateral to cover their exposure, over the threshold, as a res=
ult of their purchasing this entity.

With respect to TransCanada Gas Services Inc., the only outstanding gas tra=
nsactions are with Enron North America and these all relate to physical pro=
duct. There is no contract between TransCanada Gas Services Inc. and Enron =
North America, but TCPL is currently providing a guaranty for this business=
. This guaranty will be terminated, and these transactions will be covered =
under a current Mirant Corp guaranty covering Mirant Canada Energy Marketin=
g Ltd. for physical gas transactions with Enron North America. This current=
 guaranty is for USD $10 million and is of a sufficient amount to cover the=
 current exposure as well as the exposure being brought over from TransCana=
da Gas Services Inc..

Finally, with respect to TransCanada Gas Services, a division of TransCanad=
a Energy Ltd, there is currently a physical gas master with Enron Canada Co=
rp. However, this was executed in 1993 and is outdated with respect to cred=
it provisions. I have been working with the credit contact at Mirant Canada=
 to get a new physical master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketin=
g Ltd. This new master would govern all existing trades between ECC and Mir=
ant Canada, as well as those coming over from TransCanada Gas Services, a d=
ivision of TransCanada Energy Ltd. However, in the interim, the TransCanada=
 trades would still be covered by the existing master. TransCanada Pipeline=
s will terminate their guaranty of this entity with respect to these transa=
ctions.  Alternatively, Mirant Corp has agreed to amend their existing guar=
anty covering physical gas transactions between Mirant Canada Energy Market=
ing Ltd. and Enron Canada Corp by increasing the coverage from USD $30 mill=
ion to USD $50 million. This entity also has some exposure with Enron North=
 America, which will also be covered under the existing Mirant Corp. guaran=
ty for USD $10 million.

A contract between ENA and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd. would also b=
e an ideal outcome out of this; however, the first priority is getting a ne=
w physical gas master between ECC and Mirant Canada Energy Marketing Ltd.

If there is any other information that I can provide on this matter, please=
 do not hesitate to contact me.

Thanks

Sara-

As discussed, I am forwarding the correspondence from Beth Ng of Morgan Stanley containing the draft netting agreements (based on the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Ltd. forms provided to Morgan Stanley) to be entered into by EGLI and ERAC.  

I am attaching below, amended versions of the netting agreements that Morgan Stanley would like to enter into today.  I note that Tom Moran, who heads up EGM credit, would like to get Morgan Stanley comfortable ASAP.

Let me know if there is any problem with entering into these arrangements.

Thanks for your help.

John

We have now received a new Password Application  and ETA amendment for the referenced counterparty.  As of the close of business today, we have shut down Bankers Trust Company for EOL trading.  All EOL trading should now be done through the referenced entity.  Enron has executed a Novation Agreement which is currently at Deutsche Bank for execution.  Per DB, we should receive the executed copy back from them on Monday.  Upon receipt of this Novation Agreement, all of the current Bankers Trust financial trades will be moved under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Inc. dated  12/29/00.

Global Counterparty:  Please ensure that the ISDA Master referenced above is attached to this counterparty in EOL.

Confirmation Desk:  Please ensure that all EOL financial confirmations show this counterparty as "Deutsche Bank AG, acting through its New York Branch"

MUCH THANKS!!!

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

I'm working on a netting agreement with Southern Company Services, agent for the Southern Companies.  However, it is not a master netting agreement.  It's merely a closeout set-off and payment netting agreement to cover physical power transactions alone.  I've discussed the matter with Ed Sacks in credit, and we're treating this one as a straight power contract negotiation, not as a master netting agreement.  

Please let me know if you still want daily updates regarding the status.  Otherwise, I won't bore you!

Sara and Marie,

Yesterday we moved positions from several futures brokers to Fimat Derivatives Canada.  We had an account there previously, A/C # K2300.

They are requesting account documentation forms be signed today because our prior account with them was under HSBC and they want to get it directly in the name of Enron North America.

They are e-mailing account forms to me today and I will forward to both of you as soon as I receive.

Gary and Jeff Shankman requested that we move positions to FIMAT.

Sheila

Jackie,

Legal is reviewing the Terms of Business document for Credit Lyonnais
and Monument Derivatives.

For Equities and Options, we will trade as ECT Investments, Inc.  with
all clearing through Goldman Sachs International and Morgan Stanley &
Co.

For Futures, we will trade as Enron North America Corp. with Give-up to
Carr Futures and Deutsche Banc Alex Brown Inc. We are currently in the
process of setting up the Deutsche Bank agreement.  Rob Manders,
212-469-2034, Rob.Manders@db.com,  may be contacted for more
information.

Legal thought that for the futures we only require your give-up
agreements to Carr and DB and will not need the Terms of Business
Agreement on the Futures side.

Please advise.
Sheila

Yes - and Mary Nell asked to come back to Houston and was told no (according to my source).  Things are very bleak!  Carol and Lance are on some emergency project.  Lance worked all night.  I think we are in big trouble!  Do you hear any scoop?

Well, I guess that's why they get to have such nice, pretty stores.  What's Eric doing up here meeting with the attorneys?  Also, Jane said that Mary Nell and Peter were given packages?  Is this true?

Kravet will COD me and Schumacher will be charged to my credit card.  Once I place the orders I'll know the exact amount, including freight.  So I'll let you know.

Isn't it a big scam that these stores have!  The mark up is always between 40 and 50%, depending on the manufacturer.

Yes, please.  Also, please add taxes.  We certainly don't want to do anything that will mess his records up since you all are so kind to do this.  Do you want us to pay in advance?  That won't be a problem either.

Thanks!

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

Can you confirm that the listed Liquid Payments Netting Agreements would not apply to power-related receivables held by Enron Power Marketing, Inc.?

Attached is a copy of the master netting assignments list that sets forth those that are signed and/or currently being worked on.  As you can see, BP Amoco, Dynegy and Reliant have recently been executed.  A master crude netting agreement has been signed with ConAgra.  Liquid payments netting agreements have been signed with Coastal, Conoco, Morgan Stanley, Sunoco and Valero.  Master Netting Agreements have previously been executed with PG&E, The New Power Company and Entergy-Koch Trading, LP.  

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Afternoon,
	Enclosed is an amended worksheet for Ineos Acrylics Inc.  We sent a draft under a different name a couple of months ago.  This entity will be guaranteed by the ultimate parent as described in the worksheet.  Please prepare this draft and forward to Eric and Graham at Ineos, with a copy to me.  
	Give me a call with any questions.

Thanks,

Hi Marie -

I now have executed assignments from UOM and Dynegy.  I called Eric Twombly
at Sempra and he said that they may have sent it directly to Enron (you??).
I want to call Eric again today, but wanted to make sure first that he
indeed had not send the originals directly back to you - which is not what I
requested.

Please let me know - and thanks,
Roeline

Deals YJ4705.1, YJ4707.1, and YJ7870.1 have all been rebooked to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.

Deal YJ7870.2 is already booked correctly;  the deal was done with BP Capital Equity Energy Fund, not the Internationl Holdings, L.P. entity.

Legal -

Attached below is an Omnibus Confirm worksheet for BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.   Please prepare the appropriate annexes and forward to the financial confirmations group as soon as possible.

 << File: BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1 Omnibus Confirmation.xls >> 



Financial Confirms -

Upon receipt of the credit annexes from Legal, please send out confirms for the following trades:

YJ4705.1		YJ7870.1
YJ4707.1		YJ7870.2

Please note that these trades are currently booked to BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P.  This is, obviously, not the correct counterparty name.  Please correct and send confirmations at your earliest convenience.




Derek and George -
 
I have Global Counterparty setting up this new entity in our systems.  Please ensure that these trades get moved from BP Capital Energy Equity Fund, L.P. to BP Capital Energy Equity International Holdings 1, L.P.  THIS IS CRITICAL.  Margin calculations are dependent on these trades being booked correctly.  While Mike Larsen has been very accomodating, our margin team can not afford to spend time reconciling trades at the present.



Thanks to all for your help.

Hi Marie,

Sorry to be a pain about this but our business people are very keen to
finalize this agreement and I wondered if you have any comments for me.

Thanks

Dear Marie,

I note from your email of 27 August that you were going to get back to
us with your further comments once Sara Shackelton returned from
vacation in September.

I wonder if you have now had a chance to discuss this issue with Sara
and if you have any feed back for me.

Thanks very much for your ongoing assistance in this matter.

Kind regards
Katryna

I thought you might be interested in knowing that effective 11/30/01, the SFA will cease to exist.  A new UK law on financial services becomes effective at that time and the SFA's regulatory powers will be transferred to the Financial Services Authority.  According to Jonathan Marsh, new FSA rules will be similar but not identical to the SFA rules.

Sarah:

Per my voice mail, attached is the "draft" guaranty for FIMAT (you have a hard copy).  I can't remember if I marked any other changes on ;your version that are not in the attachement.

I would let FIMAT know that Soc Gen just signed this version (except for the cap) in December, 2000.  I have a copy of it in my futures agreement file.

If you need any help finding this while I'm out, please call Marie Heard at X 33907.

Yes this deal is fine using the same credit terms as the old Petrotemex, SA de CV  transactions but now should read Grupo Petrotemex SA de CV.

Agustin Perez is wanting to send out a confirmation for YD9296.1 (currently booked to the old name Petrotemex, S.A. de C.V.) by this afternoon, if at all possible.

Do we have enough "lead time" to get this out today?

Marie, the counterparty just called and they are interested in closing their old bank accounts, but are concerned that we will continue to send it the the old bank account being that we have not moved the Pacifica Papers deals to Norske Skog.

Please let me know if you have heard from anyone.

It is my understanding that the companies mentioned above have been amalgamated, with Norske Skog Canada Limited retaining the name.  Are you aware that this occurred?  Norske Skog is wanting me to bill Pacifica Paper's swaps under Norske Skog's name going forward.

Please let me know!

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Paul, Matt and Edmund:

Attached is a copy of the Master Netting Agreement among BNP Paribas and Enron North America Corp., et al.  It is imperative that this master netting agreement be executed as soon as possible tomorrow morning (11/27), so I am asking your assistance in getting this document signed.  The UK entities to sign are EEFT, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited, Enron Credit Limited and Enron Metals Limited.  Please leave the signature pages as set forth on the attached document, as Enron Metals may be deleted from the agreement.  At this point, we aren't sure, so we will have it sign on a separate page and then if they are not a party to the agreement, we will omit their signature page.  

Please take whatever steps are necessary to have the attached document signed ASAP.  Harlan Murphy (713/345-2679 is the lawyer here in Houston who prepared the document.  Please contact either Harlan, Mary Cook (713/345-7732), Elizabeth Sager (713/853-6349) or Carol St. Clair (713/853-3989) if you have any questions.  Bill Bradford is the Credit contact and his number is (713) 853-3831.

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need to know exactly which Williams and British
Energy Power and Energy Trading Limited entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements.  Please let me know.  Also,
going forward, we will need this type of information for any new
counterparties added to the current list.  Thanks and please call with any
questions.

Best Regards,
Athena

P.S.  Please send me your telephone number.  Thanks!

Legal,

Per the request of John Malowney, please prepare an ISDA between Enron North America and West Linn Paper Company.  Kortney Brown or myself are you credit contacts.  Please note that all deals done with this counterparty need to be fully secured.


Thanks,

Nidia:

Thanks for your help with this.  Following is the list of entities that we
have transactions with on an monthly basis:

Enron North America	-	Natural Gas

Enron Gas Liquids 	- 	Propane & Butane

Transwestern Pipeline	-	We have a contract with you to use your
pipeline which creates a receivable for you at $125,000 per month.

All of these transactions are done with Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.
You had said that Sid Richardson Carbon & Gasoline was purchasing butane
from you, however that is incorrect.  Everything should be going through
Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.

We would like the ability to net out our exposures each month across all
Enron entities where we have activity.  I am told it is not something we
will necessarily do each month, but you like to have the option at least.
If you have any questions, please call me at 817-339-7410.

Best regards,
Bill Hayes
Richardson Energy Marketing, Ltd.

Sara,

Per your conversation with Phil Levy, attached please find our proposed
amendment to the Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement currently in
place between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  I
have reviewed the definition of "Specified Swap" as defined in Part 1(2) of
the Schedule and it does not appear to include foreign exchange
transactions.  Therefore, I have modified the definition in the amendment.

Please review the amendment and, if satisfactory, arrange for the execution
of two copies.  Both copies should then be returned to my attention at 270
Park Avenue, 40th Floor, New York, New York 10017.  In addition, once
executed, I would appreciate your faxing me a copy at 212-270-7368.  Once I
receive the originals and have them executed by Chase, I will return to you
one fully executed original for your files.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.  My
telephone number is 212-270-2673.

Best Regards,

Maureen Ryan

I don't know, all I know is that it was executed in order to get the master netting agreement done with Dynegy.  You might check with Marie Heard since she worked on the master netting agreement.

I called and left a message w/Steven Smith and response before I went out.  Robin Hill has the information -- not sure what the hold up is, Steven says it's b/c he is trying to find someone to sign the document, but that was almost two weeks ago.

I still haven't heard from these folks.  I talked to Steven Smith last week on 10/24/01 and he said there were no issues with the MSA, but he was having a hard time finding someone to sign it.  I told Jane this info last week.  I haven't heard back from him either via email or phone, should I pursue this further?  One more call before I go out on maternity leave?  I know Jane is anxious to get this back signed.

Please advise.

Thanks

Hi gang!
Hope all is well with you all.  Just thought I'd give you all an update on
our new home, that is if all the inspections go smoothly.  It's in Browns
Pt., 4602 41st St. to be exact, it's described as a super clean rambler, new
carpet, vaulted ceilings with fireplace in living room, kitchen has
nook,island, family rm, big fenced backyard which seems well landscaped to
my standards anyway.  It has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 car garage w/ opener!
We'll be closer to family, friends,Steve's work & hopefully have a better
sense of community for Queen Isabel.  We're excited to say that we're just
outside Tuscany, which is where a beautiful community lies with $300k & up
homes.  Can't wait to have you all over to unpack, clean, paint, babysit &
mow the lawn, so mark your calendars for Nov. 30th! This is also Steve's
34th birthday, hmmmm I think I'll buy him a house, don't ruin the surprise.
Take care,
Jennifer

Hi Marie -

I have been trying to get the paperwork back from Sempra, however, Eric
Twombly keeps saying he thinks all assignment documents were returned to
Enron, including my copy.  I cannot get a confirmation that this is so
though.

So I thought I'd better check with you - please let me know whether you have
the Sempra assignment documents.  Also I wanted to send you the documents
signed by us, UOM and Dynegy - so as to get it off my desk.

Hope all is well with you - especially with what has happened in the past
two weeks.  Things sure do change in a hurry, don't they?

Regards,
Roeline

Marie,

I have checked livelink and cannot find anything pertaining to BNP/EML.  Ed doesn't think there would be anything and I have a call out to Will Morley to check with him.

I will carry on searching.

Hi, Una:

Per my voice mail, we need a copy of a representative sample of whatever documentation BNP Paribas and Enron Metals Limited transact under (ISDA, general terms and conditions, etc.).  We are trying to finalize and sign a master netting agreement with them this morning and need to see this documentation as soon as possible.

My phone number is (713) 853-3907 and my fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!!!!!!!!!

Sara,
Thanks for your suggested changes.  I left the commercial support requirement on the account because I think it is a good control.  However, if you do want to remove this requirement because of shrinking staffs,  I am okay with that.  
Please change as required, initial and circulate for signatures.
Thanks. Sheila

Hi Marie,

As I referenced in my earlier e mail, I am in the process of reviewing the
AHC-Enron originals.  However, I noticed that I have not yet received a
faxed set of Authorizations from Enron for this ISDA.  As referenced in your
cover letter, could you fax these to me at your earliest convenience?  If
acceptable, you can than forward a set through the mail.

Thanks so much,

Justin & Paul,

We are seeking your sign-off and assistance in connection with a swap termi=
nation transaction that is part of an equity sale transaction that is prese=
ntly set to close this Thursday.  The good news is that the documentation h=
as been substantially negotiated by a number of internal and external lawye=
rs (in connection with the equity sale deal) and the swap termination deal =
terms have been discussed and blessed by Gary Hickerson's team in Houston.

The background and basics of the deal are as follows:

In March 1999 Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. ("ECTRI")=
 entered into a long-term interest rate swap with Greenfield Shipping Compa=
ny Limited ("GSCL") in connection with GSCL's project financing of a 135,00=
0 cbm LNG tanker.  The swap was documented by way of an ISDA Master Agreeme=
nt (Multicurrency--Cross Border) and related Confirmation (Deal No. M148198=
), both dated 18 March 1999 (the "Swap Transaction"), and ECTRI's obligatio=
ns under the swap were guaranteed by Enron Corp.  Enron, through its wholly=
-owned subsidiary Atlantic Commercial Finance Inc. ("ACFI"), owns a 20% int=
erest in Greenfield Holding Company Limited ("GHCL"), which in turn owns GS=
CL.  The LNG tanker was intended to be fully-employed in the transportation=
 of LNG to Enron's Dabhol, India facilities.

Due to an alleged default in GSCL's financing caused by the Dabhol project =
situation, GSCL's lenders' threats to accelerate the loan and foreclose upo=
n the vessel, and Enron's lack of desire to maintain an equity interest in =
the vessel, Enron (ACFI) now desires to sell its interest in GHCL to Mitsui=
 OSK Lines Ltd. ("MOL") [for US$5 million] and have the Swap Transaction te=
rminated and the Enron Corp. Guarantee released.  ACFI and MOL entered into=
 a conditional Sale and Purchase Agreement on  23 October 2001 which provid=
es for the described equity sale, swap termination and guarantee release.  =
An electronic copy of the signed Sale & Purchase Agreement is attached for =
your reference. =20

The key terms of the deal that relate to the Swap Transaction are as follow=
s: (a) the Swap Transaction is to be terminated (and GSCL's Banks are to pr=
ovide their consent thereto) on 15/11/01; (b) the assumed swap termination =
cost at 23/10/01 was US$20 million which was used as a basis for the Loan N=
ote calculation; (c) ECTRI is to receive US$4 million out of the sale proce=
eds as a down payment against the agreed swap breakage cost, with GSCL exec=
uting a Loan Note in favor of ECTRI for 80% of the balance of the agreed sw=
ap breakage cost (note that ECTRI has 20% of the upside/downside exposure i=
n the event the actual breakage cost varies from US$20 million [US$1 millio=
n for every US$5 million in actual break cost movement]), (d) the Loan Note=
 is to be guaranteed by MOL (Enron Houston Credit Dept. has signed off on M=
OL as an acceptable credit risk) and is to be fully repaid on the earlier t=
o occur of vessel refinancing or 30 April 2002; and (e) Enron Corp. is to b=
e released from its Guarantee obligations in respect of the original Swap T=
ransaction.  The swap is scheduled to be terminated at 9:30 am New York tim=
e on Thursday, Nov. 15.  The amount of the total breagage cost, as well as =
the Loan Note amount may then be calculated and inserted into documents (1)=
 and (2) referenced below.=20

John LaMaster and Mathew Kidwell of Vinson & Elkins represented ACFI, Ian A=
ndrews and Sabien Vermeulen of Linklaters represented GHCL/GSCL in connecti=
on with financing issues and Dan Bradshaw of Johnson, Stokes & Master (Hong=
 Kong) represented MOL.  GSCL's lenders are represented by a team led by Ha=
rry Theochari of Norton Rose.  Peter Anderson, Jordan Mintz and I worked on=
 the equity sale and swap break transaction and have cleared the terms of t=
he swap break transaction with Gary Hickerson and his team in Houston.  Jim=
 Hughes has also signed off on the terms of the equity sale and has agreed =
with Gary Hickerson as to how to internally handle any termination proceeds=
 shortfall.

I attach electronic copies of the following documents, for which we seek yo=
ur sign-off in connection with the equity sale transaction that is presentl=
y set for closing on this Thursday:

1.=09Swap Termination Letter Agreement between ECTRI and GSCL;
2.=09Loan Note 2002 made by GSCL in favor of ECTRI;
3.=09Deed of Guarantee made by MOL in favor of ECTRI;=20
4.=09Deed of Release made by GSCL in favor of Enron Corp.; and
5.=09Certificate of Assistant Secretary of ECTRI [required by GSCL's lender=
s].

Your assistance in signing-off on these documents, as well as helping to ob=
tain any necessary signatures of personnel based in London (I'm assuming th=
at  ECTRI's agent, Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited, must sign in Lon=
don) would be most appreciated.  Of course, I'm happy to respond to any que=
stions or comments you may have, but I'll be in transit to Tokyo for the cl=
osing on Tuesday.  Any of the listed lawyers at V&E and Linklaters would al=
so be happy to respond in my absence.  Sarah Bruck and Peter Anderson are c=
oordinating Enron's efforts from Houston and may also be reached in the eve=
nt you have any questions or need anything further.  Many thanks in advance=
 for the assistance and apologies for the short notice (until today we were=
 incorrectly assuming that this could be coordinated from Houston).

Spoke with Jeff Gollomp who is trying to obtain internal approval for financial trading with one of the operating utilities (as opposed to using the agent).  He anticipates a corporate restructuring which may delay matters. He understands our allocation concerns.  He inquired about AEP as a comparable type of counterparty but we did not attempt to discuss (and were not at liberty to discuss).  Jeff asked that I wait to hear from him.  By copy of this entry, I am advising Ed Sacks of the status.

All,

ENA has a new registered agent as of its February 2001 filing of a "Certificate of Change" with the Delaware Secretary of State.

As a result, I have updated those SWAP FORMS which include a "process agent" provision.  For your convenience, attached are REDLINED versions of the following documents:

	1.  Deemed ISDA

		 

	2.  Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement

Marie - per our conversation yesterday afternoon, attached are proposed drafts
of the Schedule and the Para. 13 relative to the above.  Having spoken with
Dennis Goldmann, I am advised that there are currently 2 Guaranties in place in
the sum of $8M each:  one by Niagara Mohawk Holdings Inc f/b/o Enron, and one by
Enron Inc. f/b/o Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing.  I am told that our respective
credit departments want to raise the credit lines to $10M for each party, but to
effect that we will have to modify the existing Guaranties accordingly.  Let me
know if this is your understanding, as well.

After you have had the chance to review the attached, please send me a marked-up
draft and we can discuss our concerns from there.

Should you have any questions, feel free to call me.  I can be reached at
315-460-3344.  Any credit concerns can be discussed with Dennis Goldmann, who
can be reached at 315-460-3349.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Patty Snyder

I'm just faxing it to you right now, so keep an eye out for it!

Just to let you know, I'm taking Monday off, so if you're looking for anything, you can e-mail Linda Sietzema, or if you can wait until Tuesday, I'll be happy to deal with anything then.

Thanks,
Sharon

Hi, Sharon!

Bet you thought you had heard the last from me.  Can you get me a copy of a physical gas master between ECC and Producers Marketing Ltd.?  Our Credit group gave me the document no. 96013847.

By the way, I received the BP Amoco documents.

Thanks!

Hi, Dana:

We have received the original copy of the ISDA Master Agreement.  In
looking through the supporting documents, we noted two outstanding
items:

1.	We did not receive an original signed IRS Tax Form W-9 as
required pursuant to Part 3(a); and

2.	The Certificate of Incumbency we received was not an original
and was dated November 14, 2000.  We would like to receive an original
certificate dated a current date.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact either
Frank or me.  We look forward to receiving this documentation.

Marie,

  I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?

  I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!

Funny you mentioned the David Jenkins thing--I just heard that this morning
and my ears perked up.  Whatever happened to the presumption of innocence?
Especially someone of David's standing who, as far as I know, has never been
in trouble?  You know what?  I haven't always agreed with Cindy on her
issues, but in this instance I'd sue for all I could!  That is just awful
and Monroe should be ashamed of himself.  Who the h..l does he think he is?
When Sheriff Otter was in office (and others too) the citizens of Chambers
County felt safe because you knew you were being protected by them, now you
want to know who's watching the Sheriff so the citizens can feel safe.  What
a mess!  This just goes to show what a little power can do to some people.

The tops to our kitchen cabinets and island are no more.  They demolished
all of that yesterday.  Robyn was so cute, 'cause she jumps up to the sink
for water and last night when she did, she almost fell into the hole.  She
can't figure it out--doesn't know what happened to her faucet!  It's
supposed to take 1-2 weeks to complete the granite; the painters are about
1/2 way?, I'm scheduled to have the carpet installed Wed., 10/31, and then
they have to do the floors.  We figure another 3-4 weeks before it's all
finished.

Friday when we got home it looked like the painters had put everything back
for the weekend, so Saturday I put a load of clothes on to wash and went
upstairs.  You guessed it!  The machine wasn't hooked up--water everywhere
downstairs.  I almost started crying.  I asked Marie what we had done that
was so bad that we were continuously being punished.  Anyway, it was just
one load of water, so we got it up.  Our contractor did send a guy over and
he came also.  He is really good--always available to you!

Gotta get back to work--tons to do.
Me

p.s.  We were at Marshall's Sunday and I bought Mama a pair of Easy Spirits.
Hope they'll fit.  They're a 10 and are black cloth-like.  Don't know how to
explain them, but hope I remember them the next time we see y'all.

p.p.s.  Thanks for Robbi's address and I'm copying Marie so she can get your
e-mail.

Hi!  How are things coming along with your house?
Have y'all been satisfied with the work?  Will they
lay the carpet in your room after they have completed
the kitchen work or right after they paint?  How much
longer will they be working?  I'm anxious to see
what's been done, and I'm sure you all are ready for
them to leave!  I tried to e-mail Marie about this,
but it was returned.  Go figure.  Oh, Mr. Pinchback
died last week - y'all probably saw his obit in the
Chronicle.  Also, L. J. Hall, Buddy's brother, died
last week.

Mama and I took the Buick to CarMax on the Gulf
Freeway Saturday, and they offered us $1,800.00.  On
the appraisal sheet, they didn't have one negative
thing to say about the car; only that it was "normal
for a car this age".  I drove Linda's car Sunday, and
she has 196,000 miles on her car and it's still going
great, so I don't see why 106,000 miles should be so
bad.  As long as you change the oil & filter
regularly, which we have, it should drive a lot
longer.  I don't know what we're going to do about it.
 We still owe you too much money to let it go for
that!  I still get mad everytime we pass Baytown
Buick, 'cause if they hadn't jacked us around, we
could have put it on the market before it reached
100,000 miles and still had some time on the warranty.
 I wish we were rich and could afford to take the
tires off, drain all the fluids, put it on blocks and
keep it until it becomes a classic since they aren't
making them anymore.  But, unfortunately, we ain't
rich!

Oh, did you hear about the guys who escaped from the
Liberty County Jail?  One was named David Jenkins, and
it seems as though Mr. Jenkins escaped several week
ago, too, and Liberty contacted Chambers County, and
our Sheriff's Deputies went to Winnie and kicked in
guess whose door?  Well, needless to say, it was the
wrong David Jenkins, and there's gonna be a lawsuit
over the mistake.  Supposedly David and Cindy have
hired Carl Parker and maybe an attorney from Houston.
Fun and games.  If they do file a lawsuit, I hope it's
after January so that we will get our fantastic $100
raise!

Well, gotta get back to work.  I'm working on an
Attempted Capital Murder of a Peace Officer jury
charge and needed to take a break.  I don't know what
the hell I'm doing!  Talk with you later.   Genia

I think Lance is working on some of the law suits.  He has some securities law reporters in his office.  He left his secretary a voice message at 1:45 am - so its something very urgent.

I bet Mary Nell was made that they wouldn't let her come back to Houston.  I haven't heard anything.  I know that several of our lawyers and Carol have been meeting to finalize a Master Netting agreement.  There are some issues with the master netting agreement and some of the big financing transactions.  Maybe that's what they are working on.  If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

Isn't it a big scam that these stores have!  The mark up is always between 40 and 50%, depending on the manufacturer.

Marie,
	Goldman needs an updated QIB letter from ECT Investments.  We normally update every year.  They need this doc before transferring the convert book.  I left a message with Sara since I've worked with her in the past on processing this type of documentation.  Please give her a call if you have any questions regarding the QIB (qualified investor buyer) form.

Thanks,

Tom:  Please forward your requisite email request to Donna Lowry, Rick Carson and Bill Bradford with your request and reasons.

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

Thanks.  Sara

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

Importance:	High

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

in the meantime (and don't shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEF

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

The Three Envelopes Of Success

  A giant corporation was struggling and hired a new
  CEO. The former CEO was kind enough to leave the
  new chief with three envelopes. "If and only if you
  run into problems and cant find a solution, use one
  on the three envelopes." The cocky young man
  thought nothing of it and threw the envelopes in
  his desk. About a year later the corporation began
  to lose profits and the new CEO had no clue how to
  turn it around. Seeking some kind of help, he
  remembered the envelopes. He noticed they were
  numbered 1 to 3 so he opened the first one.
  Inside it read "Blame it on your Predecessor". So
  he had a press conference and blamed the
  downfall on the former CEO. It dramatically turned
  around and profits boomed. Then about a quarter
  later they ran into some more trouble. Quick to
  find an answer, the young man opened the second
  envelope. It read "REORGANIZE". So he called yet
  another press conference and thought up a entire
  newly organized plan. Again everything was fine
  until about six months later when the bottom fell
  out again. The CEO didn't sweat it because he
  remembered he had another envelope. He hurried
  to the office and opened the last one. It said
  "PREPARE THREE ENVELOPES".

Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.

ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Jay,

Louis Dreyfus Energy Services LP wants to get in place a physical master netting agmt. for NGLs, currently Global Liquids doesn't have such type of document; maybe a master netting agreement will be sufficient for them.

FYI,
This customer also trades with us natural gas, NGLs, refined products, and crude oil through an ISDA with ENA.

Thanks,

Nidia

Nidia,

Thanks for speaking with me today about the possibilty of entering into a
master purchase and sale agreement for the ongoing NGL physical business
between our companies.

As we discussed, we would like to develop one set of terms to govern all
transactions that include a formal netting/ margining agreement.  As agreed
we will markup Enron's standard sale agreement to make it bilateral.  You
will let me know if Enron already has standard netting/margining language
that we can review.

Thanks Nidia, you've been really great these past few days.

Here is what I sent in August.  I am not sure what happened at the Board meeting, but Rex would probably know.  What normally happens is that he and JVD approve the final form after the meeting to make sure the resolutions conform to what the Board did or wanted.

Whether or not any resolutions should be given to Goldman is another matter: just because they want them would not be enough--there has to be a good reason to give them any final version.  

If you have any further questions, please let me know.

[Armogida, Jim]  attached is a redraft of the proposed resolutions which makes some cosmetic changes and updates somewhat the older form of these types of resolutions to make them more readable.  A marked copy showing revisions is also attached.  

I am sure these are in final form, but if in rearranging the resolutions I forgot something or left something out, please let me know.   Thanks.

Attached is a copy of the master netting assignments list that sets forth those that are signed and/or currently being worked on.  As you can see, BP Amoco, Dynegy and Reliant have recently been executed.  A master crude netting agreement has been signed with ConAgra.  Liquid payments netting agreements have been signed with Coastal, Conoco, Morgan Stanley, Sunoco and Valero.  Master Netting Agreements have previously been executed with PG&E, The New Power Company and Entergy-Koch Trading, LP.  

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Marie,
	I am forwarding to you the documentation Goldman would require regarding the Assignment and Assumption of the Convertible book from ENA to ECT Investments.  When we initially moved Convertible book from ECT Investments to ENA about a year ago, I believe we created our own legal templates based on the primebroker's documents.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.  I am hoping to get this completed by month end.  

Thanks,
Theresa

Individuals who have attained the level Vice President (or above) are authorized by the company bylaws to sign any contracts.  Thus Greg Hermans, Ray Bowen and Bob Crane would not need special authorization.  Brenda Herod and Lisa McClendon were authorized but have left the group so you might see some old confirms with their signatures.  I don't know anything about Debbie Nicholls.  

Marie, do you have any info on Debbie Nicholls?  Deb

Deb and Marie,
     Each of you provided me with a list of authorized confirmation
signatories earlier this month.  However, while reviewing the confirmation
documentation requested in conjunction with the paper and steel process
audit we notice that the individuals listed below were not identified on
the lists of authorized confirmation signatories we received.  Could you
please verify that the individuals listed below were authorized as
confirmation signatories during the period January 1, 2001 through August
31, 2001.  We would greatly appreciate it if we could receive this
documentation as soon as possible as we are attempting to complete the
process audit  by Monday, October 29, 2001.  If you have questions please
contact me at X56955.

1.  Greg Hermans
2.  Raymond M. Bowen
3.  Debbie Nicholls
4.  Robert Crane
5.  Brenda Herod
6.  Lisa McClendon

Thank you for your time and consideration.

      Hi Marie, 
      Our attorney has been on vacation most of this month, and 
   unfortunately, 
      we have not had the chance to review of your proposed ISDA documents. 
      Would it be possible for you to review our docs?  It will certainly 
   help 
      us out since we currently have a back log of unsigned ISDA contracts. 
      Please advise.

We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????

Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!!

Marie:

Pemex will by signing the guaranty, that will be either Juan Jos?
Suarez (CFO) or Jorge Lanz (Managing Director of Finance).  They will
be able to sign it once we get the final blessing from the Ministry of
Finance, they have to confirm that the guaranty does not represent
contingent public debt and therefore it does not require registration
with Hacienda.  We are checking everyday to make this happen as soon as
possible.
The guaranty cannot be dated as of January 1, 2001 as we got the
authorization from the Board in July this year, and we also need this
confirmatin from Hacienda to be prior to it?s execution.
As soon as we have it signed I will send you a fax, and the hard copy
will follow.

I will keep you posted,
Martha

How Enron Blew It=20
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz=
.php>>=20
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.

>From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20

You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=
gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=
n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=
2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil=
 in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =
York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=
ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=
sforming another.

"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.

"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."

Sorry

Mary/Francisco,

Please find attached the credit worksheet for G6 Energy Retailing, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Enersource Corporation.  Enersource Corporation will be the guarantor under this contract.  New guarantees need to be exchanged.  Please call with questions or comments.


 

Paul - Please be advised that the proposed terms are for discussion and negotiation purposes only as I am still waiting to here back from the counterparty on a few issued.  

Thanks
Wendy

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Dear Corporate Partner,

It's time for another J.Crew corporate event! (and just in time for
your holiday shopping.) From November 14th-18th, 2001, you and the
members of your company are invited to take 20% off everything in our
stores and online at jcrew.com. You missed our last event? Or you love
all our great new styles for yourself and everyone on your gift-giving
list? Here's your opportunity to get them: in our stores and at jcrew.com,
you'll find the season's best...and by clicking below, you'll find 
that extra little incentive, too.

To find your invitation, please visit the following URL, that you 
should forward to your colleagues.
jcrew.com/content/promos/F01/e5/corporate/corporatenight.jhtml?srcCode=YISN <http://click.jcrew.com/cgi-bin8/flo?y=hGmR0REFc0TH0NFM0AU>

You can also find this invitation in the attached Adobe Acrobat 
document. If you are unable to open the attachment, you can download 
Acrobat Reader at:
adobe.com <http://click.jcrew.com/cgi-bin8/flo?y=hGmR0REFc0TH0Ku0Av>

Here's the fine print: To receive the 20% discount, your employees can 
simply print the email/invite (please remember that you must have it in
order to receive the discount) and present it to the cashier at any of
our stores. Or, if they prefer to receive their discount online at
jcrew.com, they can simply enter the word "CORP1101" in the "redeem
coupon" box on the first checkout page. Please note that this discount
does not apply to online clearance items, or in our catalog.

Thank you so much for acting as the corporate contact for this event.
We hope that you and your colleagues will take advantage of this
invitation. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me
directly, either by email (garbarin@jcrew.com) or at (212) 209-8301.

Master Netting Group:

I just want to personally thank all of you for all of your hard work the past few weeks in addressing our counterparties' requests for Master Netting Agreements.  We have been able to sign up a number of them as a result of your efforts and have managed to keep certain counterparties from cutting us off in trading.  	Thanks again for your efforts and for putting up with one fire drill after another!  Hopefully we all learned alot in the process.

Marie--

I will get all of the copies pulled for you.  Also, I would like to have it reciprocated (so can I have a draft so that I can forward to ONEOK?).

Thanks--Veronica

Veronica:

There shouldn't be a legal reason why we can't do this, however, we will need copies of all the Enron Corp. guaranties (and any amendments thereto), together with details of all contracts that will be covered.  Also, has Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. provided any incoming guaranties and, if so, do we want to consolidate those?

Subject:	ONEOK Gty

Legal Team--

ONEOK Energy Marketing and Trading Company, L.P. would like to replace the current Gty's that Enron has issued to them and receive one overall gty to cover the financial and physical business with ENA, ECC, ENA Upstream Company, LLC, EPMI, EES and EGLI.  This would include the trading executed under the ISDA, GISB, and GTC's.  In executing this new gty, we would simultaneously cancel the existing outgoing Gty's that we have out to them already.  The cap amount on this new Gty would be $75MM.

Can you please advise whether this is acceptable or not so that I can tell the counterparty--we're currently avoiding posting cash on a Margin call as ONEOK will accept a higher Gty amount to cover their exposure.

Thanks,

Veronica

Marie, I do not believe that Enron Canada was involved in either of the prepays you have described below.  To my knowledge (and I have checked with Peter and he has confirmed), the only prepay deal that has been done by ECC or out of the ECC office was the Alberta Prepay dated September 28, 2000 among ECC, Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, ENA and Chase.  The obligation was retired on September 28, 2001.  I believe Tana has all of the relevant documentation relating to that deal.  However, we do not have any of the documentation relating to the two deals you reference below.

Thanks
Greg

Hi, Greg!

Mary Cook asked me to contact you regarding locating documents in connection with a couple of prepays.  The first is a prepay (December 13, 1999)  among ENA, Citibank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Toronto Dominion.  Is this Yosemite II?  If so, I have copies of the ISDA, swap confirms, etc.  Would you have copies of any other documents, or are there any other documents?  Also, they are looking for documentation in connection with the Corp. prepay for December 2000.  This was among ENA, Toronto Dominion, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley.  Do you happen to have copies of these documents or do you know the project name in case they were prepared here?

Thanks!

Marie

Mary Cook has requested that you attend a meeting tomorrow morning (Tuesday, October 30) from 10:00 to 11:00 in EB38C2  to discuss master netting agreements.

Marie,
	To recap our conversation, all Morgan needs to move Convertible book from ENA to ECT Investments is the Dupe Doc Letter document (attached) and the Assignment and Assumption letter.  The Journalletter2001 doc is not needed.  The Assignment and Assuption letter can be used instead.

Thanks,
Theresa

If they need help filling out the journal letter, I can prepare one
otherwise, they can do themselves.

Spoke with Ed Sacks who will approve the Service Company for online financial trading (and will switch to the utility if we ever execute the ISDA).  There will have to be special handling so Tana will be in the loop before the service company is approved on EOL financial.

Lucy:

Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes you
requested to the Guaranty we are working on:

1.	Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add that
"The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI".  Please explain.

2.	Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt of
the Payment Demand instead of 3 days.

3.	Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York Jurisdiction is
a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of derivatives
trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the "exclusive" jurisdiction
of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan.

The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
finalize this as soon as posible.

Best regards,

Martha Navarro

Hi, Edmund!

Can you help me obtain copies of some of your executed documents with BNP?  I need copies of the following:

1.	ECTRIC/BNPP ISDA

2.	Enron Credit Limited/BNPP ISDA

3.	ECTD /BNPP physical UK gas confirm (representative sample)

I hope you know who ECTD is cause I sure don't.  I am only assuming that because it's UK gas, it's a UK company.

My fax is (713) 646-3490.

Thanks for your help!

Tom:

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Thanks.

Sara

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Dear Marie,

I note from your email of 27 August that you were going to get back to
us with your further comments once Sara Shackelton returned from
vacation in September.

I wonder if you have now had a chance to discuss this issue with Sara
and if you have any feed back for me.

Thanks very much for your ongoing assistance in this matter.

Kind regards
Katryna

I think London is now saying they merely need to set up an accounting entity within ECTEF.  Should we need to move forward with the new account afterall I will happily send out the request.

Tom:  Please forward your requisite email request to Donna Lowry, Rick Carson and Bill Bradford with your request and reasons.

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

By the way, the Enron Corp. corporate database does not list a company with the name "Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments."

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

Subject:	Investment companies

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

The ENA transaction support team suggested ECTMI (Enron Capital Trade Merchant Investments) as one possibility.  There may be another US investment company and an investment company set up in the Netherlands.  The people to follow up with would be Faith Killen and/or Elaine Shields who work in ECT accounting.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

Regards,

Kevin

All of the EOL deals are included in this assignment. This assignment agreement template we have is EOL specific.  If you could forward us a template for non-EOL, we will take care of that deal separately, or you can adjust this agreement to account for all deals.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

The physical gas is not the problem....CAS is showing that financial deals have been booked with Duke Energy Marketing LP and ECC and also ENA.  Duke wants another ISDA so they beleive these trades exist too. Is the problem with the booking in our system or the confirming process or both? Physical trades will be with both entities as the agency agreement between ENA and ECC only applies to financial trades. We need to pull all of the financial trades with ECC and get to Mark Taylor's group today so that they can prepare an assignment of the ENA trades to the ECC master. Let's discuss.  Thanks for your help.

I ran three reports. One for Duke, Mirant, and Transcanada.  Looks like the issue is with Physical Gas.  I need to do a little more research in the a.m. to see what's going on.  I will let you know what I find out.

Transactions to be included:

ECTD/BNPP physical UK gas business

Bill does not want to include any of the brokerage agreeements.  Also, I beleive we have kept Metals out of everyhting thus far and should continue to do so.  One point of note in the document is section 2 BNPP appears to have modified the language such that the Non Defaulting party can cherry pick which agreements it wants to terminate - this is unacceptable. To be honest, I am going to need your help walking me through this document as they have changed so much I am unclear in many instances  what their changes accomplish.  Please advise.

Thanks,
Tanya

Dear Lech:

I have attached a version of the proposed Master Netting,  Setoff, and
Security Agreement between Enron Group and BNP Paribas Group,  subject to
BNP Paribas' review, along with a redline against Enron's form.   I have
also faxed the same to you at 212 945-2911.  We  would like to discuss the
draft with you tomorrow morning with a view to its  execution by tomorrow
afternoon.  Seth may be reached at 212 572-5317, and  I may be reached at
212 572-5398.

Yours truly,



David Rosen

Master Netting Group:

I just want to personally thank all of you for all of your hard work the past few weeks in addressing our counterparties' requests for Master Netting Agreements.  We have been able to sign up a number of them as a result of your efforts and have managed to keep certain counterparties from cutting us off in trading.  	Thanks again for your efforts and for putting up with one fore drill after another!  Hopefully we all learned alot in the process.

Attached is a copy of the master netting assignments list that sets forth those that are signed and/or currently being worked on.  As you can see, BP Amoco, Dynegy and Reliant have recently been executed.  A master crude netting agreement has been signed with ConAgra.  Liquid payments netting agreements have been signed with Coastal, Conoco, Morgan Stanley, Sunoco and Valero.  Master Netting Agreements have previously been executed with PG&E, The New Power Company and Entergy-Koch Trading, LP.  

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Marie,

  I just spoke to Robert Allen and they are going to send you a retun slip so that the 7 yards can be sent back via UPS without charge.  They have a 17 yard piece that they will ship to you.  I think the Houston show room screwed up the order - because I have a copy of what I sent them in writing - and it says 17 yards.  They have the 17 yards in stock so it shouldn't take long.  Just keep your eyes open for the return tag that they will send you in the mail for the 7 yards.  Ah -  the trials and tribulations of home decorating!

a few notes:  can we indicate that Reliant and Dynegy are executed. As is the Conagra master crude.Carolina Power & Light is really Progress Energy (netting among the subs of Progress Energy - CP&L, Florida Power Corp, and North Carolina Natural Gas).  Can we note that Southern is not an MNA but just power netting per Leslie's e-mail. Thanks!!

Har,

I'm reviewing the attachment you sent earlier today regarding the security
interest that was to be established under the Master Setoff Agreement.

Here are my revisions for the guaranty Enron provided to Dynegy.  If
acceptable, please incorporate these changes into the Amendment and have
two original execution copies signed on behalf of Enron.  After execution
on behalf of Enron, please send them to me.  I will have them signed on
behalf of Dynegy, and I will return one fully executed original to you for
Enron's files.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Thanks.

Ernie
