Hello!

We are the Elves in Black and we are having a Holiday Raffle in the Enron 
Lobby to raise money for the Analyst & Associate Adopt-A-Family Program. Our 
table is located near the big Christmas tree and the escalators that go up to 
the Energizer. We are selling raffle tickets, 1 for $1 or 6 for $5, December 
4-7 from 11:00-2:00. The prize is a Night on the Town: $100 Papas gift card 
and two tickets to the play, "A Christmas Carol" showing at the Alley Theatre 
on Sunday, December 17 at 7:30 PM. The winning ticket will be picked later 
this week. Even if your ticket is not picked, you are still a winner by 
helping support this great program!

For more information please contact Khrissy Griffin (5-4997).

Thank you, The Elves in Black

Effective immediately, there is a change to the Stack Manager which will 
affect Inactive Children.

Inactive Children with links to Parent products will not have their 
calculated prices updated until the Child product is Activated.

When the Child Product is activated, the price will be recalculated and 
updated BEFORE it is displayed on the web.

This means that if you are inputting a basis price on a Child product, you 
will not see the final, calculated price until you Activate the product, at 
which time the customer will also see it.

																	PG&E Reports Defective Steam Tubes 
																	
																	
																	
																	?  ? PG&E has reported to the NRC that 65 steam generator  tubes in its 
Diablo Canyon 1 nuclear unit in California were  defective but have been 
plugged and pose no safety threat. The  tubes, made from a special metal 
alloy, showed cracks from corrosion  and stress and were no longer in 
service. The tubes are part of the  No. 2 steam generator in Diablo Canyon 1. 
There are four steam  generators in each unit of the two-unit Diablo plant, 
and each  generator has 3,300 tubes. The tubes carry reactor coolant from 
the  reactor to the steam generators. If tubes are cracked, a small  amount 
of radioactive materials could leak into the unit's steam  cycle. The NRC 
limits the number of defective tubes to 15% of the  total in the steam 
generator, but a nuclear unit will begin to lose  power if the total reaches 
10%. Diablo 1 is in cold shutdown, but is  expected to link back up to the 
transmission grid in about a week,  when it will be at about 15% capacity. 
																	
																	
																	
																	
																	
																	
																																				
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												
																												BP  Buys Alliance Pipeline Capacity
																												
																												
																												? ?  BP Amoco has been acquiring transportation capacity on the Alliance  
pipeline as a prelude to shipping Arctic natural gas through Canada  to the 
US market. BP's Canadian unit was not one of the original  natural gas 
producers to back Alliance, the 1,900-mile?  pipeline set to transport up to 
1.325 Bcf per day to Chicago from  northeastern British Columbia in two 
weeks. But, over the past few  months, it has assumed the transportation 
responsibilities of eight  shippers on the pipeline whose volumes total about 
250 MMcf per day,  and it plans to increase that amount. Construction of one 
or more  pipelines connecting those Arctic pools across Canada's far north 
to  either Alliance or TransCanada PipeLines Alberta system is expected  to 
take at least five years. BP says that gaining capacity on  Alliance will 
eventually play into its Arctic natural gas strategy,  but in the short term 
it is broadening its asset management service.

																															Tnpc  Applies to Sell Power in Texas
																															
																															
																															
																															?  ? Tnpc, formed by Enron, is seeking approval from the Texas PUC  to sell 
power in the state. Tnpc's New Power wants to start  marketing to homes and 
small businesses early next year. Texas  hasn't deregulated yet, but is 
planning a pilot program next year  and will open its entire market to 
competition in January 2002.  Enron formed New Power in May. It has 285,000 
natural gas customers  and 20,000 power customers, mostly in Georgia, Ohio,

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

happening at the ThinkBank.   
What's your interest rate?  Come to the ThinkBank today.


Did you ask a question at the all-employee meeting last month that was not 
answered?  Take a look in eMeet.  We've posted responses to questions from 
the meeting, as well as another anonymous question to the Office of the 
Chairman.  See the "Office of the Chairman" category in eMeet.


Stop by the eSpeak Archives to see what was discussed in Cindy Olson's 
EnronOptions event.  Great questions, great answers.  They're all in the 
transcript on eSpeak.

Please join me in congratulating Paul Quilkey in his new role as Vice 
President leading our efforts in Australia.  Joe Hirl has assumed a leading 
role in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional 
responsibility for trading activity.

Paul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in 
Enron Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he 
has accumulated to date in his career with Enron. It is worth noting that 
Paul joined Enron as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short 
time since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his 
current Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a 
dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market, 
and far from Enron's traditional US markets. 

Please join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment. 

Rebecca

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available 
transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be 
submitted each 
for a partial amount of available transportation capacity under the specified 
package.? If 
the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such 
package of 
available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the 
same Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be 
discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest Rate 
x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is bid, 
the 
following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid 
Quantity x 
days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to 
improve its bid 
by submitting an improved bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such 
improved bid 
shall be faxed to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a 
tie still 
exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR

capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for 
the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is 
??????? less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? 
Bid Rate x 
??????? FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or

??????? to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still exists, such

??????? be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer

Mark,

We have been aware of this project for some time and have watched it with 
interest.

Questar just (within the last month) bought the development rights fully from 
Beta Energy.  They have drilled one salt test well and have extensively 
tested the salt.  They HAVE NOT tested the disposal zones as yet and that is 
a critical component.

They are planning on developing four caverns for a total of 14 Bcf working 
gas. First caverns should be available in about 2 years.  At that time they 
will abandon the three small reservoirs on their system and replace the 
deliverability and services with the Yellow Creek Facility.

We have initiated conversations with them regarding providing base gas as 
well as horsepower.

13:18 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Cal-ISO Pays $10M To Avoid Rolling Blackouts
Wed -Sources
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator paid
about $10 million Wednesday for 1,000 megawatts of power from Powerex and
still faced a massive deficit that threatened electricity reliability in the
state, high-ranking market sources familiar with the ISO's operation told
Dow Jones Newswires.
But the ISO fell short of ordering rolling blackouts Wednesday for the third
consecutive day.
The ISO wouldn't comment on the transactions, saying it is sensitive market
information. But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia
Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest
region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid
about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.
But that still wasn't enough juice.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts
of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of
$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts
of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the
$250/MWh price cap.
The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The
municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power
into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP
is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit
claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville
Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the
market at prices 10 times higher.
Powerex officials wouldn't comment on the ISO power sale, saying all
transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000
megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts
- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.
The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state
no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,
which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having
to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing
to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.
The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during
a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency
Wednesday, but wouldn't order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared
when the ISO's operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is
interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.
But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as
a means of attracting additional electricity resources.
"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,"
Dorinson said.
Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy
unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &
Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of
the high-priced power.
SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high
wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by
nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It's still unclear whether retail
customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity
rates or if companies will absorb the costs.

13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay
Pwr Plant
(This article was originally published Wednesday)
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent
System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy
Corp.'s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,
Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.
The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state
since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the
reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state's power grid since Monday,
7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the
ISO.
The ISO manages grid reliability.
As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert
at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would
dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid
collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn't result in rolling
blackouts.
The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).
Duke's 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives
in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.

   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said
Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by
some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate
reasons.
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public
Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power
plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,
ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.
The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for
unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency
for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and
customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be
called on to do so.
As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)
said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday
evening.
Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES
and Dynegy Tuesday evening.
AES told the visitors they couldn't perform an unannounced full inspection
of the company's 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday
morning, when the plant's full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron
Thomas said.
Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn't know whether the representatives
returned Wednesday for a full inspection.

   AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits

The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have
used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down
two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,
Thomas said.
AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire
Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos
and Redondo Beach plants.
The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES
has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the
company $20 million for polluting.
"We'd be happy to put our units back, provided we don't get sued for it,"
Thomas said. "It's not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality
district's" authority.
As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES
could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off
line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.

   Dynegy's El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC

Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday
evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line
Wednesday.
"I guess our position is, 'Gee, we're sorry you don't believe us, but if you
need to come and take a look for yourself, that's fine,'" said Dynegy
spokesman Lynn Lednicky.
Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and
the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could
pose a safety hazard if not repaired.
"We've been doing all we can to get back in service," Lednicky said. "We
even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited."
Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy's explanation of
why its units were off line.

Subject: New Generation as of Oct 24th



As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
 
The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
access to in the WSCC:

 1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
 2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
 3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
 4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan

If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.

Hi Richard.  I was just wondering if you sent this to me because of my recent

Please join me in congratulating Paul Quilkey in his new role as Vice 
President leading our efforts in Australia.  Joe Hirl has assumed a leading 
role in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional 
responsibility for trading activity.

Paul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in 
Enron Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he 
has accumulated to date in his career with Enron. It is worth noting that 
Paul joined Enron as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short 
time since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his 
current Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a 
dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market, 
and far from Enron's traditional US markets. 

Please join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment. 

Rebecca

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We plan to upgrade the two NT servers that run Gas TDS's middle-tier 
applications this weekend.  Therefore, TDS will not be available between 
12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 10th, 2000.  If this downtime is 
in conflict with your schedule, please let me know ASAP.

I would also like to point out to you that when TDS is brought back on line, 
it will be necessary for all the desks to be reloaded.  Since we introduced 
the TDS Flag last month, this should not effect any of the desks.

Thank you for your cooperations,
Kenny H.

We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline=
=20
website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessar=
y=20
to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached=
=20
file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below i=
s=20
the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut k=
ey=20
that is mapped to the same function:



1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change fr=
om=20
a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a=
=20
specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic=20
price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and=
 a=20
suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the=
=20
mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend functi=
on=20
to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered. =20
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended on=
ce=20
a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be=
=20
available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today=01,s Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today=01,s=
=20
Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order.=20

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded=
=20
or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area an=
d=20
select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each=
=20
set of =01&zeros=018 for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

																Total to Build Deep-Water Gulf of 
																Mexico Gathering System
																
																
																? ? TotalFinaElf plans to construct a natural gas  gathering project with its 
north American partners in the Gulf of  Mexico, enabling the development of 
three deep offshore natural gas  fields. The project consisted of a 56-mile 
pipeline with a  transmission capacity of 500 MMcf per day and a processing 
platform,  owned and operated by Williams.? Construction of the Canyon  
Express pipeline, in the Mississippi Canyon area about 120 miles  southeast 
of New Orleans, will begin next year. The gathering system  will begin 
operating in summer 2002, at the same time as the three  natural gas fields, 
Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden Hills. Canyon  Express was a major 
technological breakthrough for TotalFinaElf,  making it possible to undertake 
oil and natural gas operations at  previously untapped depths of over 6,000 
feet. The gas gathering  system will be operated by Elf Exploration and 
belong to the  companies who owned the Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden 
Hills  fields. Aconcagua is operated by Elf Exploration which has a 50%  
stake in the field. Enron affiliate, Mariner Energy, and Pioneer  Natural 
Resources each own 25%. King's Peak is wholly-owned and  operated by BP 
Amoco. Camden Hills is operated by Marathon, with a  50% stake. Total 
Exploration Production USA owns 16.67% and Pioneer  owns 33.3%. Aconcagua 
will own 45%; King's Peak, 35%; and Camden  Hills 20% of the Canyon Express 
pipeline.

Foothills Pipe Lines while Arctic Resources is promoting the  Beaufort Sea 
route. The North Slope has natural gas reserves of over  35 Tcf, and many 
believe the potential reserves could exceed 100  Tcf. Currently, oil 
producers produce about 8 MMcf per day of  natural gas and re-inject almost 
all of it into oil reservoirs to  build up pressure there and enhance future 
recovery.

																					Public Offered Units of Williams 
																					Energy Partners
																					
																					
																					
																					?  ? Williams will offer the public a 32% stake in its Williams  Energy 
Partners petroleum storage and distribution partnership.  Williams Energy 
Partners filed with the SEC to register 3.75 million  common units, which 
will be listed on the NYSE under the symbol  'WEG'. Williams will own 68% of 
the Williams Energy partnership  after the sale. The partnership consists of 
four petroleum products  terminals along the Gulf Coast and the New York 
harbor, 24 inland  petroleum product terminals and an ammonia pipeline. 
Lehman Brothers  will underwrite the sale which is expected to begin next 
January.  The estimated total proceeds would be about $90 million if the  
underwriters exercise an option to sell an additional 562,500 units  if 
needed to meet investor demand. If that overallotment option is  
																					
																					
																					
																					
																																									
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																
																																exercised, the public would have a 37% stake in the  partnership. The four 
marine terminals have a storage capacity of  more than 17.6 million barrels. 
The 1,100 mile-long pipeline  transports and distributes ammonia from 
production facilities in  Texas and Oklahoma to various distribution points. 
Ammonia is  produced from natural gas and is used primarily as a nitrogen  
fertilizer. Williams did not name an individual price for the common  units. 
It would expect to receive net proceeds of about $70 million  from the sale 
of the 3.75 million common units, based on a?  unit price of $20. WEG will 
use the proceeds, together with $90  million from its line of credit, to 
repay $156 million of debt owned  to Williams. Williams Energy will offer 
holders of the units a  quarterly distribution of $0.52 per unit each 
quarter. Last week,  Williams said third-quarter profit more than quadrupled, 
beating  estimates.

																																		DTE,  MCN Merger to Close Next Year 
																																		
																																		
																																		? ?  DTE Energy Holding says it is unlikely that the merger with MCN  Energy 
Group will close this year. The delay is due to the  companies' decision to 
sell a portion of MCN's natural gas  distribution capacity to a unit of 
Exelon, which is subject to  Michigan PSC review.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Effective November 21, 2000, there will be a new procedure for lunch.  EOL 
traders and deskheads will eat first.  Then, your assistant will notify you 
when the rest of the traders can eat.   This new procedure is to ensure the 
EOL traders will not be away from their desk a long period time during 
lunch.   

Thank you for your cooperation.

On-Line Natural Gas Reverse Auction

? ? 
The East Coast  Natural Gas Cooperative has secured over 25 Bcf of natural 
gas for  several Northeast distributors in an auction that worked in 
reverse.  For the first time, the ECNGC staged a reverse auction where it is  
the potential sellers who bid - downward - to win a sale to a buyer.  Nearly 
50 packages of natural gas demand were on the procurement  block at various 
times during the 4-day auction period, conducted  last week.

delivery was up across the US and Canada yesterday as  the cash market 
followed the futures rally. Natural gas for next day  delivery at the Henry 
hub rose $0.11 to $4.47 per MMBtu. Cash prices  have fallen to a sharp 
discount to futures, as heating demand is  expected to increase in December.

																				NEB  Releases Energy Market? Assessment 
																				
																				? ?The National Energy Board has released its  latest in a series of Energy 
Market Assessment? reports  entitled Canadian Natural Gas Market Dynamics and 
Pricing. The  report identifies the factors that affect natural gas prices 
and  describes the current functioning of the regional gas markets in  
Canada. The Board's report concludes that Canada has become part of  an 
integrated North American natural gas market. Natural gas can be  bought from 
many supply sources and delivered to any market centre  through an extensive 
North American pipeline grid. With the  increased integration of the markets, 
regional supply and demand  forces are felt throughout the marketplace. It 
also says that a  combination of strong economic growth in North America, a 
preference  for natural gas fired electricity generation, and low natural 
gas  prices led to sustained growth in demand throughout the 1990s.  However, 
the growth in natural gas supply has lagged during the last  few 
																				
																				
																				
																				
																				
																																									
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	years. This is primarily attributable to the low oil price  environment of 
1997/1998 which reduced cash flow for the producing  sector. In turn, 
drilling activity decreased throughout North  America. Since demand growth 
has outpaced supply growth, natural gas  prices have increased significantly 
over the last year. With oil  prices recovering sharply in 1999/2000, the 
producing sector has  responded and drilling activity is at high levels. 
Despite the  drilling activity, there is a lag between developing additional 
gas  supplies and connecting those supplies to the market. In time, there  
will be a supply and demand response and accompanying relief in  natural gas 
prices is expected. A period of market adjustment is  necessary any time the 
dynamic between supply, transportation and  demand is significantly changed. 
It is difficult, if not impossible,  to predict with certainty any movements 
in the commodity markets.  The Report found that recent increases in the 
commodity

																						agreed governments will promote more trade and investment,  70% agreed that 
globally consistent accounting principles will be  established by 2010, and 
over 80% believed the companies dominating  the utility business in 2010 will 
be multi-national. Those results  validate the strategies of companies using 
mergers and acquisitions  to create global giants. However, events such as 
the IMF protests in  Prague and WTO protests in Seattle this year highlight 
what could be  growing opposition to globalization. Politics can veer off in  
unexpected directions, so it is unwise to be so committed to any one  view of 
where voters and government policy are moving that you lack  contingency 
plans. Utilities can minimize their risk in this  uncertain era, while at the 
same time moving forward decisively.  They can use management tools such as 
scenario-based planning, real  options valuation, and computer modeling - 
these approaches provide  the means 
																						
																						
																						
																						
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			
																																			for understanding the array of strategies available and for  defining the 
significance of choosing one or the other.  Additionally, the studies show 
that utilities need systems,  processes, and a culture that make them 
versatile - that permit them  to nurture 'just-in-case' technologies, 
products, and businesses,  spot leading indicators of change, and switch 
strategies without  confusion and delay. The two reports are segments of The 
Utility  Executive's Field Guide to the Future. Part 1 summarizes the 
results  of a global survey of 185 decision makers in utilities,  
corporations, and engineering firms in 15 countries, while Part 2  focuses on 
the outlook for regulatory policy and globalization. Part  2 is based not 
only on the survey results but also on 75 subsequent  interviews with utility 
CEOs, power managers in large corporations,  government officials, and others 
around the world. The research also  included an intensive review of economic 
studies, government  reports, opinion surveys, and other sources. For more

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=

EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20

																																	Consultant Says Mexico to Pay Billions for Natural Gas  
																																	
																																	
																																	? ?  Mexico, over the next decade, will likely need to spend $40.6  Billion 
to import natural gas, given Pemex's failure to conduct  adequate capital 
investment, consultants Consultores Internacionales  have said in a report. 
The estimate assumes an average price for  natural gas of $4.50 per MMBtu 
over the period. In a more  conservative scenario, with the average price of 
natural gas at  $3.50 per MMBtu, the country over the next 10 years would 
need to  spend $31.6 billion dollars on natural gas imports, according to 
the  report. Under both scenarios, estimates expect that Mexico will need  to 
import 24.7 Bcf of natural gas during the coming decade.

																																				September Canadian Natural Gas Sales
																																				
																																				
																																				Natural gas sales totaled 4.22 billion cubic meters in  September, up 10.2% 
over September 1999. The increase was the result  of increased demand by the 
industrial and residential sectors. Use  by the industrial sector rose 11.7%, 
amid higher use of natural gas  for electricity generation and stronger 
demand by the chemical  industry. Year-to-date sales were up 7.1% over the 
same period in  1999. Industrial sector sales continued to grow strongly, 
posting an  11.1% increase. Consumption by the residential sector increased 
1%,  while the commercial sector decreased 1.1%.

? 

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total 
available transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple 
rates can be 
submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation capacity 
under the 
specified package.? If the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest 
present value 
for such package of available transportation capacity shall be considered the 
valid bid. 
All other bids from the same Shipper for the same package of transportation 
capacity will 
be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
??????? minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest Rate 
??????? x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate 
is bid, the 
??????? following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x 
Maximum Bid Quantity x 
??????? days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right 
to improve its bid 
??????? by submitting an improved bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? 
Such improved bid 
??????? shall be faxed to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick 
Aman.? If a tie still 
??????? exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than 
??????? indicated?????? for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

PROS Revenue Management Announces Record Third Quarter and Year-to-Date 2000

Major milestones, company records and client successes achieved

October 30, 2000-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in 
revenue management science and software, and the pioneer and dominant 
provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today 
announced that the third quarter of 2000 was the company's most successful 
yet, with record revenues and profits. Third quarter revenue for 2000 was a 
50% increase over the third quarter of 1999. Year-to-date revenue for 2000 
approximates the full year revenue for 1999. Additionally, the first nine 
months of 2000 were cash flow positive and enhanced PROS' strong balance 
sheet. This follows record annual revenues and profits for 1999.

"During the third quarter of 2000 we achieved successful results in many key 
areas. Most important were science breakthroughs in network demand 
forecasting, scientific selection of inventory for e-commerce, and 
customer-centric revenue management. Another milestone was the production 
cutover of our first energy products," says Bert Winemiller, Chairman, 
President and CEO of PROS Revenue Management. "Our goal is to be the first 
mover in a major new category of revenue management and we have the talent 
and financial resources to achieve this goal. The third quarter of this year 
proved to be another landmark with record revenues, record profits and the 
launch of new products in the energy market."

Major milestones of 2000 include:

* The PROS 8th Annual Conference held in October was a huge success and is 
the largest revenue management conference in the world, with industry 
leaders, analysts and representatives from over 70 companies attending.
* In the airline industry, PROS completed signed contracts with airline 
companies AirTran Airways, Avianca, Continental Airlines, China Southern 
Airlines, Gulfstream International, LanChile, Philippine Airlines, Swissair, 
Thai Airways and Virgin Atlantic.
* Contracts were signed in the energy, rail, healthcare and broadcasting 
industries, including a major US gas pipeline company, German rail line 
Deutsche Bahn, one of the top ten pediatric hospitals in the world, and TV 
Azteca, one of Latin America's largest broadcasting companies.
* PROS announced its first Application Service Provider (ASP) contracts for 
the healthcare and the energy industries.
* PROS posted a record backlog as of September 30, 2000, and a record number 
of contracts signed in one year.
* The PROS Advisory Board was formed in June, and consists of many industry 
leaders.
* PROS announced a new e-commerce product, eCustomerRevenueManagement.
* PROS' new Technical Services Group was formed, enhancing customer service.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,
Enron Global Messaging Team

The scheduled Station 3 maintenance has caused a restriction greater than
anticipated.  For that reason, the Kingsgate capacity will be further
limited to 2220 MMcf/d beginning with the Intra-day 1 cycle for Gas Day 4/26
and will remain in effect until further notice.

If you have any questions, please call our transportation coordinators at
(503) 833-4300.

		 Subject: Questar Pipeline's Southwest Wyoming Storage Project Open Season


Questar Pipeline Company is holding an open season to determine the 
feasibility of constructing a salt cavern storage facility near Evanston, 
Wyoming to provide firm natural gas storage service.  This facility will 
provide multiple cycle, high deliverability storage service that will be 
connected to several interstate pipelines.

All interested parties are invited to submit requests during the open season, 
which will begin on Wednesday, May 2, 2001 and close on Friday, June 1, 
2001.  Depending on customer interest and the scope of the project, the firm 
storage is anticipated to be in service by June 1, 2004.

A description of the open season, including application requirements, is 
attached to this message in Microsoft Word format.  The Precedent Agreement 
form is also attached as an Adobe Acrobat PDF file.  The Precedent Agreement 
must be completed and e-mailed or faxed to Questar Pipeline by 5 p.m. on 
Friday, June 1, 2001.   Questar Pipeline's fax number is (801) 324-2980.  
Precedent Agreements for the storage service should be faxed to Attention:  
Tom Myrberg.

If you are unable to open the PDF file containing the Precedent Agreement and

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

updated notice will be posted to the EBB as soon as possible.

UPCOMING DECEMBER? SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE 

*** November 27, 2000 - December 15, 2000 

20" Camas - Eugene Pigging Project 

Due to permit issues imposed by the City of Gresham, anomaly repair work on 
the 20" Camas - Eugene line has been delayed from the original repair date of 
October 23 & October 31, 2000, until the week of November 27, 2000 through 
December 15, 2000.? It is not known at this time if any pipeline anomalies 
will require repair. The 20" Camas to Eugene is paralleled by a 30" / 20" 
loop line and no impacts are anticipated at this time.


*** November 10, 2000 - December 8, 2000 

Vernal Pigging Project 

WGP-W crews continue to excavate and repair anomalies between mainline valve 
2-7 
(M.P. 213) to mainline valve 2-10 (M.P. 263). Based on current data, it is 
not known how 
many pipeline anomalies will require repair.? Gas outages may be required 
during this period 
and will be communicated as quickly as the information becomes available.

As a result of these two factors, we are making the following organizationa=

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
entering into 
the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity and 
shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's transmission system without impacting the discount for the 
original shipper.

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition to the 
Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the 
applicable 
surcharges and fuel. 

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available 
transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be 
submitted each 
for a partial amount of available transportation capacity under the specified 
package.? If 
the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such 
package of 
available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the 
same Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be 
discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest Rate x The 
Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is bid, the 
following formula 
is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days 
bid/100. In case 
of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to improve its bid by 
submitting an improved 
bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed 
to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still 
exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis.

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated 
for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

Hi-

Frank - done some checking on the rockies / San Juan selling and it does not 
seem to be producer driven.  Last time we talked you mentioned 5/day selling 
right before the AGA last week- was not clear if that was Rockies or SJ.  Rus 
and I just wanted to clarify what has been done- Rus told me about the deals 
Friday- it looks like BP Amoco is selling SJ and buying Rockies?

My thoughts are that this might have something to do with BP Amoco taking 
over IGI Resources - IGI was Bankers biggest single client so that might be 
the tie in with their selling- I have a call into IGI and will try to get 
them today.

In the meantime, we need to have a call with Tudor to let them know what is 
going on (as you can see form the above, I am a little confused) and 
hopefully we can get some info from them to see what else is in store.

We are going to shoot for this afternoon.

Rgds,
Caroline

EnergyGateway.com Allows Producers Variable Levels of  Service Online? 

? ?
? ?  EnergyGateway.com, an  e-community that offers customized energy 
transactions among  suppliers and consumers, has announced a new program that 
will allow  natural gas producers to transact online under variable or  
interruptible levels of service in addition to firm service  specifications. 
EnergyGateway.com lets the producer choose its level  of service when the 
offer is made, including swing, interruptible  and firm service. This lets 
buyers and sellers transact for any term  and is not simply a day-trading 
tool. Allowing more producers to  compete online can only add to the 
transaction savings achieved by  participants. To create an optimum portal 
for buyers and sellers, we  must have direct contact with the producer 
community in order to  meet the needs of our customers. This program can

? ? 
Canada's Cabre  Exploration has agreed to sell its northeastern Alberta

																													Alberta's Oil and Natural? Gas Revenue Doubles  
																													
																													
																													
																													?  ? Alberta's revenue from oil and natural gas will more than  double this 
year to about C$8.7 billion. It will use most of the  money to cut its debt. 
Alberta, the biggest international supplier  of natural gas to the US, will 
pay down its debt by C$4.5 billion  this year and give residents C$485 
million in tax and energy-bill  rebates. Alberta is expecting a C$4.2 billion 
budget surplus in the  fiscal year ending March 31. Alberta collects a 
percentage of  revenue from oil and natural gas produced in the province. 
The  province's debt, now around C$12.5 billion, rose when prices were  low. 
Alberta's low debt and its repayment program have earned it the  highest 
credit rating of any Canadian province.

																														Canadian 88 Losses Increase
																														
																														? 
																														
																														?  ? Canadian 88 Energy, which has put itself up for sale, says  its third 
quarter loss widened seven-fold because of production  problems and an 
ill-fated natural gas hedging program. It reported  the loss grew to C$5.2 
million. Cash flow, a key indicator a firm's  ability to fund future 
exploration, fell 64% to C$2.3 million from  C$6.4 million. The third quarter 
results reflected the one-time  impact of the upgrading program at the Olds 
Gas Plant, which  shut-in? 26 MMcf per day of natural gas and 770 barrels of  
liquids daily from September 5th until October 7th. Most Canadian  firms have 
been big winners in the natural gas market, but not  Canadian 88, whose 
natural gas hedging reduced cash flow by $26  million in the quarter.

Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such package of 
available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the same Shipper for the same package of transportation 
capacity will be discarded.

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? 
Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; 
or if the maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, 
each tied shipper will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an 
improved bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall 
be faxed to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie 
still exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis.

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
Transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available transportation capacity under the specified package OR 
multiple 
rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation 
capacity under the specified package.? If the same Shipper submits multiple 
bids, 
the highest present value for such package of available transportation 
capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for 
the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate 
is less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid 
Rate 
x FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the 
maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest 
Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied 
shipper 
will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid within 
24 
hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed to (801)

shall 
be awarded on a prorata basis.

We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.  I 
will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate 
from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.  I will probably have to go get 
the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my 
share of the bill. ( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to 
iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <
mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>.

																									Concamin to Propose NewRegulated Natural Gas Price  Scheme
																									
																									? ? 
																									? ?  Leading Mexican business association, Concamin, will propose that  Pemex 
adopt a new scheme for determining the price of natural gas.  The details of 
the proposal were finalized at a Tuesday night  meeting of Concamin's Energy 
Committee. Pemex currently uses the  price of gas in southern Texas as a 
price of reference in setting  the price of natural gas in Mexico. Under the 
scheme to be proposed  by Concamin, the price of natural gas would be 
determined with  reference to the costs of extraction, exploration, supply 
and  distribution, plus a reasonable profit margin for Pemex.

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
entering into 
the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity and

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition to the 
Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the 
applicable surcharges and

? 

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available 
transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be 
submitted each 
for a partial amount of available transportation capacity under the specified 
package.? If 
the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such 
package of 
available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the 
same Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be 
discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest Rate x The 
Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is bid, the 
following formula 
is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days 
bid/100. In case 
of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to improve its bid by 
submitting an improved 
bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed 
to 
(801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still exists, 
such capacity 
shall be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated 
for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

Please refrain from running reports on the EnronOnline databases between 7 am 
- 2 pm CST / 1pm - 8pm GMT, which is our peak usage period.

These reports slow down EnronOnline trading.

We will have a solution to this problem within the next few weeks, but in the 
meantime, we appreciate your cooperation with the above.

 a=20

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=

=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=

current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20

=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=

>Our good buddy Bill Clinton was assigned a new intern named Sally. Being
>the
>polite gentleman he is, Bill went to visit Sally and ask her if she needed
>any questions answered. She said no, so Bill asked, "Have you seen the
>presidential clock yet?"
>
>Sally replied, "I haven't even heard of the presidential clock."
>
>Bill then replied, "Well let's go to my office, so I can show it to you."
>
>Sally was a little taken aback, and she stated, "With all the problems
>you've had lately, I don't think we should."
>
>Then Bill said, "Ahh, it's just a clock and I promise I won't try
>anything."
>
>Sally then agrees to go with him.
>
>Bill leads her to the Oval Office, shuts and locks the door behind them and
>then drops his pants to the floor. Sally is flabbergasted and says, "Mr.
>President, that is the presidential cock, not the presidential clock."
>
>Bill looks at her and says, "Sally, by my definition, if you put two hands
>and a face on it, it's a clock."

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
??????? entering into the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity 
and shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's transmission system without impacting the discount for the 
original shipper. 

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition 
to the Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR

rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation 
capacity under the specified package.? If the same Shipper submits multiple 
bids, 
the highest present value for such package of available transportation 
capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for 
the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is 
??????? less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? 
Bid Rate x 
??????? FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or 
if the

FERC Interest 
??????? Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each 
tied shipper 
??????? will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid 
within 24 
??????? hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed to 
(801) 584-7076 
??????? to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still exists, such 
capacity shall 
??????? be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer

																					US  Negotiates at Climate Meeting 
																					
																					
																					? ?  At the UN conference in the Hague, environmental groups are accusing  
the US of seeking loopholes to avoid cutting pollution. The  conference 
opened to set rules for reducing harmful gases released  into the atmosphere. 
One major issue revolved around how much  countries could trade off against 
their commitments to roll back  their own pollution by helping other 
countries reduce theirs or by  planting new forests to absorb greenhouse 
gases. The US advocates  unlimited emissions trading, but the EU and some 
developing  countries fear it will defeat the effort to force the biggest  
polluters to change their ways. The US argues that emissions trading  is the 
most cost-effective way to meet the global target of reducing  greenhouse 
gases by 5.2% from 1990 levels, and would give time for  the transition to 
cleaner energy and expensive new technologies.  About 6,000 bureaucrats, 
scientists, environmentalists and  businessmen attended the opening. That 
number was expected to grow  to 10,000 during the second week with the 
arrival of 100 government  ministers for the culmination of negotiations. 
Months of talks have  preceded the conference. Three years ago at Kyoto, 
governments drew  up targets for rolling back emissions of carbon-based gases 
but  could not agree on the details. Europe agreed to cut emissions by  8%, 
the US by 7% and Japan by 6%. Each was allowed to decide how it  would make 
the required reductions. So far, 30 countries have  ratified the Kyoto 
Protocol. Mexico is the most industrialized  country on the list, and none is 
among the heaviest polluting  countries. The agreement needs the ratification 
of 55 countries,  representing at least 55% of the harmful emissions, before 
it will  come into force.

data yet, but they trust your explanation, which is why they're anxious to 
start building a position.
Thanks,
Russ

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.

STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicaliti=
es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20
to capital.

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS
FuelCell Energy, Inc. recently announced that it has entered into an allian=
ce=20
with ENA.  FuelCell Energy and Enron will work together to develop and mark=

Sorry guys, but you will not be migrated until Tuesday, May 1st after 
hours.   The reason being they want the pilot runners (Steve South & Susan 
Scott) on their machines a few more days before they migrate everyone else 
over.  The migration team wants to make sure there will not be any problems 
with everyone's applications.

SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS 

1. The discount rate shall apply to points utilized by the original shipper 
entering into 
the transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity and 
shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's transmission system without impacting the discount for the 
original shipper.

3. This prearranged offer is for a reservation contract demand rate.? In 
addition to the 
Reservation Charge Bid, shipper will pay the volumetric charge, the 
applicable 
surcharges and fuel. 

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation 
capacity for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available 
transportation capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the 
total available 
transportation capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be 
submitted each 
for a partial amount of available transportation capacity under the specified 
package.? If 
the same Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such 
package of 
available transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All 
other bids from the 
same Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be 
discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest Rate x The 
Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is bid, the 
following formula 
is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days 
bid/100. In case 
of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to improve its bid by 
submitting an improved 
bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved bid shall be faxed 
to (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still 
exists, such capacity shall be awarded on a prorata basis.

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated 
for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

I would like to remind you that only postID of calcs that have TDS Flag (in 
Port Calc screen) set to "1" are included in TDS position load.  We have 
noticed that ST-Bammel, ST-Bridgeline, GD-Texas,... and many more desks do 
not have the TDS Flag set to "1".

Please call me (x30413) or Bill Kasemervisz (x57579) if you have any 
questions.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

entering into the 
transportation agreement with Northwest. 

2. A shipper will be allowed to release and/or segment and release the 
capacity and 
shipper and replacement shipper may utilize any available points on 
Northwest's 
?transmission system without impacting the discount for the original shipper. 

3. This prearranged offer is a volumentric reservation contract demand.? A 
monthly base 
reservation charge per unit of transportation contract demand shall be the 
awarded 
rate/dth multiplied by the dth's delivered during the month, divided by the 
total 
monthly Transportation Contract Demand.? In addition to the Volumetric

PROCEDURE FOR BIDDING FOR 
AVAILABLE TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY 

The following guidelines will be adhered to for all posted packages of 
transportation capacity 
for electronic bid ("package or packages"): 

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available transportation 
capacity.? Multiple electronic bid(s) can be submitted for the total 
available transportation 
capacity under the specified package OR multiple rates can be submitted each 
for a partial 
amount of available transportation capacity under the specified package.? If 
the same 
Shipper submits multiple bids, the highest present value for such package of 
available 
transportation capacity shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids 
from the same 
Shipper for the same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is less than 
??????? minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest Rate x The 
??????? Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the maximum rate is 
bid, the following 
??????? formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC Interest Rate x Maximum Bid 
Quantity x days bid/100. 
??????? In case of a tie, each tied shipper will have the right to improve 
its bid by submitting an 
??????? improved bid within 24 hours of the bid close time.? Such improved 
bid shall be faxed to 
??????? (801) 584-7076 to Candace Karpakis or Patrick Aman.? If a tie still 
exists, such capacity 
??????? shall be awarded on a prorata basis. 

3. Northwest will not accept bids with a primary contract term (Term) longer 
than indicated 
??????? for the capacity unless maximum rate is bid.

Frank - I'm forwarding the email I received from Enserco regarding the 
penalty for our failure to take the full volume on days 1 and 18 on deal 
#423705.  As I explained to Suzanne, I would not have paid this had they 
invoiced me for it but Enserco is a Netout customer and we were in a net 
receivable position this month so they deducted this amount out of what they 
paid me.  As the penalty seems to be legitimate, can I get you to set up a 
new deal in Sitara to offset the receivable?  If you agree with their 
calculations, can you set up a positive Demand charge of $2,405.03 with Enron 
as the Purchaser and Enserco as the Seller?

Please reply to this email with your approval (or disapproval) of their 
calculation and let me know when you have the demand charge set up (or not).

Call me if you have any questions.

electricity demand. The plan, pending regulatory approval, aims to  build at 
least one 500 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired unit and  at least two 600 
MW coal-fired units over the next decade, for a  total of 1,700 MW. More 
units may be built after 2010, eventually  raising new generation capacity in 
the state to around 3,000 MW.  Wisconsin Public Service also hopes to add to 
the state's power grid  by building the Arrowhead-Weston line, a 250-mile 345 
kilovolt  transmission line from Minnesota to central Wisconsin. The line  
would directly link Wisconsin to power supplies in Canada and North  Dakota, 
easing transmission bottlenecks to the west and south.  Wisconsin imports up 
to 20% of its power.

																														? ? Customer demand under new 10-year wholesale  power contracts with the BPA 
is so strong that the agency must  purchase power on the open market to 
augment its supply. To recover  the cost of these purchases, it proposes to 
tack a 15% charge onto  wholesale rates effective next October. Even with an 
additional  charge, BPA's wholesale rates are still well below wholesale 
market  prices currently forecast for the next five years on the West Coast.  
BPA signed new wholesale contracts last week with more than 130  Northwest 
utilities and industries for 10-years. Those agreements  pushed its total 
firm energy load? up to 11,000 MW. That is  almost 3000 MW more than the 
federal Columbia River Power System can  generate on a firm basis.

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

																											New  Pipeline Interconnection to Offer Canadian Supply
																											
																											
																											
																											?  ? Empire State Pipeline and the National Fuel Gas have  completed a new 
Canadian pipeline interconnection at Pendleton, NY,  allowing natural gas to 
flow to the US from Canada. The volumes from  Canada could flow to the 
Buffalo area market as well as to NFG's  interconnects with Tennessee Gas 
Pipeline in East Aurora, NY and  Ellisburg, PA; Dominion Transmission in 
Ellisburg; and  Transcontinental Pipeline and TETCO at Leidy. Empire Pipeline 
is  owned by ANR and Westcoast Energy's St. Clair Pipelines. ANR  Pipeline 
serves as the physical operator for Empire Pipeline, which  extends for about 
156 miles from Buffalo to Syracuse. Most of the  natural gas will come from 
Western Canada, and the new pipeline will  give more flexibility and supply 
options for Empire's shippers.

																										Rotary Rig Counts Down 
																										
																										
																										
																										?  ? The number of rigs exploring for oil and natural gas in North  America 
fell by 8 for the week ending November 3rd, according to  Baker Hughes. The 
number of rigs operating in the US fell by 6 to  763 to 1,078 compared to 763 
a year ago. The number of rigs in  Canada fell by 2 to 362, compared with 
last year's 336. In the Gulf  of Mexico, the number of rigs searching for oil 
and natural gas fell  by 3 to 148 compared to 113 last year. The number of US 
rigs  searching for oil rose by 4 to 232, while the number searching for  
natural gas fell by 10 to 845. The number of US rigs exploring on  land fell 
5 to 906, while the number operating offshore fell by 3 to  152. The number 
in inland waters rose by 2 to 20.? There were  250 US rigs exploring 
directionally, 68 exploring horizontally, and  760 exploring vertically. The 
weekly rig count reflects the number  of rigs exploring for oil and natural 
gas, not those producing.

																									Governments Negotiate Differences in The  Hague
																									
																									? ? 
																									After a week  of preliminary talks that failed to resolve differences over 
how  best to protect the planet, government leaders have arrived to  bargain 
over the toughest aspects of curbing emissions. About 2,000  lower level 
officials did what they could to prepare for the final  week of negotiations 
among environment ministers or cabinet-rank  officers from at least 150 
countries. The US feels its effort to  find common ground and be flexible has 
not been returned by?  European counterparts. The US has been singled out for 
criticism for  its effort to reduce its commitments. The government 
essentially  agreed to Kyoto because they agreed to the flexibility 
mechanisms  such as emissions trading, now the US is running into trouble 
with  that. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a  new 
global code of behavior on emissions will require ratification  by most of 
the industrial countries. Without a US endorsement, it  would be difficult 
for such a treaty to come into force. The US  Senate already has passed a 
resolution making its ratification  conditional on assurances that the 
nation's competitiveness on world  markets will not be harmed. A select group 
of leading policy makers  held informal closed-door talks in The Hague ahead 
of a ceremony  Monday marking the start of the critical second phase of the  
conference. The politicians are working toward a comprehensive plan  to 
reduce the Earth's output of heat-trapping gasses from  businesses, farms and 
automobiles, without bloating national budgets  or hampering the global 
economy. A board of 2,000 leading  scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, projects  that in the coming 100 years there will be more 
rainfall, a  temperature increase of up to 11 degrees Fahrenheit and a 
sea-level  rise of up to 30 inches. An agreement reached in 1997 in Kyoto,  
Japan, called for a worldwide reduction of carbon-based gas  emissions by an 
average 5.2% below 1990 levels. The target date for  the reductions was 2012. 
Europe is committed to cutting emissions  8%, Japan 6% and the US 7%.

																										and could put  the future of the Midwest ISO in peril. However, FERC has 
never  articulated clearly a requirement that a party exercising a  
contractual termination right must demonstrate that termination is  
consistent with the public interest, according to Dynegy. It also  argued 
that it has not refused to participate in an RTO; it merely  seeks to join 
one that adequately protects its legitimate financial  interests and also 
represents a significant improvement to the  status quo for other market 
participants. Dynegy urged FERC to limit  its decision on whether or not the 
company can leave the ISO to the  facts, not on the uproar Dynegy's actions 
have caused in the  Midwest. Regulators in Illinois and Michigan have 
protested Illinois  Power's

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

																									CFTC  Report Shows Speculators Neutral on Energy Futures 
																									
																									
																									
																									?  ? ?Speculators maintained a neutral position on crude and  heating oil 
futures for the week ending last Tuesday, having cut  bets on rising prices 
they made a few weeks ago, according to the  CFTC report. The neutral posture 
helps to explain why the market has  had trouble getting out of the recent 
price range. As a group, the  hedge funds are not looking for a rally or a 
big decline, they're  just watching for fresh indicators. Crude oil prices 
have been  between about $32 and $34 per barrel on the NYMEX since 
mid-October,  after a brief rally to $37. Prices closed Friday at $32.71 per  
barrel. Speculators had bought 39,480 crude oil contracts and sold  40,373 
contracts, giving them a net short position of 893 contracts.  The funds held 
net-long positions for most of the year, with a peak  of 47,171 lots in 
February. Similarly, speculators' heating oil bets  were almost neutral. Net 
long positions were 1,436 lots after  declining every week from a high for 
the year of 25,780 lots on  September 12th. The following table shows the 
changes.

1. Shipper must submit a separate electronic bid for each package of 
available

multiple 
rates can be submitted each for a partial amount of available transportation

the highest present value for such package of available transportation 
capacity 
shall be considered the valid bid. All other bids from the same Shipper for 
the 
same package of transportation capacity will be discarded. 

2. Northwest awards bids based on a net present value calculation.? If bid 
rate is 
less than minimum tariff rate, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x 
FERC Interest Rate x The Maximum Bid Quantity x 365 days/100/12; or if the 
maximum rate is bid, the following formula is utilized:? Bid Rate x FERC 
Interest 
Rate x Maximum Bid Quantity x days bid/100. In case of a tie, each tied 
shipper 
will have the right to improve its bid by submitting an improved bid within 
24

Thursday, November 2 is our next, less than quarterly, meeting to up date you 
on events that willl affect your business in the Western U.S.

The meeting is at the Hyatt downtown, 1200 Louisiana, starting at 11:30AM.? A 
casual lunch will be served.? The meeting will start at 12:30PM.? If we can 
make it last with lots of good questions and a healthy exchange of views, 
cocktails will be on me in the lobby bar after the meeting--meeting 
attendance is manditory.? The agenda looks like this:

The ever popular Parking Service--An overview with discussion of Pipeline 
Inventory issues and the go forward plan to help fix the problem.

A rundown on the elimination of the IT Queue and our filing for re-hearing 

An overview of West Region demand and expansion plans--everyone will want to 
sign up for this 

Implementation of IT blanket based discounting--maybe, only if you're good 

Nomination dynamics and pro rata ranking plan implementation 

E-Trans implementation 

AND FINALLY--TCPL will present their gas supply views for the Alberta 
systems--an added bonus! 

This is also an opportunity for you to share changes in your organizations 
that others would apppreciate knowing about--name changes, mergers, spin 
offs, divestitures, etc.

Feel free to nominate others in your organization that would benefit. 
?

The proxy price will be Gas Daily and Cantor Fitzgerald for Ca deliveries.  
How do we submit prices to Cantor Fitzgerald?  Anne, we will need to come up 
with  a cash report, much like our monthly index report for the 
publications.  Our data submitted will be under scrutiny at some point in the 
future.  It is important that all of our cash (one day) deals are reported 
accurately each day.

Thanks,
Mike

Subject: Erroneous Messages sent by Andrew Wu/HOU/EES on Wednesday, October 
25th

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,
Enron Global Messaging Team

The following updates have been made to the EnronOnline Website and should be 
available to all customers on their login today:

- Ability to type in volumes in the Submission Box (rather than just using 
the arrows)
- Removal of the "Hour Glassing" effect (in which the browser acted like the 
site was still loading when it was in fact finished)
- New code to fix the caching server issues which prevented some customers 
from successfully upgrading
- Addition of Dow Jones News Feeds (automatic for appropriate categories)

If you have any questions on the above, please contact the EnronOnline Help
