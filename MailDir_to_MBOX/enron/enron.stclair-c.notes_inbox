Jack:
Jim Crump met with Mike Sullivan and Julie Beck yesterday and it appears as
if based on the e-mails that we have exchanged that the next step is to
have a conference call to finalize the ISDA and the remaining open issues.
What I plan to do by tomorrow is circulate a redraft of the Schedules.
Julie and Mike agreed that David Turpin should partic ipate in the call so
that all open issues can be resolved.  Could you please contact my
assistant, Suzanne Adams, at 713-853-7340 and give her some days and times
next week that you and David are available.  I would think that we would
only need an hour.  I plan to have Ken Curry, my credit person, with me for
the call.  Thanks.

Our department will be migrated to Outlook in two groups.  The first group 
will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated 
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook 
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four 
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and 
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training 
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension 
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of 
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists 
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration 
team.  

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the 
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they 
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size 
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, 
etc. before they can send e-mail again.   

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will 
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from 
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages, 
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and 
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000. 

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are 
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE 
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will 
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of 
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your 
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of 
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

I was cleaning out my e-mails.  I don't know if you have found a nanny yet
or if Sarah's fill-in nanny is still available but I thought I would pass
this on just in case.  Hope all is well.

Carol,

For your review, I've attached the adjustments our legal department is
proposing to the Consent to Assignment since receiving your red-lined
version from Rhonda Denton.  As to the transfer effective date, since we are
now into June, we would expect the transfer date to be as of July 1st.
Please let me know as soon as possible your comments on MEGA's most recent
proposed Consent to Assignment (attached below).

 <<MEGA  Assignment Consent Agreement  Version 2 RED_.doc>>

Thanks,

Kristina M. Drew

Hi Carol,

I saw that you posted about getting a nanny.  I've used two services, but 
only one that I can suggest.  For my last nanny, I used Morningside Nanny 
Service, or something close to that. They seemed thorough, and found us a 
wonderful person.  I've also used River Oaks Nanny, but they sent me a nut 
case.

Good luck,

Kay

Jeff Hodge will be out of the office beginning at noon tomorrow through next 
week.  If you have any issues that need to be discussed with him this week, 
please let me know, and I will coordinate an EES/EWS meeting with Jeff 
tomorrow morning.  While Jeff is out of town, he asks that we continue to 
copy him, but all question/issues should be directed to Carol St. Clair.  Jim 
Keller will be back next week and will be setting up meeting times with Carol 
as we have with Jeff.

		Not commonly exported to the US, Boerenkaas is a farmhouse, unpasteurized 
cow?s milk cheese that has been aged for over 18 months.  A special variant 
of traditional Gouda, its characteristics are similar to our ever-popular 
Extra Aged Gouda.  Aged Boerenkaas? interior is firm and has a sharp, tangy 
flavor that is anything but mild.  Hints of Swiss and Cheddar can be detected 
beneath its salty fruitiness.  With its rich, robust flavor, Aged Boerenkaas 
is suitable as either a table cheese or a dessert cheese, and is excellent 
with your choice of fruit and a bold red wine. LIMITED QUANTITY: AVAILABLE 
ONLY TO CHEESE OF THE MONTH SUBSCRIBERS.

		Super Special!
		SuperSpecial - Oud Brugge 
		Dad likes a sale too, right?  For the month of June, we are featuring Oud 
Brugge at a SuperSpecial price of $4.99 per pound.  You?ll never find a 
wonderful cheese like Oud Brugge for such a low price anywhere but at 
iGourmet.com!  Tradition and nostalgia were the driving factors behind the 
creation of Oud Brugge, meaning ?Old Bruges?, which is named after the 
charming Belgian town. This special cheese is ripened for twelve months, over 
which time it develops its delicious taste and even texture. Very little salt 
is used in the creation of this product, which allows it to maintain a mild 
but complex flavor, in spite of its long ripening time. Similar to Old 
Amsterdam and Extra Aged Gouda, it is sure to become a new favorite.  Oud 
Brugge is perfect with a glass of fine wine or port!

Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to 
provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral 
arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market. In that 
regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting 
different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury 
Notes and Treasury Bonds.  Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have 
the "choice" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations 
such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this 
option.  

LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit 
requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of 
Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13. 

CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting 
types of Eligible Collateral other than cash.

We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of 
Eligible Collateral to Library Doc.

		Coombe Farm Cheddar
		SuperSpecial - Coombe Farm English Cheddar $3.99/lb!
		 Cheddar cheese has been produced on farms in the county of Somerset in 
Southwestern England for hundreds of years. Cheeses called "Cheddar" that 
come from anywhere other than Somerset and its neighboring counties are 
merely imposters. The authentic English Cheddar we are featuring here is made 
in Somerset from rich, local milk and aged for over 12 months in temperature 
controlled storage units. We found it to be of excellent quality, possessing 
all the great traits we've come to expect in a good cheddar - sharp, nutty 
and not overly dry.

Michele:

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I 
believe an additional 10-12 days).

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence 
until December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if there is anything else you need.

Mark

Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Mary

I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you 
may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please 
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila  
contributing.  Are you interested?

Hi,

The sick leave policy is 4 weeks at 100% and 22 weeks at 90%.  So some of 
that time will fall into the 90% pay.

Take care!

Hi Mark,

Please forward this information to the time-keeper in order that her time off 
will be coded  correctly. An alternative would be for Carol to complete her 
timesheets before she leaves.  With SAP this can be done in advance.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi again:

Fast response, I know.  I was sending a message to Travis when yours came in, 
so I'll reply right away.  I would like to put in $35 if that is okay with 
you - I'm not sure what the grand total would be.  Good luck again with nanny 
search.  Glad to hear that everyone is well.  Hard to believe, but Britta, my 
oldest, just had her 14th birthday last week!!  They grow so quickly and are 
so precious.  Take care,

Mary

Thanks for the info and I will check with Stacy.  I am planning to return 
sometime around January 8th assuming I can find someone.  I have thoroughly 
enjoyed my time at home and hope that the transition back to work goes 
smoothily.  I'm sure it will take me a few weeks to get back into it after 
being away from it for 6 months.  Charles is doing great as is Arthur.  Look 
forward to seeing you soon.  Would $25 be okay with you for Suzanne's gift?

Hi Carol:

Good to hear from you again.  It is 4th quarter-as-usual around here.  Sorry 
I didn't get back to you earlier about Suzanne, but yes, I am interested in 
chipping in on that.  It's a great idea, and Suzanne should love it!  Let me 
know how much I should contribute.  As for your nanny question, I can't help 
you there.   Have you asked Stacy Dickson if she is using an agency, or 
whether her sister used an agency?  They are much more recently in the market 
for this.  Hope they can help you out - good luck!  I am sure it is not going 
to be easy to come back.  Have you set a date for your return yet?

Mary

I am beginning the process of looking for a nanny and was wondering if you 
may know of someone or know of an agency that you trust.  We are looking for 
someone to commute to our house each day.  If you do know of someone, please 
let me know.  Also,  on Suzanne's gift, looks like so far it's me and Sheila  
contributing.  Are you interested?

Janette,

Yes, Mark is available.  

Just a suggestion--I have found it very helpful to have "read" access of 
Calendars for all of Mark's direct reports-for availibility purposes.  Let me 
know if you want me to have METaylor to edit his Calendar Profile.

I need to meet with both Marks to finalize the details on my return to work. 
I'm happy to come to the office to meet with them.  Next week, the only day 
that is not good is next Tuesday.  I think that we need about 1 hour.  Could 
you please check with Mark Taylor's secretary and then let me know what works 
best for Mark H. and Mark T.? Thanks.

I am sure Irma has come up with a position by now, but I will give you her
name and number just in case.  It is Irma Navas, 713/838-7360.  She speaks
very limited english, so if you don't speak any Spanish that could be a bit
of a problem, although her daughter *(age 18) is bi-lingual.

If I hear of anyone else I will keep your name around.  I got my nanny thru
word of mouth -- seems like the a common way!

I am a friend of Trina Chandler's and am currently looking for a full time
nanny to take care of my 4 month old.  Trina mentioned to me that you had a
temp a few months ago that was looking for a full time position.  Do you
know if she is still available?  If so, please call me at home at
281-890-7122 or e-mail me.  If you know of anyone else that may be looking
for a job, please keep me in mind.  How did you find your nanny?

Carol,

I am about to be on nanny #9 since July, 1999 - I haven't had great luck and 
always have a live-in.  I am presently going through Au Pair in America and I 
would be happy to have them send you info - but they do live in and there is 
a pretty substantial agency fee.  My assistant, Erica Braden, also found an 
interesting website www.nanniesplus.com which seems to have a whole range of 
different types of nannies who work in different circumstances (i.e. live-in, 
live-out, housework, no housework, etc.) - this also involves an agency and a 
smaller (but not insignificant) fee than au pair in America.  From time to 
time Ali's school will have a posting for a nanny - I'll forward it to you if 
I see such a listing.  Good luck - may you fare better than I have!

Cynthia

I need to start thinking about hiring a nanny to take care of Charles, our 4 
month old and Arthur, our 9 year old.  We are looking for someone that can 
come to our house during the week as we do not have room for a live-in.  We 
live off of 290 West, about 25 miles from downtown.  We would prefer someone 
that is legal and speaks English, but won't rule out anyone else.  If you 
know of someone that might be interested, please call or e-mail me.  While I 
would prefer not to use an agency, if you know of a good one, please let me 
know. Please pass this message on to anyone else at Enron that you think 
might be able to help.  Thanks.

Hi Carol

I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.  I used a 
service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of 
candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).

Good luck on your search.

ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after 
Thanksgiving.

I wish I knew of someone for you -- I'll keep my ears open.  How are you 
doing?  Our baby is due 1/16 -- we are all very excited although it will be 
interesting to see how 31-month old Emma reacts!  Looks like we might be 
ships passing in the night with my leaving and your returning, but I hope to 
see you soon.

Debra:

As Debra and I discussed, we are  currently preparing a GISB contract for GPU 
Services Company, as agent for ______.  I mentioned to Debra that when we 
have a counterparty who is represented in transactions by an agent, we  work 
to include the attached agency riders in the master agreement.  These riders 
include reps and warranties relating to the agent's authority as well as an 
acknowledgment by the principal relating to same.  I propose that you all 
consider the attached riders when preparing master agreements in an agency 
context.  

To the extent that the counterparty is amenable, I strongly urge you to 
propose that the principal enter into the contract on its own behalf and that 
the contract merely recite that the agent is authorized to enter into 
transactions pursuant to the agreement for and on behalf of the principal.  
This is the approach I am going to try with GPU.  If an agent represents 
multiple principals, try to enter into a separate master with each principal. 

However, to the extent the counterparty absolutely refuses this approach, at 
the very least I would include the riders and get acknowledgments from the 
principal(s).  If there are multiple principals, try to get a separate 
agreement with the agent for each principal (as opposed to one master with an 
agent on behalf of numerous principals) to avoid questions about allocation 
of transactions and credit exposures.

Please feel free to follow up with any questions or comments.

I have also attached for your reference a memorandum I prepared some time ago 
regarding various issues to consider when dealing with an agency relationship.

Leslie

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

 Carol -- I came across this message from Sarah Duckers last night as
I was cleaning out my e-mails.  I don't know if you have found a nanny yet
or if Sarah's fill-in nanny is still available but I thought I would pass
this on just in case.  Hope all is well.

Hi Carol--I bet your ears have been burning for a couple of days!  This is 
the part of tennis that I really don't like.  I've had numerous email 
conversations with the person who originated the email to Cheryl Hultquist.  
Her original email to Cheryl was meant to be an inquiry, not a protest.  One 
of her concerns was that, if our team did make it to a play-off situation, 
and it was determined at that time that you should be a 4.5, then we would 
have to forfeit all games that you played in for the entire season.  This 
evidently happened to her team two years ago.  (I think she's rationalizing 
after-the-fact.)

You probably know that this person--that lodged the "protest"--is Betsie 
Hollis.  She's my women's team captain.  I've called her on the carpet about 
this...and let her know that by trying to hurt Bill Hunt's team, she is 
hurting me, too.  She did try to withdraw her "protest," but Cheryl had 
evidently already taken action.  There are so many people out there that are 
mis-ranked.  The fellow playing with Kelly last Sunday should not be a 
3.5...the woman we played against should not be a 3.5...Elise Shepherd should 
not be a 4.5...and on and on.  I have heard through Roger White--Rice U's 
womens coach and a USTA verifier--that they are slowly trying to rectify 
mis-rankings by looking more closely at league and tournament results.  I 
think you may be the first casualty of this endeavor.

Bill Hunt has all sorts of counter-arguments.  He had Cheryl's approval to 
play you in mixed at 4.0.  Maybe if we promise to play you with our weaker 
4.0 men--who are borderline 3.5 material--they'd let it pass.  Who knows.  If 
we are going to lose you--and Chris after this week--we're going to be pretty 
weak, not to mention demoralized.

After all, we're all just trying to have some fun on the tennis court.  
Speaking of which, this Sunday is Chris' last match before his big move to 
North Carolina.  We're out at Lee LeClear.  I don't remember if you or Bill 
are scheduled to play, but please join us for a little send-off celebration 
after the match if you can.
