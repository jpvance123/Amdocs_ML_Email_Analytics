Steve,

I have a book edited by Helyette regarding insurance derivatives.
I shall make a few copies of the most important articles
for you.

Vince, Vasant

I've just been speaking to Gillian Lockwood from our Tax group, who is 
interested in your work on ins. derivs.  Have you any general articles on the 
principles of pricing these instruments?

Many thanks,
Steve

Nick:

We are unable to get a VC location for 10:30 AM, however, we can have one 
at  11:00 AM. Houston time.  Is there anyway that we could push the interview 
to 11:00 AM?  I know you have to make reservations for your conference room
also.  If not, we will have to do a phone interview.

Please let me know.

Thanks!

Nick,

We may have problems getting the VC location in Houston on  short notice.
We are currently on stand-by. We shall default, if we have no other choice,
to a phone interview.

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

Dear Dale, Stinson & Vince,

I would like to take this opportunity to communicate some information to 
summarise the projects of the past six months.  Firstly, by all accounts it 
has been an amazing few months for me - I believe that I have kept a large 
number of commercial group heads very happy.  However, not all are aware of 
my activities, so, many people (e.g. John Sherriff, Richard Lewis, Steve 
Young etc.) will not know of everything I have done.  For example the amount 
of work that I put into the inflation models and the extent to which I was 
critical for the successful building of those curves and the consequent 
impact (o7+ million for Q1) and similar large P&L swings for Eastern contract 
optionality (short virtual power station) based upon my UK Power Vol Curve 
Generator.

For your benefit, I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on 
over the past five/six months:

1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March + April internal audit + 
June external audit)
2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator & ideas for half-hourly vol curve
3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
4) Energydesk.com models & support
5) Real Options: options to build/extend power stations (e.g. Wessex deal, 
Anti-Freeze project)
6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified 
distributions)
7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward 
curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha)
8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old 
Asian models)
9) Continental gas volatility curve construction
10) Communication objective I: two presentations to Enron Europe staff, one 
to Oslo office
11) Communication objective II: meetings to gather information and present 
results
12) FAS 133: working with internal and external auditors on matching 
financial and physical (accrual) hedges - hedge effectiveness
13) Oslo trip: bringing Oslo up to speed on EXOTICA and option valuation
14) Houston Research staff: co-ordinating communication/meetings to maximise 
productivity
15) Valuation/Marketing of Power put options for banks that hold senior and 
sub debt in merchant power plant

Meeting breakdown:
 
 Initiated by me & booked into meeting rooms  Attended (initiated by others) 
Jan  4       5
Feb  6       5
Mar  23       8
Apr  25       4
May  34       5
Jun  12 (so far)       3

I believe I have kept as many commercial groups happy as is possible; it is 
clear that I have been critical to large P&L sensitive projects and hope that 
I can continue to help enhance earnings going forward.

Regards,

Anjam

How many days are you coming over for?  In addition to the couple of days 
you'll be spending at Brook Hunt, I can see one further day with our metals

Hi Dale,

I just talked to the Actuarial Education Company and found that the combined 
material packs (CMPs) are priced per course as follows:-

101 Statistical Modelling:
102 Financial Mathematics
103 Stochastic Modelling
104 Survival Models
105 Actuarial Mathematics
106 Actuarial Mathematics II
107 Economics
108 Finance and Financial Reporting
109 Financial Economics

302 Life insurance
303 General Insurance

Having reviewed, I think the most suitable ones to order are suggested in 
blue.  This adds up to o525 for the sub-set in blue; alternatively we can 
stick to 103 through 106 for o356 -> I suggest we go for the smaller sub-set 
to start off with.

Regards,

Anjam

I will sit Anjam down before he leaves and explain the confidentiality 
provisions in his contract and that we will pursue them vigorously.  Melanie 
- can you give me a copy, Steve, let me know when he is leaving - I'll do it 
closer to the time.

Subject: Actions on Anjam's resignation

All

My preferred approach to dealing with Anjam's departure is given below.  
These recommendations are informed by the fact that I don't feel Anjam has 
much to offer his next employer, except what code and data he can remove from 
Enron:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know 
our positions and curves next.

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from 
Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.

Steve

Dale,

To follow up on my earlier message. Anjam expressed his concern
that Sharad is holding off on our offer. I would consider bumping it up to 
55,000
with a sign-on bonus. We badly need fresh talent.

 I shall be in Australia next week. If you need
any additional intervention from us, please, call Stinson.

Vince

Dale,

I was very impressed with Sharad and I think that we should consider paying 
offering him
 o50,000. I am not sure about guaranteed bonus. What do you think?

Hi Dale (& Vince),

I have now gathered everyone's views and the consensus is that we should hire 
Sharad to work with me on front-office pricing and so we should proceed to 
the offer stage.  As you can see his salary is o43,500 currently and he 
appears to have a guaranteed bonus of o25,000 for next year.  He would join 
for >o50,000 from my discussions with Alex Blair, the consultant.  He is very 
interested in Enron, but is also talking to Morgan Stanley.  I discussed with 
Vince, who recommended that Sharad should come in at the same level (rank) as 
Kirstee Hewitt; I would also like to arrange for a direct reporting line to 
me for Sharad.

Regards,

Anjam

P.S. Kate:  I have attached the agencies terms and conditions below:

Hi Karin,

I just wanted to check the status of our change in equipment for start of 
business Monday.  I've been told that Tony and I will be using loaner PC's.  
The folks in IT are asking me where that loaner PC is so they can install all 
of the software that I need.  Slava has told me that you are the point of 
contact.  I just wanted to check with you to see if you need any additional 
information from me - or if I can be of help in any way.  Thanks!!

Steve,

I shall E-mail you my standard real option spin presentation + plus a 
presentation on Enron
(for analysts). You can use a few slides to  introduce the company.

I would prefer not to disseminate the information about the  use of AMC. The 
industry
does not know about it yet and I consider it a very  powerful tool (given its
flexibility).

I have the files on my laptop. I shall bring it to work to morrow
and send it to you.

Please, remind me about it on Thursday (old age and the hectic pace here start
showing up).

Vince

Subject: Response from Lenos

Vince

Lenos got back to me, and said he'd prefer a high-level overview of real 
options in Enron, perhaps using my notation to express the ideas.  He wants 
me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.

Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and 
I'll look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.  My own efforts to date 
have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I 
obviously don't have the high-level view you have.  This will ensure I get 
the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.

If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely:
1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation;
2. Gas storage;
3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.

I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we 
prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.  I haven't used AMC myself up 
till now, I've been carrying out static optimizations, with different price 
curve scenarios being run through.

I'm still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach 
- people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and 
they're still being supplied with useful products, as per my "Real Options 
Strategy" document.

Cheers,
Steve

Subject: Re: London Status Report - Research Weather

Hi Mike,

Please find a list of our current daily products and services, together with 
identified research projects (to-date) for European Weather research - this 
has been forwarded to Tani Nath to aid her recommendations for a 2nd Met. for 
London.

1) This week:

* A meeting with James Willis (Agriculture) has been arranged for Monday 
afternoon to discuss weather input for Softs. 
* Following suggestion from Tani, meeting has been pencilled in with Pierre 
Aury (Coal Trading) to discuss  weather input.
* At present we are providing Kristian Lande (Continental Power) with daily 
precipitation outlook for Spain - he is working towards getting a daily 
weather breifing for Power set up.
* A meeting with Alex McLeish (Global Products) has been pencilled in 
following his return from Houston to discuss the way forward in building a 
forecast model for Crude API based on HDDs on either side of the Atlantic.
* We have made progress in getting additional information on European Ports 
following meeting with Scott Moncrieff and Sylvie Mostura (Shipping and 
Transportation) - we now get forwarded daily reports for some Baltic, Black 
Sea, Scandanavian, Italian and Indian ports, which include various degrees of 
weather information.
* We now supply North Sea conditions and forecasts as a part of the 8am UK 
Gas Briefing.
* We've added a midday "update" for UK Gas traders if/when MRF ensembles 
warrent changes or clarification.
*Following extremely useful meeting with Tani Nath, it is now clear that need 
for 2nd Meteorologist will have to be cleared with her superiors here in 
London before moving forward. 

2) Still to follow up
* Get meeting with Chris Mahoney to determine if we can provide any 
additional support (e.g. daily briefing) for Crude and Products.
* Follow up on a potential morning briefing for Continental Power.
*Get meeting arranged with David Anderson at ECMWF to discuss data products 
and services they provide.
*Continue to investigate Model GRIB data to produce a "confidence interval" 
for model output.
*Meet with Ross Mcyntire to determine needs from weather drivatives
*Develop a standard hydro product (daily updates) for Continental Power 
(Spain specifically)
*Develop Forecast Verification scheme and internal forecasting tools
*Avistar recorded Europe briefings

3) Challenges:

* Still appears to be some confusion over whether we are moving desks this 
afternoon or not! 
*Karin Ahamer (the team assistant here) is going to verify later exactly 
which PCs we will be using from Monday next week (some of the loaner PCs we 
are currently using contain important software left over from their previous 
users).
* Our time in assembling reports is becoming more efficient on a daily 
basis.  However as our product load increases this may become a factor over 
next few weeks.

______________

Mike,
 
We look forward to talking with you and Vince later today!

See you later,

Tony

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

Steve,

RAC will be a bit unhappy about it. I think that Bjorn will object to it.
Let me talk to you tomorrow over the phone and discuss it.
The question is how to present it to RAC in a such a way that
Rodrigo will not be put in a bad light.

Hi Vince

I've had a chat with Rodrigo Lamas, who is a bit unhappy in his current role 
in RAC (he wants to be a bit more proactive, and finds the inertia 
frustrating).  I would be very interested in bringing him into Research with 
responsibility for VaR/risk mgt, which is where his professional experience 
lies.  He also has a PhD in optimization from Imperial College London which 
I'm sure we can make use of.

There will obviously be some political issues involving such a move only 4 
months into his career at Enron, and if you're able then I'm sure he'd 
appreciate a chat with you.

We're awaiting your response before Rodrigo mentions this to anyone else.

Steve

Subject:	Softs (Ag) Support

Hi Guys,

I thought I would quickly update you on a few meetings we've had with the ag folks here over the past 2 days.  They are extremely interested in weather support and appear to be our most enthusiastic customer group to date.  A summary:

1) They are interested in Cocoa, Coffee and Sugar.  Specifically:
	Brazil:  Londrina, Bauru, Lavras   (All WMOs available in Accuweather)
	Vietnam:  Kentum, Dalat (No data immediately evident)
	Ivory Coast:  Man, Gagnoa (WMOs in Accuwx)
	Indonesia:  Sumatra-Kotubumi, Sulawesi-Dolo (No data immediately evident)

2) They are specifically interested in event spikes - extreme temperature, precipitation or wind.  They are also interested in any trend information we can devise.  Links between ENSO or other large scale oscillations that could have long range effects.  Tony has already given their group a 101 course on ENSO and its impacts on these areas.

3) They would eventually like daily AM briefings - along with a daily product related to their market (ie precip/temp graphs etc)

4) They do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best.

Tony and I agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible.  We should be able to add any lat/long points we want to the list of international cities streaming through from the MRF/AVN/ECMWF from EarthSat.  The problems here would be the models' problems handling tropical weather along with specific local effects - especially in Indonesia.

Let's talk about this at some point and get our thoughts together.

Steve

Anjam, thanks for organising this - and Vince thanks for making yourself 
available for the discussion.

I am working for Joe Gold and my group is concerned with adding the web as an 
additional sales and communication channel for our European business units. 
Through the web we are also able to convey a more local image, rather than 
presenting ourselves as a Texan company through Enron.com.
To set you into perspective about what we have in mind I have attached a 
brief presentation which has been the basis for the sign off of the project.



We intend to display a wide training section for the following reasons:
document our know-how base
educate the market participants
generate great stickiness (participants should know that if they need to know 
s.th. on energy risk mgt. they should go to Enron)
later on: have the option to commercialise this area.

I look forward to our discussion.

Kind regards
Sven Becker

Hi guys

A number of us interviewed a guy named Matthew Williams last week for an 
Analyst position.  He has a PhD in particle physics and experience with monte 
carlo simulation (albeit in FORTRAN77) from his academic work.  He's also a 
good communicator, having completed a postgrad course in acting, and has been 
active in the theatre as performer and director.

If he accepts our job offer then (after discussion with Dale and Bryan) we've 
decided to give him his first rotation in Research here in London.  I hope he 
accepts.

I'll keep you posted.

Subject: Amitava's visit

Really appreciate your freeing amitava up to provide critical input into the 
quantitative work we have undertaken.  As you are aware much of the work 
requires exploring uncharted territory and the team has confirmed the 
significant contribution that Amitava's experience and expertise has provided 
in a very short timeframe.

As you might expect, this quickly confirms that we really need more dedicated 
support from someone with Amitava's background.  It is imperative that we 
leverage his experience to speed up the process and apply critical insights 
into our project.  This will not only speed up the work considerably but also 
ensure that we have put our best team on the difficult issues in front of us.

I would like to discuss an arrangement where we can ensure Amitava is more 
integrated into our efforts.  I realize it will be difficult to free him up 
but maybe we can put something together which works for everybody.

some early ideas:  

have amitava and family come over for 6 weeks of dedicated support.  this 
should allow us to develop the communication processes to run a global quant 
effort for the project and then continue with Amitava a full time EC.com 
resource working from Houston.  This is likely my preference.

or

agree a schedule of regular trips which allows Amitava to provide critical 
insights and oversight of the project and give our team a resource to extract 
his experience on an ongoing basis.

Let's discuss before I talk to john about the practicalities

Thanks for your assistance.

Dear All,

I would like to make myself available for some meetings at the Oslo office 
during my visit on Friday pm, Monday and Tuesday.  I believe Bjarne will be 
available on Tuesday, if not Monday, and so would like to arrange the Trading 
and Origination meetings for Tuesday (so that he can attend) and maybe go 
through the EnergyDesk issues on Monday.  I will also give a presentation, 
probably on Monday.

TRADING: OPTIONS & VOLATILITY CURVES
It would be useful to meet with the traders along with Bjarne's team to help 
us improve our understanding of the valuation/hedging issues encountered in 
trading options (both European and Asian).  I hope to discuss the vol curves 
and will bring the example of the recent work done for the UK electricity 
desk where a monthly volatility curve generator and initial half-hourly 
forward volatility curve have been developed.

ORIGINATION:
Any issues arising in complex deals (e.g. dry reservoir, user-time contracts) 
etc. perhaps with Didrik.

ENERGYDESK.COM
To support the on-going effort to ensure the accuracy of the EnergyDesk.com 
systems, I hope to help James Stephen nail-down the reasons for some of the 
discrepancies between the EnergyDesk.com valuation and the Oslo book (for 
this I hope to meet with Trond).

EXOTIC OPTIONS:
If everything runs smoothly, I plan to roll-out the new Asian model which 
should also help us in improving our electricity volatility curve.

I will be in the Oslo office from Friday afternoon, and available all day 
Monday and Tuesday.  I will be staying at the Grand Hotel and probably 
contactable on my mobile: 07747 86813.

Look forward to meeting you soon!

Regards,

Anjam

Sharad

As expected we didn't get time to discuss in detail what to do in Houston.  
We have discussed the subject informally, but I'm laying it out here for 
clarity, and for Vince/Stinson's information.  Here are my thoughts:

1. Exotica.  This is the top priority, as you'd rightly identified yourself.
 a. Learn how to build xlls.
 b. Catalogue functions in Houston Exotica not yet available in London.
 c. Catalogue differences between inputs to London and Houston Exotica 
functions.
 d. Produce London xll that allows current function calls to be used where 
possible, and incorporates new functions.
 e. Update documentation as appropriate.
 If you do nothing else in your two weeks, I'll be very happy with this.  
Main contacts are Paulo and Zimin.

2. Understand American Monte Carlo (AMC).  The aim is to get a feel for AMC's 
characteristics.  Before we embark on the use of AMC for real option 
valuation, I'd like to understand how it behaves for financial options.  I 
suggest something like the following:
 a. Produce AMC code for single GBM for American option.  Compare Greeks 
against those from appropriate tree methods.
 b. Two GBM spread option model, to compare against 1-d numerical integration 
method.  Although the "American" bit of AMC isn't going to be used here, it 
will be interesting to think about the bucketing issue in price/payoff space 
and, again, the Greeks.
 c. Some form of mean reverting model, preferably two factor.
 d. HJM for pure financial option valuation.
 If you get somewhere on a-d, and AMC behaves sensibly on pure financial 
models, then I'll be very keen to roll it out for real option valuations.

Vince/Stinson - since I'm expecting the worst from IT i.t.o. email support, 
would you be good enough to print this email out and hand it to Sharad?

Many thanks,
Steve

Hi Lucy/Natalie

Given that Manabu is perceived as the "Specialist" type, and probably 
shouldn't go straight into the gas trading group, this may have implications 
for Research headcount if he's considered a good non-A&A hire.

I'll be spending the next couple of weeks canvassing opinions from various 
VPs and MDs over their preferred size, role and style of Research group for 
Europe.  I think we should delay Manabu's second round interviews for a while.

Cheers,
Steve

Steve,

I am out of the office tomorrow and was just wondering if you'd had a chance 
to think about the interview list for Manabu?

If you get a list together, Natalie will be able start working on it - 
alternatively I will catch up with you on Monday.

Natalie - just so you know Manabu will be coming in for second round but not 
for the A&A programme - probably a Specialist in Steve's group (we'll pass it 
over to commercial support next week)

Vince,

I work for the Market Risk RAC London group. I review the quantitative issues 
arising from Enron Europe models.
I am in this function given my background (PhD from Imperial College-London) 
and also due to my past experience
as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and Louis Dreyfus.

My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern, 
...), as well as the 
review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their 
respective volatility curves.
Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market, 
its respective
price curve and term structure of volatility. 
Bjorn and David suggested it could be very productive if I had the chance to 
meet you and your team
to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools.
 
I will be in Houston from the 10th to 15th September. I wonder if you could 
book some time for me in
your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same.

Thanks,

My wife checked with our bank - it will take up to 10 days for the $2000 
check to clear.

I checked with Enterprise (the car hire people) last night and the total bill 
will be about $1251  - I don't have this much left on my credit card, help!

I am really sorry about the hassle this is causing you, but I need some way 
for Enron to pay directly for the car, that way I won't need the $2000 check.

Many thanks for your help

Vince - thanks for the update.  What I am not sure of is what if any decision 
has to be
made on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals 
have already
been approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or 
two.

Subject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  

John,

This is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.

1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH 
and give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the 
decision
to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island 
project (please, see point 2).

2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest 
(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island 
transaction. The next step
will be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  
in one place and
to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is 
meeting to close a few
remaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.

A few comments on the book design and my view of the project:

a. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island 
facility
by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent
supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term
contracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.

The fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the 
long-term
contract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are 
setting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal 
cargos
but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and 
coordinating
the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,
we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.

b. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension 
option of
5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we
have no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for 
such a long tenor. This is  
essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread 
and
I would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.

One solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the 
first
5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.

c. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions
regarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a 
big prudence reserve
in case we mark it to market.

d. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island 
deal
(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.
Long-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail 
that 
correlates very well with Brent.

I haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  
Anyway with Greg moving to his
new role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the 
Eastern Hemishere plus LNG.

I understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for 
LNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand
that another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far 
away).  Anway I understand this
is a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you 
please let me know where you stand now?

I will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in 
the next couple of days and if you
have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.

Look forward to connecting with you Vince.

John, 

I hope you had a good Easter weekend. I typically take Monday Easter off but  
this year too much was going on. 

Two items I wanted to mention: 

1. Tony Hamilton, weather support 

Tony Hamilton, a meteorologist Ph.D. hired to support Global Markets, spent 
a  
few weeks in Houston, in training with Mike Roberts' team. He went back to  
London 10 days ago and he hit the ground running. He is supporting not only  
crude and weather derivatives, but also gas and power, and is inundated with  
requests for help.  

He is supported by another member of Mike Roberts' team, Steve Bennett, on a  
temporary assignment (10 days planned originally).  

Action recommended.  

a. Extension of Steve Bennett temporary assignment for a few more weeks. I  
have already authorized extension till the 27th. I shall speak more with 
Tani  
on Wednesday about it. ?b. ?Hiring another weather person to work with Tony  
Hamilton, supporting gas and power across continental Europe. 



2. Stinson Gibner 

Slava is currently in Houston, learning more about research group here and  
building a network of relationships. I have a very high opinion of Salvia -  
he is a very bright person, very personable and hard working. I still worry  
about the depth and breadth of his experience, his understanding of the  
totality of Enron business and the relative ?importance of multiple  
activities we have to support. I think it makes sense to have a more  
experienced research person coaching him for 18-24 months. I talked to Bryan  
Seyfried and Ted Murphy and they expressed similar concerns about the depth  
of support they expect. 

Action recommended. 

I still think it makes sense to bring Stinson Gibner to London for an  
extended stay. To manage Slava's expectations, I would call Stinson a Head 
of  
Research for Europe and Asia. His responsibility would also include  
coordination of research and model building for other locations than London  
where I see a lot of activity that goes on without regular audits and ? 
reviews we have in Houston, and over which we have no control (except for  
reacting to requests for assistance). I propose that Stinson come to London  
in the next few days to discuss the potential assignment with you. 


By the way, Greg Whalley agrees with the idea of a senior research person in  
London. He, however, recommended Vasant - stronger work ethics is the main  
consideration.

This is precisely the concern I have for Kirstee.  Steve tells me that she is 
very imaginative and eager to try to add value, but she has no local 
supervisor to help push some of her ideas.  I will give you an update of our 
discussion later and solicit your suggestions.

Subject: Meeting today

Hi Grant - as Anjam has set up a meeting for 9:30 your time how about we try 
and talk afterwards. Originally we said 10:00 your 
time but I guess that the MG meeting will take longer than half an hour. Are 
you free around 10:30  your time ?

I think some of the communication problems I originally had with Anjam have 
been resolved (although it was a difficult situation to interpret) however, I 
would very much like to discuss the situation that I am in concerning my 
immediate management. 
I have felt that over the last month I have been floundering a little and 
have not really been able to turn to anyone in London for direction 
concerning VaR (although as expected Steve has been very helpful to give me 
an idea on how to proceed theoretically). I do have many of my own ideas 
although I think I need to obtain some kind of authority to start any 
substantial work. At the moment I feel like I am doing a lot of small things 
and am worried that at some stage someone is going to ask the question - 
What exactly does she do over there in Research ???

I have talked to Rodrigo  Lamas (RAC model validation new hire) and he has 
helped me to focus on some points I had already made. 
As a quick summary I have drawn up a memo which outlines some of the points I 
think need to be addressed as far as the VaR model is concerned (I could do a 
similar memo for the Credit Reserve model but to start have focused my 
comments on Market Risk).
It is a bit rough and ready (pls excuse any appalling spelling mistakes!) but 
I think it will help you to see what I have been thinking about since I have 
been here.



I do think that the most important issue is that concerning the origin of the 
vol/price curves and how they are constructed. 

Cheers
Kirstee

Good talking with you this morning.  By all means, talk to Grant Masson about
who else is using the Henwood model within Enron.

Attached are the workbooks I mentioned.  The "Details of Jan and July.xls"
workbook contains the resulting listing from the query I gave you yesterday
and you can see how the supply curve was created from that.  The supply curve
becomes nonsense at points for reasons I believe are related to reliability
commitment constrants, instead of pure economic dispatch, and to the aggregate
reporting problem I described in my note yesterday.

The workbook "Supply Curve.xls" has the simplistic, average supply curve I
mentioned, constructed from fuel and VOM costs.  Depending on the question you
are trying to answer, it may be an approach to consider.

The Henwood Contacts I had in mind are:

Tao Guo, PhD, Senior "Algorithmist"  (916-569-0985) * the one I was thinking
of
Wenxiong Huang, PhD Senior Project Consultant (916-569-0985)
Ajit Kulkarni, PhD, Software Product Manager (916-569-0985) * more a trainer,
but sharp
Cosimo Coscia, Senior Consultant (South Australia) 618-8357-1244 * very
resourceful
Wade Schauer, Staff Consultant, (916-569-0985) * best for questions about EMSS
per se

all have emails, of course.  Template:  tguo@hesinet.com

Also, if you can not get satisfaction, contact Eric Toolson, VP
(916-569-0985).  He has a laconic style, but is very focused on customer
satisfaction and retention.  And he has the pull to make things happen.

Regards,
Michael






>>> Karolina Potter/LON/ECT@ENRON 08/24/00 07:08AM >>> 
Michael, 

I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I am
currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppard
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and
consequently the person to contact in case of problems. 

I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provide
the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the
numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack and
system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort each
station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge though,
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea
Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations
according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station
Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows: 

For each hour, for each generating station: 

"marginal cost" [o/MWh] = (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh] -
VOM_cost [o/MWh] 

This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a marginal
station which I get on the stack as a result of the above calculation is not a
station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea Marginal Units query. I
have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and TransArea_Data table but non
of the costs there match my results. 

Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which
outputs I should be using to obtain the right results? 

It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this case
could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much. 

Regards 

Karolina

Hi Dale & Vince,

For your benefit I have compiled a shortlist of the main projects worked on 
over the past five months:

1) Inflation curve modelling (February and March)
2) UK Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
3) Nordic Power Monthly Vol Curve generator
4) Energydesk.com models & support
5) Compound options for UK Power desk (options to build power stations)
6) Continental power non-generic options (using arbitrary trader-specified 
distributions)
7) Global products: non-generic options modelling and new commodity forward 
curve construction (benzene fwd curve from naphtha)
8) Exotic options library upgrade/model test/bug fixes (e.g. testing new/old 
Asian models)
9) Continental gas volatility curve construction

The best summary for this is in the attached presentation that I gave to the 
London and Oslo staff recently.

Regards,

Anjam

Grant,

I agree. We shall give him an offer of a job in Houston (on the terms
we discussed with)  plus an option to stay in
London, if he does not like Houston.  His choice. I think we extended a very 
generous offer to him
and he may have an excessive perception of his contribution to Enron.

Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in our attempt to convince Anjam that he 
should transfer on a local US package. The difficulty is not so much the 
compensation and benefits, it seems more to do with the actual job and 
long-term prospects. He will only, therefore, commit to 12 months and only on 
assignment terms. 

We explained to Anjam the rationales for transferring locally, ie not just 
cost but equitability among his peers. He is convinced that his skills and 
Enron knowledge are valueable enough to warrant an assignment rather than a 
local deal. Also, he was apparently told by Vince that it was impossible for 
you to find a local hire for this role as you were not paying the market 
rate. 

Would you like to move further with this? If so, we can put together costs 
for you for a 12 month assignment and see what you think. I am out tomorrow 
but back in on Friday and could do it for you then.

Let us know!

Subject: Houston Research Opportunity

Dear Vince & Grant,

Thanks very much for the offer to go to Houston as a Manager to work with 
Tanya Tamarchenko on VAR and credit risk within the Houston Research Group, 
as we discussed on the phone yesterday.  I felt that it would be useful to 
bring Melanie Doyle, my HR rep, into the equation.  I met Melanie this 
morning to discuss the issues with respect to taking up the offer in 
Houston.  I explained that the interest for this opportunity is mutual, mine 
from a career progression perspective and Houston Research's to fill an 
urgent need.  Melanie, having had experience with these transfers before, has 
kindly agreed to help out from an HR perspective, probably involving some of 
the London/Houston team that are usually responsible for these situations.  I 
expect that you may receive a call from either Melanie or a foreign 
assignment representative in the near future.

I would like to re-iterate my interest in the opportunity, but would like to 
make a counter-proposal for the form of the contract; I would like to make 
the suggestion that we make this opportunity a one-year assignment working 
with Tanya, and then re-evaluate the situation at the end of the year in 
terms a new role for me in Houston thereafter, subject to mutual agreement.  
The alternative situation of resigning from Enron Europe and re-joining Enron 
Corp is too dramatic and requires me to "burn bridges" and my return to Enron 
Europe would be difficult.  Also, I would lose the valuable support 
structures available to me in London.  The amount of any fixed costs 
(flights, modest cargo, a few months of mortgage carrying cost) are entirely 
reasonable, not excessive given my single status and not so great that they 
justify making the contract a three year (local) one.

I would expect that on the basis of almost 3 1/2 years solid experience & 
value-added at Enron Europe, the value of several million pounds I have 
identified & justified to external auditors for Enron Europe this year and an 
"Excellent" rating (my fourth making my 3 1/2 yr average rating also 
"Excellent"), I could reasonably be expected to justify a fair deal (i.e. my 
existing Enron Europe salary & benefits package plus a reasonable one-off 
allowance to cover unavoidable additional personal expenses).

Regards & thanks again for the opportunity,

Anjam

Thank you very much.
I would rather talk to your group on Sep the 12th (Tuesday). 
I hope I will be entitled to disturb them again during the rest of the week 
as well.
We can certainly go out for dinner. Steven mentioned a Brazilian restaurant he
went to and I am looking forward going there. This in case you are not 
vegetarian.

Thanks again,

If you can dedicate one day to meeting the members of the Research Group I
could arrange a series of meetings with different units.

What about Sep the 11th or Sep the 12th (Monday or Tuesday)?

If you are free one evening we can have dinner together.

Subject: Introduction meeting : RAC London Quants and Houston Research


Vince,

I work for the Market Risk RAC London group. I review the quantitative issues 
arising from Enron Europe models.
I am in this function given my background (PhD from Imperial College-London) 
and also due to my past experience
as risk manager for a brazilian investment bank and Louis Dreyfus.

My agenda includes the review of a number of deals (Wessex, TPL, Eastern, 
...), as well as the 
review of the construction of european gas and power price curves and their 
respective volatility curves.
Currently I am devoting most of my time to the analysis of the UK gas market, 
its respective
price curve and term structure of volatility. 
Bjorn and David suggested it could be very productive if I had the chance to 
meet you and your team
to discuss issues related to modelling prices and risk measurement tools.
 
I will be in Houston from the 10th to 15th September. I wonder if you could 
book some time for me in
your agenda and also ask some members of your team to do the same.

Thanks,

Rodrigo

Chris,

E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weather 
group.

Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense 
for Research to charge his expenses
to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to 
different sub-units of GM.

Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London 
with Mike Roberts.
We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

Vince

I trust things are well in Houston.

The reason for contacting you is to inquire as to your schedule during the 
week
commencing Monday 18th September.   I and several of my colleagues would very
much like to meet up with you, however, we are tied up at a large conference
between Tuesday through to Friday of that week.

Is there any chance in meeting with you on Monday 18th?  If so, I will brief 
you
more fully on our people and will contact you to discuss an agenda.

Regards, ALLAN

Subject: Re: Confidential  

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

bonus or incremental bonus?

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

Vince, Dale

Here are our proposals for Houston visits from our group:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.
Matt  Not a permanent Research Group member.  I'm asking Richard's group to 
pay for his visit, probably in August.

Steve

Hi Vince

I met with Thomas this morning (I gave you his CV before, though I don't know 
if you had time to read it).  He's extremely interested in moving to Enron, 
and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research, 
although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.  He 
remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but 
wants to look at new markets and products.  I think we should seriously 
consider hiring him.  He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston, 
but there's no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives 
pricing (and thinking) here in London.

Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple 
of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?  I'm meeting with him again 
on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by Lane at King's 
College.  I've attached his CV for your reference.

All the best,
Steve

Ben

Thanks for attending. I was on "vacation" last week (driving from Ca to 
Houston)
and could not answer your first message regardoing Insead conference in time.

The objective was to find out more about the he Workshop on High-tech 
acquisitions 
and evaluate the usefulness of the program for Enron. I shall be making a 
recommendation
to Jeff Skilling that we should work with Wharton as a partner in a number of
different research projects.

I shall try to catch you next week to find out what was said about valuation 
of  small high-tech firms.

Vince

Vince

I attended the Workshop on High-tech acquisitions at Insead on Saturday 
alongside participants from Cisco, EADS, Razorfish and Cable+Wireless, and 
academics from Insead and Wharton. The basic premise was to discuss and get 
feedback from practitioners about the Research Project, and a PhD study which 
is currently underway at Wharton. The discussions were very interesting - 
especially as this was my first exposure to this area. 

Examples of the discussions raised include
why firms acquire new businesses instead of developing them in-house
what degree of post-acquisition integration was optimal
difficulties of US firms acquiring Euro/Asian high-tech companies
how to value small high-tech firms
how to quantify the success/failure of an acquisition

My feeling is that further work with them in this area would be beneficial to 
Enron because it would help the development of the academic research and give 
us first-hand access to the results. Plus it would enable us to learn from 
the mistakes of others, through meeting practitioners at such workshops and 
having greater access to the case studies. I guess it could also aid our 
realignment within the high-tech/communication industry to be seen in such 
studies.

Regards

Ben

Hi Shirley,

[I just called Vince now as you said]

As promised, below are the final dates - it looks like we'll have to move the
dates back as there is no way I can be in Houston as early as June as I have
commitments already booked - there is a chance in early or mid July, but I'd
rather stay flexible and therefore will opt for a hotel to be expensed in 
London
later.

Matthew Williams         Mon 31st July through Friday 18th August
Steve Leppard            Mon 21st Aug through Fri 15th Sep
Kirstee Hewitt           Mon 18th Sep through Friday 13th Oct
Ben Parsons              Mon 16th Oct through Friday 10th Nov

I think the best thing would be to arrange for the period Saturday 29th July 
to
Sunday 12th November to cover the travel arrangements at each end.

Thanks,

Anjam

Vince,
Steve Leppard informed my today that he will be moving to Enron Metals.  I 
think that leaves a leadership hole in Research here.  When that happens in a 
place like this, resources get diverted to the squeakiest wheel.  Do you have 
any advice?  I am concerned that London continues to lag behind in the 
implementation and analysis of VaR - most commodities are on spreadsheets and 
there is not a lot of attention on calibration, analyzing output, refining, 
improving etc..
pls advise

Deal all,

Please find attached a copy from a presentation on UK inflation we gave this 
morning to John Sherriff, President & COO Enron Europe. It summarizes the 
results of our work on inflation so far. As you know the long term models 
still remain to be approved. As today is quarter end and there is a 
significant P&L effect on a MTM basis John Sherriff would like to proceed as 
soon as possible with the new curves. 

Thank you all for all your help!

Best regards,

Martina

Hi Vince

I met with Thomas this morning (I gave you his CV before, though I don't know 
if you had time to read it).  He's extremely interested in moving to Enron, 
and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research, 
although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.  He 
remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but 
wants to look at new markets and products.  I think we should seriously 
consider hiring him.  He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston, 
but there's no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives 
pricing (and thinking) here in London.

Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple 
of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?  I'm meeting with him again 
on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by Lane at King's 
College.  I've attached his CV for your reference.

All the best,
Steve

All -

Our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to 
provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [5,000 by year-end]. 
Most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information, 
making the challenge harder, and the end result more important in terms of 
competitive pricing advantage. What we need is an overall strategy for how we 
plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective.

Currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under 
development:
FMC Model (default probability approach). Using Bloomberg's Fair Market (par 
yield) Curves, probabilities are generated from the risky-LIBOR, then 
default/bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology.
FMC Model (credit spread approach). Using the FMCs, then directly taking the 
LIBOR credit spread at each tenor, adjusting for basis and compounding 
differences.
Bond Model (FMC approach). Taking the FMCs as benchmark curves, the model 
regresses the input bonds (specific to a name) on the two best fitting 
benchmarks. The result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the FMCs, 
but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer. Prices are then generated 
using both spread and probability approaches. Under testing.
Bond Model (spline approach). Taking only the bonds specific to an issuer, 
the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero-coupon price curve, 
then builds a zero yield curve from this. Under testing.
Market Prices. For certain liquid names, or sectors/ratings, CDS market 
prices are used, then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap 
prices.
KMV. Using Expected Default Frequencies (EDFs) from the KMV model and 
database, we will build a model to price default swaps, making appropriate 
risk adjustments. KMV is being installed now, so model will be worked on next.

Each of these models returns a price (credit default and bankruptcy), and the 
accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory 
differences between bond and CDS markets, recovery assumptions, risk premia, 
capital charges, etc. The aim will be to accurately price as many liquid 
names as possible, based upon these models, then use these prices, alongside 
other financial information, as the backbone to a full automated pricing 
system. 

Our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and 
market prices for all issuers, alongside name-specific 'soft' data from 
credit reports and financial statements. If the credit is liquid enough, a 
price will be generated from their own information only. Otherwise, the 
credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits, with financial 
information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights. 
The model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with 
market (or trader) prices, and this adjustment will feed back into the 
weighting and mapping composition. In loose terms, we could think of the 
system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid 
market prices (bonds, equities, default swaps), where the weightings are 
calibrated using credit analysis, financial ratios, etc.

The key steps to implementing such a system will be:
Establishing what exactly we want to 'predict' - is it a price, a rating, a 
probability, or a score? We will need a clean market history to calibrate to, 
which we only really have for ratings. We will then need to develop a mapping 
from rating/score to price.
Getting and cleaning the historical financial and credit data required to 
calibrate the model.
Building the mechanics of the model, ie, the calibration methodology. Neural 
nets/fuzzy logic seem the obvious candidates, but which exact methods and 
software packages to use?
Determining an automated methodology for mapping names with limited 
information into the model.
Getting the "true" market price, in order to feed back an error. At present 
such a price exists for very few credits.
Allocating resources to the development. McKinsey claimed such a system would 
take 6-10 man-months to develop.

Further ideas or comments are requested, as we need to develop our strategy 
asap. The model description above is fairly vague, as we don't yet have the 
knowledge needed to fill in the specific details. Further help will be 
especially required on this if we are to continue to move at 'internet speed'.

Regards

Ben

Dear all,

Shirley has kindly arranged the accommodation for these new dates - I'd be 
grateful if we could stick to the dates that you confirmed to me below as it 
will be next to impossible to change these again.  Of course, it should be 
fine for you to arrive a day early to lose your jet lag and depart a day late 
so that you get a full week in the office.

Matthew Williams   Mon 31st July through Friday 18th August
Steve Leppard   Mon 21st Aug through Fri 15th Sep
Kirstee Hewitt   Mon 18th Sep through Friday 13th Oct
Ben Parsons   Mon 16th Oct through Friday 10th Nov

Let me know if you have any more logistical questions - I might even be able 
to suggest some nice restaurants!  For cars, I think that is best arranged 
from London when the flight is booked.  By the way, you will all need a full 
UK drivers licence to hire the car and a passport with more than a six(?) 
months to go before expiry.

Shirley - would it be best to use the usual 3 coupons on the guest car park 
ticket method for parking?

Regards,

Anjam

I understand that you will be in London around 20 September.  Tom Lewthwaite 
has
asked me to arrange a meeting between you, Tom and Julian Leake.  I understand
that you have met Tom and Julian before.   I would also like to attend - I am 
a
manager in our UK Financial Services practice with responsibilty for Enron 
from
a UK financial services perspective.  We would like to discuss any risk
management concerns that you may have and any internal initiatives with which 
we
could assist.

If you are happy to meet, I would be grateful if you could let me know how you
to proceed (whether I should arrange timings with you, your secretary, someone
in London etc).  You can contact me on +44 20 7783 7446 (at Enron's London
offices) or on this e-mail address.

Kind Regards

Dale,

Thanks for the update. I fully concur with all the rankings.
It seems things are going well with the Research Group in
London and this is, to a very large extent, your contribution.

I think that Anjam has improved a lot. I don't think, however,
that he can run the group in the future. Steve emerged as a natural
leader and has overwhelming support in the organization.

Vince

Vince,

We had the PRC preranking for RAC and Research in London yesterday.  Here's 
how everyone came out:

Steven - Superior:  No controversy here.  Steve received consistently strong 
feedback (ranked as either superior or excellent in all categories).  The 
only rough spot was teamwork, arising from the friction between Anjam and 
himself.


Anjam - Excellent:  Anjam received rankings of Superiors or Excellents in all 
categories.  Several reviewers commented that Anjam's performance in the 
areas of producing results in a timely manner and communication have 
improved.  I felt the overall ranking of excellent was justified based on 
this feedback, even though in terms of leadership I don't rate him high 
enough to run the group here.

Stinsen provided the most insightful comment on Anjam's performance:  
"Technically superior but lets his quest for a leadership position detract 
from his overall performance".

On a related topic, Anjam has been taking random days off, typically on short 
notice, so I suspect he's interviewing for a new job.  Given his inability to 
work with Steven (especially in the future when Stephen heads the group), 
this may be the best long-term solution.  Any thoughts?  


Ben - Superior:  Another non-controversial ranking.  Ben received 
consistently high marks from all the groups he supports, especially in the 
area of non-technical skills.

I nominated Ben for promotion to Senior Specialist.  Even though he was 
promoted at year end, he's taken on a lot of responsibility training Kirstee 
and helping manage the other quant resources in Brian's group.  Also, since 
Kirstee was hired in at the same level as Ben, a mid-year promotion is 
appropriate since he's effectively her supervisor.


Kirstee - Strong:  Only limited feedback in the 2 months she's been here.  
High marks for technical/quantitative, strong in the "soft" skills.  I think 
the strong rating is the right message for early in the game - gives her a 
target for improvement for the rest of the year.


- Dale

Dear All,

Attached is the spreadsheet "BenzeneCurves.xls" (also available in 
S:\RESEARCH\GLOBALPRODUCTS) that will hopefully allow you to derive a 
mid-curve for Benzene based upon our existing naphtha curve produced by 
Tracy.  The previous hedge ratio analysis is still part of the new 
spreadsheet.

For clarity a graph of the curve based on 1996 through 2000 data is depicted 
below:



I can also provide confidence bands on the regression model, if this can 
assist in deciding the bid-offer spread for the forward curve, but this is 
slightly more involved - let me know you'd like this.

Regards,

Anjam

Kevin/Karin:

My understanding from Vince is that London is reponsible for the expenses 
incurred while their people are here for training, as well as for any of our
people that go to London at their request.

It should be easy for them to expense this airfare for Steve from their office
and charge it to whatever cost center Tony is going to be under in London.

With regards to Tony's airfare ticket, which has been put onto Steve Leppards 
credit card as Tony hasn't got an Amex yet, could you please let me know who 
is responsible for payment?  I guess it is your costcentre, if so please

Dale,

My recommendation is to make Steve the head of the research unit in London.
We were talking originally about September but I think we should accelerate 
this process.
Of course, Anjam will be very unhappy about it, but we cannot manage around 
him
any longer.

I think that the promotion should be combined with a salary increase.
I would like to offer him a significant increase that
goes with expanded responsibilities and much higher visibility.
A salary increase will also bring him closer to the market.
 We see the market for  technical people going through the roof in 
practically every location
where we operate.

A contract is not a good solution in my view. It creates a sense of false 
security for
both an employee and the company.

I shall send a message to John Sherriff with my recommendation. I shall cc 
you.
I would appreciate if you could bring it up with John as well.

Vince

Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a 
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to 
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with 
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant 
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and 
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not 
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token 
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for 
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to 
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy 
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at 
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater 
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) 
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of 
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer 
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually 
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

Dale

Steve,

The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
than RISK MAgazine.

If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
accomplishment.

On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
among the practitioners.

I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

Mark,

I have an inquiry from a publishing house who are preparing a book on the 
world power markets.
They wanted us to sponsor it (at the cost of 19,000 pounds) but the reaction 
from our power desks
was  lukewarm.

They are offering us an opportunity to advertise in this publocatio.
 I am attaching the message with the terms.

Vince

Hi Vince

Do you think you will be able to find the time to carry out some interviewing 
on Monday 21st February?  Are there any times you'd particularly like me to 
avoid?

The first people I'm inclined to invite in are the candidates whose CVs I've 
attached below.  I'd like to hear what you think before I invite them along.

Vince,

Maureen asked me to pass along her message that the meeting with Brook/Hunt 
went very well today.  She said this firm is top-notch and very thorough.

She will contact you tomorrow after her speech on metals is over (planned for 
the lunch hour).

Hi Vince,

Following up to our chat on the phone.

Gordian Kemen will be arriving in Austin on the 16th. He will be staying in 
Austin for 2 weeks. He would very much appreciate to have the opportunity to 
have a talk with you to find out if there is a place for him at Enron. You 
can reach him under (512) 301-9819 (his parents in law's phone number). 

Thanks a lot for you help and attention,

Jens

Presumably if the Eastern Credit Reserve issues take lots of his time away 
from EnronCredit, we could extend his stay for another week? Especially as 
it's unlikely we could get Vasant over in the foreseeable future.

Bryan,

Just FYI - Amitava will be diverted for an unspecified portion of his stay 
here next week.

The did the initial coding for software / pricing systems used to value the 
Eastern deal.  There are over-riding concerns there I  or Steve L. can fill 
you in on if you like.  Problem could be Monday morning or all week.

We could press for Vasant to re-prioritize his time. 

Any thoughts?  I haven't checked with Ben about impacts yet...

Ben?

Hi Vince,

Thank you for offering the opportunity in Houston to me last week.  I guess I 
would interested to discuss it further with you -  one question I have is 
about which commercial groups within the Houston office you were looking for 
additional Research coverage on?  Please let me know when you might be free 
to talk - the best times for me would be from between 12pm and 5pm Houston 
time (I am usually home from 3pm Houston time).

Regards,

Anjam

Hi Tanya

Thanks for your time last week - I've been travelling a bit but I'm now back 
in London at MG to commence obtaining information for you.

I'm not really sure where to start on this, so initially I propose to get:

a complete data set (i.e. all live trades from all entities) which includes 
prices and volatilities
a separate file of options 
any written valuation methodologies used by the core systems

There is a project to obtain a data feed from an MG system called Mercur.  
This is their risk management system but we are proposing to use it along the 
lines of a data warehouse, not a risk system.  I'd be happy to talk you 
through any other current issues.

Let me know if there's anything else you need at present.

Regards

Hi,


	This email is in reference to our plan for detailed discussions about Enron Credit's modeling strategy.  Several meetings have already been scheduled.  Please refer to the attached Excel spreadsheet for further details.


	Also, if you like, we can have more informal discussions over lunch, dinner, drinks, etc.

	Thanks in advance for your time.

Hi guys

I need some advice.

Sharad is in the process of finding differences between your and our versions 
of Exotica.  At some point we will need to migrate London office over to your 
more up-to-date version, and I'm concerned that there may be RAC-style 
implications.  I'm in favour of using the IT testers to carry out formal 
regression testing, and they are apparently able to do this.

Do we need to get our heads together to "form a view" before we involve RAC 
or the business groups?

Anjam tells Sharad that London Exotica was built using Excel 95, and that 
neither he nor Zimin knows how to build/compile the XLA using later versions 
of Excel.  Is this true?  If so, then we need to migrate to XLLs sooner 
rather than later because of the maintenance implications.

Steve

Hi Vince,

One of my only windows of opportunity right now is to schedule the Houston 
visit for Monday 10th July for a single week only.

Regards,

Vince, Dale

Here are our proposals for Houston visits from our group:
Kirstee  All of July, all of September. (Kirstee's personal commitments mean 
she needs to be in the UK for August.)
Ben  All of October.   (No crossover with Kirstee, ensures VaR/Credit cover 
in London office.)
Steve  2-3 weeks in July, first 3 weeks of September.
Anjam  To be arranged at Anjam and Houston's mutual convenience.
Matt  Not a permanent Research Group member.  I'm asking Richard's group to 
pay for his visit, probably in August.

Steve

Anita,

Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the stay.
I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and Amitava, based
on the business need.

One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.

Vince

I am making reservations for Iris to leave for London on Monday, April 30, 2001.  Iris said you want her to stay 2 weeks and Vasant wants her to stay 1 week.  I can have her return on Friday, April 11, 2001 or Tuesday, May 15, 2001.   Her only request is that she return before May 17, 2001 when Professor Kulatilaka from Boston University is here.    When do you want her to return?  

Thanks.  Anita

Chris,

E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weather 
group.

Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense 
for Research to charge his expenses
to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to 
different sub-units of GM.

Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London 
with Mike Roberts.
We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

Vince

Hi Vince,

Talking to the staff in London, I heard that Lynda Clemmons and a few of the 
key Weather Desk members left to start their own business.  I am hearing that 
London may gain more independence from Houston and gain its own book and, 
interestingly, also having ideas about developing the insurance/ insurance 
derivatives market.  I therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity 
to formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing 
from Joe to myself plus start talking to Vasant about the new markets on the 
insurance side.  I will call you later to discuss this with you.

Regards,

Anjam

I am calling Anjam to give him a deadline regarding move to Houston.
If he decides to stay in Houston, you should meet with him to convey
the concerns regarding his performance.

Subject: Support for Exotica

All

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

Thanks a lot for your note - I think it would be great to see what we can do 
to help you & Joe's business units.  Plenty of our knowledge is no longer 
proprietary in that quite a lot of this information is now in the public 
domain - we can sit down and discuss this on Thursday afternoon if that works 
for you.

Hi Anita,

	How are you?  I arrived yesterday late morning from the London Gatwick airport.  Due to rush hour traffic, etc. it took a while to get into the city to the hotel.

	Also, due to May Day (May 1st) protests/riots, etc., the hotel management strongly recommended that we remain in the hotel.  

	However, I am in the office today.  I can be reached via email or via telephone at 44 (0) 207 783 5647.

Take care,
Iris

Following Steve's note to you earlier today, I wanted to mention that we have 
a fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular, as there 
is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days.

I am not sure what data you have received from Enron Metals in London, so I 
am asking Tim Poullain-Patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the 
economic justification proposed as soon as possible.  Please direct any 
questions to him or to Harry Tefoglou.  I will be in the Tokyo office next 
week, but available via e-mail.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,

Hi Vince

Thanks for the chat earlier today.  Slava is out this coming week (5th-9th 
March), then I'll be out for the next two weeks (12th-23rd March).  I expect 
we'll both be around from 26th March onwards, though I will be away again at 
Paris Risk 10th-11th April.

Cheers,

Hi Kate,

Thanks for setting up the telephone informal discussion with Sharad so that I 
can make him more comfortable with what's on offer - I really think it will 
make the difference.  As you mentioned, the agency fee goes up from 25% to 
30% at 50,000, hence the offer of 49,000.  I guess, as you mentioned, we can 
keep in reserve the possibility of an element of sign on bonus to get him 
over the decision hump.

Regards & Thanks,

Anjam

Vince,

Margaret mentioned to me that you might be able to help me with the 
followings:

We (Central European Origination, London office) might start talking to two 
aluminium companies in Central Europe.  Before we were to meet them, it would 
be rather useful (I suppose) to find out what aluminium deals (if any) you 
closed in the States.  The most important issue would be whether you managed 
to index the price of power to the price of aluminium; if yes, how.

Your help would be much appreacited.

Many thanks,

Jozsef

Dear Richard,

Thanks for your message - I just met Lloyd Fleming who is setting up meetings 
for me and getting me some of the information requested.  Houston Research 
has started on this process, but I believe that I will take over from here - 
I am in Houston in 10 days time and will also discuss initial findings with 
them.

Regards,

Subject: MG Metals: Additional Areas to Look at

Dear Lloyd & Richard,

I have been discussing with Eric Gadd about two particular areas of concern 
that will affect the London Research Group.  I believe there are a number of 
issues to address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk 
management and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a 
(by no means exhaustive) list:-

i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic 
options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option 
pricing add-ins)
ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we 
can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data 
for this).  I am sure Bjorn will be looking to the Research Group to assist 
in this matter.
iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our 
methods and systems and vice versa

These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with 
relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the 
process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative 
research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes 
smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to 
involve me.

Best regards,

Hi Vince

I'd originally been told you wouldn't be back until Wednesday, and so have 
another meeting booked for 4:30pm (London time) today.  I really need to 
speak with you about the situation here in London re Anjam.  To be blunt, 
Sharad, Kirstee and I have all been tempted to just walk out of the office 
until Anjam is removed.  The major problems are:
1. I have no authority to demand Anjam should cooperate with Sharad, Kirstee 
etc. on their work.  He does his best to impede their work, and I have no 
ability to access his drives for data/spreadsheets.
2. Anjam removes me from the cc lists in reply to all emails received by him, 
in an attempt to remove me from the loop.
3. Anjam continues to "do business", and people in London still think he's 
head of Research.
4. Pending your "announcement", people will continue to go to Anjam, and the 
business will remain dependent on him.
5. We're severely under-resourced.  I'm still awaiting your review of the 
email I drafted for John S, requesting additional resource.  I can't make a 
big recruitment drive until I have the authority to hire more.
I honestly feel I can't do my job, and I'm currently asking myself what I'm 
even doing here.

Notwithstanding the above, here is the current picture with our projects:

Steve
1. Initiated new pre-trade system for oil trading desk.  Hooked up relevant 
IT resource with business people, keeping an overall eye on making sure the 
business reqts get translated into IT-speak.
2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review.
3. Initiated global supply/demand database with coal group.
4. Constant firefighting across all desks.

Ben
1. Work on regression-based placement model.
2. General review of EnronCredit.com's quant models.

Matthew
1. Ongoing work with EnGOAL.
2. Produced first prototype of gas capacity charge optimisation tool for 
Continental Gas desk.  Need to purchase local copy of CPLEX.

Kirstee
1. Diverted from Richard Lewis's request for the UK gas/power vol curves to 
be sorted out, onto Eastern Virtual Power Station restructuring project.  
Involves extension runs of credit reserve model, and now it seems the model 
needs to be extended.
2. Constant VaR firefighting.

Slava
1. Finished all regressions and model identification for UK gas and power 
demand forecasting.  We are now ready to start IT implementation.
2. Enron Direct demand forecasting system review.

Sharad
1. Exotica support/firefighting, made nearly impossible by Anjam.
2. Option on strip of metals futures for Enron Metal.

I do hope we get a chance to speak and resolve some of these issues.  I'm 
really not happy at present.

Best regards,
Steve

Subject: Budget

Hi Dale

Following discussions with Vince, Grant and Stinson, we've drawn up the 
proposed budget.  We're working on the basis that Research Group headcount 
will grow to 8 in the near future.

Business trips US: 8
Business trips Europe: 10

Computer software and licences: GBP 10,000
Office postage: GBP 350
Employee recruitment fees: GBP 30,000 ( = 3 x 20% x GBP 50,000)
Professional subscriptions and memberships AND books: GBP 15,000
Training courses: GBP 16,000 ( = 8 x GBP 2,000)
Conferences: GBP 8,000 ( = 4 x GBP 2,000)
Mobile phones: GBP 1,500 ( = 3 x GBP 500 = me + 2 floaters)
Hardware: GBP 10,000 ( = laptops, workstations)

Suggested allocation as follows...
RAC 20%
UK Power 20%
UK Gas 5%
Continental Power 20%
Continental Gas 5%
Global products 10%
EBS 10%
EES 10%
...unless you've got any other views on this one (I'm happy to take advice 
here).

Vince has said you can give him a call if you want to discuss any of these 
points further, but I'm happy to field initial queries (I'll have to get used 
to it!).

Cheers,
Steve

Hi Eric,

Thanks for getting back to me - I believe there are a number of issues to 
address to ensure that the integration goes smoothly from a risk management 
and quantitative analysis perspective, and I have put together a (by no means 
exhaustive) list:-

i) seamless transfer of front and middle office systems from an exotic 
options linking perspective (e.g. their spreadsheets link to different option 
pricing add-ins)
ii) development of volatility curves and factor analysis to ensure that we 
can capture metals risk in our VaR system (we will require historical data 
for this).
iii) ensure that MG staff on quant and risk side become familiar with our 
methods and systems and vice versa

These tasks will involve a significant degree of cross-communication with 
relevant contacts within MG metals, and so I look forward to starting on the 
process as soon as possible - I hope to play a full part from a quantitative 
research and risk management perspective to ensure that everything goes 
smoothly in this exciting new development, so please do not hesitate to 
involve me.

Best regards,

Dear Eric,

I understand from Dale that you are co-ordinating the integration of MG 
Metals into Enron Europe.  Dale and I thought it would be a good idea to 
ensure that we are fully prepared from a quantitative research and 
structuring perspective so that we can "hit the ground running" when they do 
arrive.  I would be grateful if you could provide a contact person in MG 
metals that may look after this area, or someone who may find it useful to 
discuss and identify their possible future modelling requirements. 

Thanks & regards,

All

Following discussions between Matt, Vince Kaminski, and me, Matt has decided 
he'd like to make a longer-term commitment to Research.  With this in mind 
we'd like to request that Matt is switched from A&A to the Specialist track.  
Vince and I feel this is clearly in the best interests of Enron given Matt's 
proven strengths in quant analysis.

How do we proceed?

All the best,
Steve

Subject: Equity investment Fair Value in Turkey

Vince,

John Sherriff recommended that I contact you regarding an interesting (and 
potentially contentious) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with 
in London.  We hold longish term options in a private company in Turkey which 
is currently seeking to IPO.  The issue we are discussing with RAC is which 
discount rate (i.e., risk-free? and if so Turkish or US?) should we use to 
value these options

First, some additional information.

Option characteristics:
-- 116,000 options (representing 9% of the company)
-- Term:  minimum of 3 years but possibly longer -- still being renegotiated
-- Strike price:  20% below the upcoming IPO price (either priced in US$ or 
Turkish Lire)

We currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $118.75 
per option but 34,800 expire on July 15, 2000 with the remainder expiring on 
December 15, 2000.  The company's investment bankers (ABN / AMRO Rothchilds) 
are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at 
$118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $300 million.  Due 
to such a large "valuation gap", they originally encouraged us to exercise 
all of the options by the end of June (IPO target date in late Sept / early 
Oct).  Our counter-proposal is to "swap" instrinsic value for time value by 
repricing the options strike higher while extending their term.

We are currently negotiating with RAC the most appropriate discount rate to 
use to value the options.  We are arguing that the US risk free is the most 
appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company's 
historical senior debt cost (18%) is the more appropriate number to use 
(although admit that this is not justifiable -- only a proxy)

A few key points:
-- RAC is valuing the options via Crystal Ball simulations such that this "to 
be negotiated" discount rate is used to calculate the PV of the future 
options intrinsic value in 3 years
 (i.e., for Black-Scholes, a higher discount rate yields a higher value but 
the opposite is true using Crystal Ball simulation)
-- The model simulates both an IPO / no IPO case and in the case of no IPO we 
have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17% return
-- The model assigns a 30% illiquidity discount
-- In the simulated cases where the options are out-of-the-money, we 
obviously do not exercise.

We understand that for Black-Scholes option valuation, one needs to be able 
to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and 
the risk free in order for the valuation to hold.  And here is where we reach 
our difficulty:  since the company doesn't currently trade on a public market 
and since equity futures do not exist for Turkish equities, RAC is arguing 
that a US risk free is not appropriate to use.  Our argument is that the 
non-IPO scenario, a 30% illiquidity discount and a US$ based option 
volatility are already in the factored into the simulation.  As such, we feel 
RAC's approach is double counting.

If you managed to get through the above, your a patient man!  I'll give you a 
call today or tomorrow after you've had a chance to digest the information.

Regards,
John Bottomley

Subject: Support for Exotica

All

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

Karin,

I talked to Mike Roberts (the head of the whole weather team), and he is 
saying that all expenses for Tony should be charged to Global Products Team. 
This is agreed between Vince and Jeff Shankman.
Mike and Vince are negotiating with John to put Stephen (or somebody who will 
replace him) to some other cost centres (via research).

It looks like Kevin Moore is happy if Stephen is charged to the same cost 
centre as Tony.
Let us right now charge Tony and Stephen to the cost centre below .
Please, could we charge them separately - when John and Vince make their 
decision, we should be able to re-charge.

many thanks,

Slava

should be charged to the same cost center as Tony Hamilton,
reason being, is that someone will replace you in that position.

Hi Karin...

I hope you had a splendid holiday!  I wanted to thank you for getting Tony 
and I set up here last week.  We seem to have established a steady daily 
routine and are supporting several different trading groups in London as well 
as continuing our daily support of traders in Houston.  We've gotten far more 
requests for information than we expected, so as a result I will be remaining 
in London a little longer than originally expected.  As of now - I'm not sure 
exactly when I'll be going back to Houston - but Vince has let me know that I 
will remain here as long as necessary to ensure adequate daily weather 
support for the London traders.  

To that end - I think I will need one additional piece of software installed 
on the machine that I will be using on a regular basis.  Could I please get 
Microsoft FrontPage installed as soon as we can get it?  

That leads to the second issue of desks.  I know that space is a premium here 
- and I understand that I may need to move around some as a result.  I 
certainly want keep things as simple as possible for everyone - but I also 
wanted to make sure that you know that there are certain applications that 
are essential for the daily trader support in London and Houston.  As such, 
if I move, we will need to make sure that these applications are available 
from the beginning of the day (we start about 0600).  The applications are:

1)  Adobe Acrobat - Full Version
2) AccuWeather For Windows - (This is something I will need to install)
3) Microsoft Front Page
4) Terminal Server
5) The full MS Office software package

One idea would be to have a PC move with me - that way we would not need to 
reinstall this software which could cause problems with the daily support 
routine.

Thanks again for all of your help.  I will let you know - once I know - how 
long I will be here.  I should hear something from Vince over the next few 
days giving me an idea.  

Cheers,
Steve

Vince:

Here is an explanation of what a 12 month package for Anjam actually entails.
It seems to me that Anjam's interest in getting an expat package is mostly 
about money.   Based on the UK HR's read of Anjam, they think he will jump.  
I have a telephone conference with Anjam at 11:00.  My stance will be 110 is 
firm. We will help with the transition via a one time settlement:  flat 
rental issues, 500lbs of air shipping for moving furniture, maybe one trip 
back to UK a year, but no more.  Re: his concerns of having a place in London 
should he want to return, I will say that Vince would be far better at 
finding a good spot for you than any HR type, so that part of the "package" 
promise is not particularly important. 

Any guidelines for me to follow, coach?

Regards,
Grant.

Grant

Not sure if I told you that I work Mon, Wed, Friday hence the delay in 
responding. Sorry if I forgot to tell you! Another contact name in my absence 
who will be able to assist is Jane Allen in Houston (cc'ed above).

Three main reasons we try to stay away from assignments to the US for this 
type/level of transfer are: 1)cost 2)equitability among other peers 
3)difficulty in transferring employee to local package from assignment 
package. However, if this is truly a 12 month assignment with no intention of 
extension, we would normally do the following:

12 month assignment
London base, car allowance,  and benefits and National Insurance contribution 
costs (currently 12.2% of all comp compared with 1.45% of all comp plus 6.2% 
up to max of $76K of employers US contribution)
Housing costs in Houston paid if maintaining housing in the UK (usually up to 
$1800 per month for single)
Utility costs if maintaining a house in the UK - up to $100 per month
Home Leave - two economy trips per year is standard
Transportation to/from assignment - economy class
Transportation in Houston - we normally give this - up to $40 per day for 
rental car in addition to the person's car allowance as they normally do not 
require a car in the UK and take the car allowance as a cash benefit whereas 
they will require a car  in Houston.
Shipment of goods  - 500lbs air
Tax Assistance 
Disturbance allowance - normally pay approx $1000 

So, in terms of costs if you just compare a local US salary of Manager on 
$100K to a local UK Manager on o68K the US total cost is approx $120K. The UK 
cost is approx $230K. Then if you add the above costs to the assignment, you 
will see an even greater increase in cost compared with the local peers, ie 
approx $280K compared with $120K. We do have the ability to change the above 
in any way as there is no set policy; however, Anjam has already brought up 
other people's assignments and I have a feeling he will do his best to find 
out what everyone else is receiving. If we make clear, though, that we are 
keeping on UK payroll but not providing any assignment type allowances just 
in order for him to maintain his pension contributions for the year and at 
which point a decision will need to be made (returns or moves to local US), 
then we may be able keep more consistency with your group while maintaining 
more reasonable costs. Not sure how you want to play this, though.

Even if he does go on assignment rather than transfer locally, there is still 
the issue of whether or not a suitable job will be here at the end of the 12 
months. We will always do our best to find suitable postions but we cannot 
guarantee it. If he transfers to a local US contract, Enron Europe's 
responsibility of finding suitable employment is pretty much nil.

I hope this has made things clearer rather than more complicated. I honestly 
feel that Ajnam will absolutely not take this position if it is not on an 
assignment basis. He made it pretty clear that unless he could stay on UK 
payroll for 12 months, he would not transfer.

Call me if you would like to discuss.

Thanks for the update. It seems Anjam is playing hard ball a little. My 
initial reaction is to be inflexible because it is a good offer, but on 
second thoughts, could you please give me an idea of what is meant by a 
12-month assignment when you have a moment?  Compensation, benefits, 
responsibilities, career path implications, etc.

Many thanks!

Bryan,

We shall be glad to  take a look at the system. To sign - off on the vendor 
provided system we
have to look under the hood and review the algorithms. I hope the vendor will 
have no objections to it.

Another critical issue we have to solve on a short notice is to integrate the 
system you want to buy
with the rest of VaR/credit systems. We shall stand by to help in this 
endeavor.

An alternative approach is to evaluate to what extent your positions can be 
rolled into the existing risk systems.

Vince/Steve -- we are going to the Board in December to ask for formal

Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our 
approach for calculating VaR.  We have implemented a third party risk system 
which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt 
positions in.  The system has a VaR engine which is being demo'd by the

John,

I propose accelerating Steve's move to head the Research group here.  It 
makes sense to include this as part of the mid-year PRC process by giving him 
a tangible reward along with his performance feedback.

Thoughts?

Vince - I agree with your conclusion here.  We are still trying to fill 
Dale's structuring role as well so part of the question is 
how we announce Steve's lead research role relative to when we know who will 
take Dale's spot.  Perhaps we should just
move forward with the Steve announcement the day that Dale moves full time to 
EBS.  I will ask Richard Lewis to take the lead
in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes 
to the organization.

But I do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have Steve here.  He is a 
wonderfull asset to our efforts.

Thanks!

John

Subject: London Research Group

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

Steve,

Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates
at low cost and low risk. I would take this person in,
assuming you can still run it by the Analyst/Associate program. They closed 
the books
for the summer.

Let me know if you run into any roadblock. I shall try help you from here.

Do you have any views on taking summer interns here in the Research group in 
London?  One of our Analysts has recommended a friend of hers (resume 
attached).  I'm sure we could dream up some work for an intern, so let me 
know what you think.

Many thanks,

Hi Maureen

I hope you're keeping well.  London Research has been asked to validate the 
long-term copper (and other) forward curves being used by MG.  Clearly this 
lies outside our domain of expertise (being economics), so I've referred Tani 
to you.

Speak to you soon,

We have established a set of power volatility curves down to the EFA/monthly 
level of detail that can be marked to market up to 6 years out.  Beyond this, 
the volatility decays to what we understand to be the long-term level for 
power volatility, given our understanding of the behaviour of forward prices 
over large time-scales.

The swaption traders can now fit the first 5-6 years of the volatility curve 
to the market-observed baseload swaption implied volatilities (typically 3 to 
12 months duration for the underlying swap) and then be in a good position to 
price other swaptions (including swaptions on individual EFA slots) 
consistent with the curve.  There may also be an impact on the daily VaR 
calculation.

An illustration of the current volatility curves is pasted below:-




These curves will be reset as the market moves, and allow a mark-to-market 
approach to be followed for our volatility book.  The spreadsheet model is 
saved in T:\READWRTE\ELEC_UK\MODELS\VOLCURVEGENERATORNEW.XLS and also 
attached below for Houston staff to review.




[Stinson - I'd be grateful if you could offer an opinion/audit to ensure that 
I haven't missed anything, thanks.]

I've just had a chat with Richard, who feels strongly that the natural 
synergies between, and independence of, Research and Structuring will be best 
served if I report to Tani.

I expressed my concerns that I want to keep a strong link with:
1. accountability to the trader sense of urgency, and
2. traders' willingness to spend money where necessary.

Richard suggested that we have a strong "dotted line" of reporting in to him, 
and that he will be available to support these areas.  We'll meet regularly 
to keep Richard in the loop.

I filled Richard in on the fact that I wish to change the nature, not just 
the size, of the Research Group, which will involve significant changes in 
headcount and investment in hardware/software.

I've no doubt that my main concerns of accountability and budget support will 
be met whether I report to Richard formally or informally.

Tani has indicated that she'd be prepared to have Research report to her if 
required.

All the best,
Steve

Hi Vince,

HR is working on a mid-year salary review for London people that have a 
noticeable gap between their compensation at Enron and what we would have to 
pay in the market for a replacement.  They highlighted Steve as someone with 
a potential gap - particularly in light of what we're seeing in our quant 
recruiting effort for credit trading and research.

I'd like your opinion on the best way to make sure we keep Steve happy and 
keep him at Enron.  There are several things I see we can do:

1)  Give him a mid-year pay increase to move him closer to market.  I'm not 
sure this is the best way to go, especially if we only offer him a token 
salary increase.

2)  Offer him more responsibility:  What are your thoughts on timing for 
making Steve the official head of the London research team?  With my move to 
EBS, should we accelerate this?  I think this is good way to keep him happy 
and motivated, and then follow up with a more meaningful salary review at 
year-end (as part of the regular process) that takes into account his greater 
responsibility.

3)  We have some people that we're trying to get under long-term (3-yr) 
contract with a 12-month notice clause.  Obviously anyone signing one of 
these will want significant up-front compensation for being handcuffed.  
We've not had a lot of success with these here in London, and I would prefer 
to keep Steve happy so he wants to stay with Enron rather than contractually 
binding him to the job.

I'd value your thoughts on this.

Thanks,

Dale

This morning a draft of RAC's Inflation Model Review was discussed with Anjam.

All points as presented in the draft were agreed upon.

Also, four new points were amended as suggested by Anjam:

The RPI short-term model could be improved by a combination of the 
information available from the GILTS and RPI Swaps market.
Add:  "This is an issue across all Enron's econometric models." to section 
PLLU and DZCV Short-term, First Point.
To implement some of the suggestions requires additional statistical and 
programming resources.
Additionnal human resources with advanced econometric modelling skills are 
required given the current workload of the european research team.

Please find the final version attached.

Please note that the short term solution has been to freeze the curve.

The medium to long term solution involves futher research towards a sounder 
and more efficient model.
Given the current workload of the European Research Group, it is necessary to 
hire a new member of staff with strong economics and econometrics background 
to address this issue properly.

RAC will communicate to the Financial Trading Group and Risk Management the 
actions to take as the curve will be frozen.

Thanks,

Rodrigo

Could you send me instructions?

Also as you are very busy and away from your desk could you set up your lotus

Hi Anjam,

I have quite a few questions/requests regarding the exotics libarary:




1)Could you e-mail me instructions for building/compiling  
S:\Research\Exotica\Excel\Exotica.xla 
Also if there is any more source code that I need please could you e-mail me 
that.

YOU HAVE ALL THE CODE (C & VBA) THAT MAKES UP THE LIBRARY NOW - PLEASE SEE 
PREVIOU E-MAILS

2)Also could you e-mail me documents on the changes you have made to  
S:\Research\Exotica\Excel\Exotica.xla

CHANGES ARE DOCUMENTED THROUGH ATERATIONS TO COMMENTS ON INDIVIDUAL SOURCE 
CODE FILES AS IS THe CURRENt METHOD IN HOUSTON AND As ADOPTED BY ME IN 
LONDON  - VERSION CONTROL OCCURS AT THE INDIVIDUAL FILE LEVEL RATHER THAN 
THROUGH SOIURCE SAFE

3)The exotica.xla used in London and exotica.xll used in Houston are quite 
different. What regression testing has been done?
How do we know if the two versions that we have been using produce the same 
results.

I HAVE NOT RECENTLY COMPARED THE XLL FROM HOUSTON WITH OUR XLA - THIS WOULD 
BE A USEFUL EXERCISE FOR YOU

4)Judging from the documentation there are quite a few more functions 
available on the Houston Exotica
like Asian spreads, quantos, digitals etc. Is there any reason why they have 
not been implemented in London's exotica.xla?

MAINTENANCE AND UPGRADES TO LONDON EXOTICA TO ENSURE COMPATABILITY WITH 
HOUSTON AND VICE VERSA IS AN ON-GOING PROCESS - INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE SOME 
LAG BETWEEN A NEW MODEL BEING IMPLEMENTED IN HOUSTON AND IN LONDON, AS IS THE 
CASE WITH ASIAN SPREADS AND DIGITALS.  QUANTOS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE - SEE 
VBA CODE.

Thanks in advance,
Sharad

Steve,

I shall call you tomorrow about it. My preference is to move Anjam to Houston
for some time. Anjam knows a lot about our business and specific positions
and it's better to prevent a potential leak. I have discussed this issue
with Dale and Richard  and  they concurred.

I don't  expect Anjam to act irrationally but it's better to be safe than 
sorry.

Hi Vince

If you're currently engaged in drawing up contingency plans for the Anjam 
situation, have you arranged for a "snapshot" of his computer directories to 
be taken?  We all tend to use our personal areas (on our H: drives) for 
development, and obviously there'll be a few years of work in Anjam's 
directories.  I wouldn't want him to wipe it all out in a fit of bad temper.  
Although our IT dept. obviously makes backups, I don't know how long they are 
kept for.

Cheers,
Steve

Vince,

I've been invited to speak at the conference below in Amsterdam in April. 
This is along with the Monte Carlo conference a week later which Stinson has 
forwarded my name for. Both are by EPRM, and shouldn't take too much time to 
prepare as will be on similar topics to the previous conference at which I 
spoke. Should I go to both, or start prioritising these events?

Hi Paul/Cassim,

Further to our meeting yesterday regarding power options, that we may use to 
capture short-term volatility from regulatory caps being adhered to or 
broken, I have attached a spreadsheet that should assist in nailing down the 
value.

ARBITRARY DISTRIBUTION
The first issue to address is converting the price scenarios for the average 
of the Q2-Q3 swap into a volatility equivalent.  This is achieved by fitting 
a normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard 
deviation.  The graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed 
yesterday.  In this example, the annualised volatility is coming up as 
approximately 23%.



PRICING & IMPLIED VOLATILITY
The pricing is as for a regular Asian option.  The payoff depends on the 
average of the daily prices for Spanish power for Q2 and Q3.  The valuation 
using 23% volatility is showing about 15.3 Pta per kWh.

I will schedule a meeting to allow us to take this forward.

Regards,

Anjam

I am so sorry for the late notice, but Vince will be in London for 1 day
only,
Monday, October 2nd.  He has had some time freed up and if Paul and
Julian could meet with him, they can call him at the Grosvenor House,
870-400-8500.  His morning is already full, but lunch, dinner or afternoon
would work.

Vince,

There are a few matters I'd like to discuss with you:

clarification on who Tony Harrison reports to ( I had understood it would be 
the Houston crude oil weather forecast team but I am not now sure)
to let you know that Joe wants to recruit a strongly mathematical 
macroeconomist reporting to Steve, and therefore that Maureen will be 
returning to Houston later this month
to talk about Stinson coming over for a visit

Regards,

Tani

Vince,

Bryan has been unable to find anyone suitable to attend this symposium on 
Saturday, so has suggested I attend, which I am happy to do. My only 
reservation is that my knowledge of this area is very limited, so it is 
likely I would just be an observer, rather than a participant. Anyway just so 
that I am adequately prepared could you briefly describe our current 
relationship with this project, and also suggest any reading, like a magazine 
or paper, that would quickly aid my understanding of the topics to be 
discussed.

Many thanks,

Ben

Bryan,

I shall  call you later today when I have a chance to read the message from 
Ben.

I wanted to ask you for a favor (on a very short notice). We are talking to 
the Wharton School
about setting up a relationship with them and getting involved in one or 
more  research projects
with them.

One of the potential  topics is emerging technologies. The Wharton offers  a 
symposium in Paris on June 10
 on High Tech Acquisitions  and it would make a lot of sense if you
(or somebody from London you could identify) could attend and help us to 
evaluate the usefulness
of this project.

I am enclosing the message from the person in Wharton running this program.


Vince

Vincent,

It was truly a pleasure getting to know you in our meeting yesterday, and I
look forward to the prospect of exchanging views in the future on a variety
of topics pertaining to emerging technologies.

Per our discussion, I've enclosed three files that include an invitation,
agenda and rsvp form for the June 10 symposium on High Tech Acquisitions at
Insead.  If you or the individual(s) who will be attending have any
questions, please email:  Phanish Puranam at: PHANIS20@WHARTON.UPENN.EDU or
you can call him at 215-898-1231.

This initiative will be expanded during the coming year and I believe that
Enron's involvement will give the company access to some of the early
research in progress as it unfolds, and of course, if you become involved
as a partner in the Emerging Technologies Program you would have
opportunities to help guide the direction of the research which is one of
the partnership "benefits."

Our next upcoming events are scheduled for:

Friday, September 8
"WHAT NEXT ON THE INTERNET?"
This is a faculty update day with industry partners also invited.
We will co-sponsor this with Wharton's major e-Business initiative.
Major issues addresses include "New Economics of the Web" and
"Internet, Anywhere."

Friday, October 20
"FIRST MOVER ADVANTAGE, SHAKEOUTS & SURVIVAL STRATEGIES"
Designed by the ET core group and
presented in collaboration with the e-Commerce Forum.

As I indicated during our discussion, participation in the Emerging
Technologies Management Research Program is by invitation and on behalf of
our core faculty, I am pleased to extend an invitation for Enron to join
the program.

To assist in your decision, we recommend having a representative attend the
symposium in Paris on June 10 to "test drive" the program.

I'll send you a formal invitation which you are free to accept at your
convenience, should you agree that Enron's participation in the ET Program
would be of value.

Please call or email if you have any comments or questions.

best regards,
Michael

Vince,

With regard to the softs curves development, I have been communicating with a 
couple of folks in London.  The key contacts include James Willis (cocoa and 
sugar broker) and Nigel Majury (coffee broker).  We had a conference call on 
Thursday (Heather, Trena, Erin, James, Nigel, Frank Speight, Nelson) to 
discuss data sources, data acquisition, priorities, and timelines.  A number 
of data sources were identified (e.g., USDA, Int'l Cocoa Organization, ED&F 
Man, Landell-Mills Commodities, etc.) and both the Houston and London offices 
have taken steps to obtain the information.  Curve development priorities 
were adjusted as well.  Raw sugar remains the top priority; however, cocoa 
replaces coffee in the softs importance hierarchy.  I suppose that this 
results from our physical (or soon to be) positions in both markets.  The 
timeline hasn't changed; however, adjustments will have to be made since we 
haven't yet acquired all of the necessary data for price modeling.  Moreover, 
per our discussion this afternoon, additional thought/time will have to be 
devoted to corn modeling to come up with an adequate hedging strategy.

Nelson

Subject: PPI Index Short-Term Models

Hi Martina & Trena,

I made a few minor changes to the models...  I reckon these models can be 
checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets) 
and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I 
became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether 
this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the 
forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:



Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just 
copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is 
not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable 
confidence.  As I mentioned, I don't think we can really run this model more 
than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the 
next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.

Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!

Regards,

Anjam

Dear Sven & Clemens,

I put together some packets of print outs from various links that I am 
familiar with; the packets cover electricity and gas markets and modelling, 
deregulation & exchanges, weather derivatives and value-at-risk/risk 
management/case studies.  This is by no means final, and I hope to supplement 
with some more ideas over the next few days.  Once you have considered the 
material, I can fine-tune the type of material that is relevant for you and 
then we can look at starting to put something together, after which we can 
pass on to Mike Roberts

If you need some simple articles on pricing options or an explanation on how 
to calculate volatility, then I am sure we can put that together for you.

Regards,

Anjam

Good talking with you this morning.  By all means, talk to Grant Masson abo=
ut=20
who else is using the Henwood model within Enron.

Attached are the workbooks I mentioned.  The "Details of Jan and July.xls"=
=20
workbook contains the resulting listing from the query I gave you yesterday=
=20
and you can see how the supply curve was created from that.  The supply cur=
ve=20
becomes nonsense at points for reasons I believe are related to reliability=
=20
commitment constrants, instead of pure economic dispatch, and to the=20
aggregate reporting problem I described in my note yesterday.

The workbook "Supply Curve.xls" has the simplistic, average supply curve I=
=20
mentioned, constructed from fuel and VOM costs.  Depending on the question=
=20
you are trying to answer, it may be an approach to consider.

The Henwood Contacts I had in mind are:

Tao Guo, PhD, Senior "Algorithmist"  (916-569-0985) =02=05 the one I was th=
inking=20
of
Wenxiong Huang, PhD Senior Project Consultant (916-569-0985)
Ajit Kulkarni, PhD, Software Product Manager (916-569-0985) =02=05 more a t=
rainer,=20

Cosimo Coscia, Senior Consultant (South Australia) 618-8357-1244 =02=05 ver=
y=20

Wade Schauer, Staff Consultant, (916-569-0985) =02=05 best for questions ab=

EMSS per se

all have emails, of course.  Template:  tguo@hesinet.com

Also, if you can not get satisfaction, contact Eric Toolson, VP=20

satisfaction and retention.  And he has the pull to make things happen.

Michael,

I am an analyst in Paul Mead's Continental Power Trading group in London. I=
=20
am currently working on the project, which requires the use of EMSS, and=20
experience some difficulties interpreting the output results. Steven Leppar=
d=20
from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and=
=20
consequently the person to contact in case of problems.

I have been running simulations for the Dutch market and was asked to provi=
de=20
the traders with some front-end screen graphs in order to interpret the=20
numerical results. One of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack=
=20
and system's marginal cost, as we only run cost based scenarios. To sort ea=
ch=20
station's hourly generation I need its marginal cost. To my knowledge thoug=
h,=20
marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit (TransArea=20
Marginal Units query, Marg_cost unit). Therefore I was sorting the stations=
=20
according to the cost which I calculated based on the outputs from Station=
=20
Detail by Hour query. The calculation was as follows:

For each hour, for each generating station:

"marginal cost" [o/MWh] =3D (Generation_Cost [o000] * 1000)/Generation [MWh=
] -=20
VOM_cost [o/MWh]

This I thought would include fuel cost and start up costs. However, a=20
marginal station which I get on the stack as a result of the above=20
calculation is not a station given in Marginal Station field in TransArea=
=20
Marginal Units query. I have also looked into TransArea_Data_Hr table and=
=20
TransArea_Data table but non of the costs there match my results.

Do you happen to know what formula is used to determine Marg_cost and which=
=20
outputs I should be using to obtain the right results?

It might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone. In this cas=
e=20
could you please send me your direct telephone number. I am struggling=20
understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much.

Tani - are you happy having Steve Leppard and Research reporting to you in 
London, with a thick dotted line to Vince in Houston.  Up to now it has 
reported to Dale, so it makes sense to shift to you.  Steve wants a dotted 
line to commercial, which I'm happy to have to me as he does o much work for 
us.

Hi Dale

Following discussions with Vince, Grant and Stinson, we've drawn up the 
proposed budget.  We're working on the basis that Research Group headcount 
will grow to 8 in the near future.

Business trips US: 8
Business trips Europe: 10

Computer software and licences: GBP 10,000
Office postage: GBP 350
Employee recruitment fees: GBP 30,000 ( = 3 x 20% x GBP 50,000)
Professional subscriptions and memberships AND books: GBP 15,000
Training courses: GBP 16,000 ( = 8 x GBP 2,000)
Conferences: GBP 8,000 ( = 4 x GBP 2,000)
Mobile phones: GBP 1,500 ( = 3 x GBP 500 = me + 2 floaters)
Hardware: GBP 10,000 ( = laptops, workstations)

Suggested allocation as follows...
RAC 20%
UK Power 20%
UK Gas 5%
Continental Power 20%
Continental Gas 5%
Global products 10%
EBS 10%
EES 10%
...unless you've got any other views on this one (I'm happy to take advice 
here).

Vince has said you can give him a call if you want to discuss any of these 
points further, but I'm happy to field initial queries (I'll have to get used 
to it!).

Cheers,
Steve

Hi Zimin,

INFLATION:
I am also spending a lot of time looking at short-term auto-regressive models 
for PPI and long-term, more fundamentally-based models.  This work is 
important because we have potentially a large positive P&L that may be 
unlocked by moving to our new indicative UK PPI curves.  John Sherriff and 
Trena are keen that any models I produce are vetted/approved in Houston, so I 
will forward to Stinson or yourself initially for review once ready and 
documented.

STORAGE:
Thanks for the current storage  model.  Due to the complexity of the 
modelling issues involved, I would strongly support a visit by you to help me 
meet the needs of the London customers in this matter, and am happy to act as 
the anchor for information flow in the mean time.

Regards,

Anjam

Anjam,

Thanks a lot.  After getting that book I will redo the US inflation model.  
Our exposure
to CPI inflation risk is huge (think about how many contracts signed by EES), 
so the
US model is very important.

The storage model is going through aduit by Prof. D. Duffie. We are adding 
features
to it.   I can send you the current version. Maybe it is worthwhile for me to 
go to London
to discuss with the users about the valuation.

Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates
at low cost and low risk. I would take this person in,
assuming you can still run it by the Analyst/Associate program. They closed 
the books
for the summer.

Let me know if you run into any roadblock. I shall try help you from here.

Do you have any views on taking summer interns here in the Research group in 
London?  One of our Analysts has recommended a friend of hers (resume 
attached).  I'm sure we could dream up some work for an intern, so let me 
know what you think.

Many thanks,

Vince - I agree with your conclusion here.  We are still trying to fill

how we announce Steve's lead research role relative to when we know who will 
take Dale's spot.  Perhaps we should just
move forward with the Steve announcement the day that Dale moves full time to 
EBS.  I will ask Richard Lewis to take the lead
in working with you on finalizing the decision and communcicating the changes 
to the organization.

But I do want to reinforce how pleased we are to have Steve here.  He is a

Subject: London Research Group

John,

I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.

As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.


My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.

His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
greatly improved.

Please, let me know what you think.

Vince

Dear Dale/all,

Thanks for the interest... I have already contacted intranet development 
about updates - they don't have to do much except publish the document and 
maybe add some headings, so IT resources are not really a problem.  As you 
suggest, what would be great is if we can get some more content in terms of 
well-explained introductions to various topics like value-at-risk, credit 
risk and so on.  It should not be at too high a level and will probably have 
to be written specifically for this purpose.  If you have time to put any 
interesting material together (Word docs, text files or Power point 
presentations), please do pass it on to me and I will collate for the update.

Regards,

Anjam

This would be a good opportunity to update the content on the intranet site

need IT to publish it out to the intranet.

Hi Dale (& Vince),

I have now gathered everyone's views and the consensus is that we should hire 
Sharad to work with me on front-office pricing and so we should proceed to 
the offer stage.  As you can see his salary is o43,500 currently and he 
appears to have a guaranteed bonus of o25,000 for next year.  He would join 
for >o50,000 from my discussions with Alex Blair, the consultant.  He is very 
interested in Enron, but is also talking to Morgan Stanley.  I discussed with 
Vince, who recommended that Sharad should come in at the same level (rank) as 
Kirstee Hewitt; I would also like to arrange for a direct reporting line to 
me for Sharad.

Regards,

Anjam

John Sherriff has suggested we all get together in the near future to discuss 
the demands being placed on the Research Group.  I will be making a request 
for additional resources, and the aim of the meeting is to determine the most 
appropriate size for the team.

Assistants:  Can we aim for week commencing 6th November?
Vince: Would you like to teleconference in?

Many thanks
Steve

Hi Navroz

Having presented my real options work at a recent conference, I think I can 
see my way clear to producing a much reduced version (3 or 4 pages) of my 
"Diagrammatic Real Options" paper.  Would Risk still be interested in such a 
shortened article?

Cheers,
Steve

Steven,
After further consultation with the Technical  Editor, we feel that your work 
would find a more suitable environment for  exposure in The Journal of Risk.
?
If you email a copy of your work (to the  Editor-in-Chief, Philippe Jorion) 
and outline what has happened to:
?
?pjorion@uci.edu
?
then I am sure that they will be keen to give due  consideration.
?
Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming  to this 
decision.
?
Best Wishes,
?
Navroz Patel,
Technical Assistant, Risk Magazine.

Hi Vince

Good luck calling Anjam.  He never seems to answer his mobile when Sharad 
calls him to track him down.  Furthermore he's off work until Tuesday.

I've had Tani ask me what's happened to the announcement about my new 
appointment.  Any progress there?

Cheers,

I am calling Anjam to give him a deadline regarding move to Houston.
If he decides to stay in Houston, you should meet with him to convey
the concerns regarding his performance.

Subject: Support for Exotica

All

Sharad's investigations of Exotica's status in London have turned up a very 
confused state of affairs. This isn't being helped by the fact that:
1. Anjam is rarely at his desk, and can't be found anywhere in the building.
2. When he is around he isn't willing or able to provide all the information 
Sharad might need to support Exotica.  
This is worrying since much of our business depends on the validity of 
Exotica's valuations.

Sharad will now request information from Anjam via email to leave a trail, 
and I want to alert you to the fact that Sharad will be cc'ing you in on 
these emails.  

If things don't improve soon, I may need to request some assistance in 
extracting this information from Anjam.

Many thanks,
Steve

Annette...

We just wanted to drop you a quick line to thank you for the invitation to 
the UK met presentation today!  Tony and I are currently trying to get a 
grasp of what the traders here require in the way of weather information and 
are building a support structure for them.  As such - we will need to have 
close ties with the UK Met office as well as other data providers.  The 
information presented today was very helpful.

We'd like to take a little time to sit down with you - and/or some of the 
other participants whose markets are weather driven.  We'd like to get a feel 
for what data is already streaming in - and then get an idea as to how we can 
utilize and supplement that data for the Europe markets.  We have a model 
created in Houston to start from - but we want to make sure to tailor to the 
needs of the traders here.

Would you like to take some time to sit down and chat?  Perhaps Tony and I 
can take you and some others out to lunch - or for an afternoon coffee?

Thanks for your help...

Dear Research and related group team members,

I will be visiting the Houston office from Monday 10th July and hope to have 
another very useful information exchange, including updating you all on the 
activities in the London office by means of a presentation.  For those of you 
who are unfamiliar with me, I have been looking after quantitative analysis 
for the European markets for the last 3+ years, in particular focusing on 
derivatives pricing and risk management techniques (e.g. load forecasting, 
inflation curve building, financial options on real power stations etc.) - 
look forward to meeting you all again soon.

Best regards,

Ben,

I spoke with Anjam and gave him the information about my trip.
Here is the short summary:

1. If you are free for dinner on  Sunday, I would be glad to meet with you 
(as well
as Anjam and Steve). I would like to review what's going on in Houston and 
London.

2. We can arrange the interviews for all  the candidates you lined up Monday 
afternoon
(Tuesday  and Wednesday mornings are the alternative dates). We treat the 
interviews as internal
to the Research Group  and we shall arrange full interview schedules at a 
later day for those candidates
who pass our internal test.

3. Please, feel free to put on my agenda other meetings you think might be 
useful.
Please, coordinate the meetings with Anjam and Steve. I am busy on Tuesday 
afternoon
(I a speak at a conference).

Vince

All

Following discussions between Matt, Vince Kaminski, and me, Matt has decided 
he'd like to make a longer-term commitment to Research.  With this in mind 
we'd like to request that Matt is switched from A&A to the Specialist track.  
Vince and I feel this is clearly in the best interests of Enron given Matt's 
proven strengths in quant analysis.

How do we proceed?

All the best,
Steve

Anjam has told me he is not going to an energy competitor (he mentioned 
weather derivatives as a the only overlap.  I therefore see this as low risk 
from a security point of view, so let's make sure handover is thorough.  You 
might focus our security efforts on his access to weather-related info.

Subject: Further actions on Anjam's departure

Hi Mel

Further to our earlier discussions here's the full list of actions we'd like 
to put into place regarding Anjam's departure:

HR-type stuff:
1. Get Anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible.  There is no need for 
him to remain on the floor.  This will need to be delayed until IT number 1 
is completed (cataloguing his work).
2. Determine where Anjam is heading.  We need to know who is going to know 
our positions and curves next.
3. Remove his security pass, and insist that he is always accompanied when in 
the building.  Sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work.

IT-type stuff:
1. Ask him to catalogue the contents of his h: drive, since the rest of the 
group will need to support his work in the future.  This should take no more 
than a day or two.
2. Get IT to obtain their backups of Anjam's h: drive for weekly intervals 
over the last two months.  This will allow us to determine what he has 
deleted.
3. Get IT to provide a snapshot of Anjam's Notes folders, and provide records 
of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months.  I'm worried 
about code/data he may have zipped up and mailed out.
4. Ask IT to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from 
Anjam's c: drives.  There may be useful info here too.
5. Revoke all internet access, whether via Explorer or Notes mail.
6. Get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months.

Vince has OK'd this lot, so let's do it ASAP.

Many thanks,
Steve

Hi Martina & Trena,

I think this is a reasonable smoothing method between the short and long-term 
models - let me know if you need me to explain it.  I also included the 
short-term models so this is now a self-standing spreadsheet, but probably 
still needs cleaning up a bit.

ZIMIN & STINSON:

We agreed on short-term and long-term models for DZCV and PLLU PPI indices in 
a meeting with Dale and Trena and a simple smoothing is employed to give the 
results as follows.  Blue and red curves are the proposed DZCV and PLLU PPI 
index forward curves whilst RPI is the market-derived black curve.

Dear all,

Attached is Anjam's reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model. 

The UK Inflation Book's main exposure is to two PPI indexes - the PLLU and 
the DZCV through year 2010. Both are PPI Output indexes with very comparable 
baskets. The only significant difference between the two is the presence of 
energy in the PLLU (7.6%). The model in use escalates the two indexes by the 
same factors. However, with the energy price fluctuations in recent years 
different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their 
drivers. Anjam concentrated on the PLLU index first and he will shortly 
construct one for the DZCV based on the same methodology, but without the 
Brent Crude curve. 

The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is 
significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is 
considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients. This will result in us 
having more confidence in our monthly P&L as well as less fluctuations. 

Best regards,

Martina

Subject: New Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book

Dear all,

I followed up on the suggestions of happening babe at the conference call as 
follows:-

1) USE LESS DATA

Unfortunately, kicking out only 1990 makes the overall equation a lot less 
robust, in fact dramatically so, and so eliminates the possibility of using 
less data.  The model tested was the RPI(month+15) & Deviations from 
long-term average for Brent Crude.  The r-squared and F-statistic collapsed 
by eliminating the first 12 months of data.

2) DEVIATIONS IN CRUDE VARIABLE

Shifting the crude explanatory variable backwards and forward by 3 and 6 
months did not alter the model goodness-of-fit parameters dramatically and so 
my suggestion is that we stick with the following model:

PLLU[t] = a.RPI[t] + b.RPI[t+15] + c.BrentCrudeDeviations[t] + Constant

3) TESTING MODEL WITH SINE WAVE

To gauge the response of the model to wildly-varying RPI forward curve, a 
sine wave of period 3 years for RPI was input into the PPI model.  The result 
was as expected; PPI pre-empts the moves in RPI by about 8 months.  The 
magnitude of the oscillations is also reduced.  This shows that if we had 
more detail in our RPI forward curve, then the PPI model would reflect those 
peaks and humps adequately.



CONCLUSION

I therefore propose that we use the model that incorporates RPI, RPI[t+15] 
and deviations of Brent Crude from long-term average.  The new model is 
plotted below in burgundy and can be compared to the old PPI which is 
depicted in blue. 


Please note that all this analysis only applies to PLLU, and that a separate 
study will be needed for the DZCV PPI index.

Regards,

Anjam

Subject: Update on PPI Model for Inflation Book

Dear all,

We thought it might be useful to incorporate Brent crude as an explanatory 
variable for PPI; it was found that deviations of Dated Brent Crude from the 
long-term average of $18.80 was the best form of the variable to use (for 
predictions the Brent forward curve produced by the Global Products Group is 
used).  The three new equations developed were:-

PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + c.(DatedBrentCrude - 18.8) + constant, 
where N is 14,15 or 16
[REDDISH CURVES]
r-squared approx 0.49
F-stat approx 32

The chart below shows what our projected PLLU curve would be given this 
equation, and also the three best relations from before which were based upon 
current and future RPI:

PLLU(t) = a.RPI(t) + b.RPI(t+N) + constant, where N is 14,15 or 16
[GREENISH CURVES]
r-squared approx 0.47
F-stat approx 45

COMPARISON OF MODELS
As you can see, the two equations differ in the very short-term and very 
long-term; the inclusion of deviations of Brent Crude leads to short-term 
predictions of 3.0% to 3.2% over the next six months.  The greenish curves 
predict PLLU in the range of 2.5% to 2.8% over the next six months.

The curves are then very similar until 2009, when the models including crude 
break-away to the upside, relative to the falling RPI curve.  The model based 
purely on RPI hugs the RPI curve much more closely in the longer term.  This 
is only important to the extent that we have large positions beyond 2009 
(which we don't).

SUGGESTION
What could be useful now is a differently-specified model designed to 
forecast only the next 3 months, using auto-regressive or auto-regressive 
error terms.  This model would be far more accurate in the near-term, and we 
could include this information onto the front of this long-term model.  This 
may be useful, despite the fact that most of our exposure is in future time 
buckets.



BACK-TESTING

All the models give similar visual and statistical performance over the data 
sample used (based mainly on 1990s "new paradigm" economy).



Hopefully we can discuss these and other points later in the tele-conference; 
your ideas on this would be appreciated.

Regards,

Anjam

Hi Kate,

Firstly it was very useful to hold the informal discussion with him.  Sharad 
seemed hesitant due to the offer not being what he expected.  He asked me 
some questions about the "bonus culture" at Enron and suggested that it was 
not as good as at investment banks that he is interviewing with.  I sold him 
on the value he can extract from the excellence within the Research Group and 
the ability to join a growing organisation at a critical point in, but he 
still seemed reticent saying that he "needs time" which I understood to mean 
that he was looking for a better offer elsewhere.  He is a great candidate 
and it would be a real shame to lose him, given the difficulty of getting 
good candidates.

I discussed this with Vince and given how much we need him in Research in 
London and Vince agreed to discuss the possibility of an element of guarantee 
or sign on to help him make the right decision.

I think Vince will call you or Dale to discuss this.

Regards,

Anjam

Nick,

We may have problems getting the VC location in Houston on  short notice.
We are currently on stand-by. We shall default, if we have no other choice,
to a phone interview.

Steve,

I can pick up the cost of your trip from the Research Group budget.

The more I think about  it, the more I am convinced it would be difficult 
to justify 2 trips per person. I think that we should go for one contiguous 
stay per person and make a good
effort to make these trips productive.

Vince

Thanks for offering to look my presentation over.  The deadline for 
submission has been extended until tomorrow (Friday), so there's less of a 
hurry.

As regard our summer visits, we'll need to speak to Dale over the budget.  
Personal commitments mean it's difficult for me to take two whole months to 
visit, so if the cost is prohibitive I may need to make just one shorter 
visit.  I'd obviously like to spend longer, and two visits seems to be the 
only way I can do it.  I believe the situation is similar for Kirstee.

I've persuaded Richard to pay for Matt's visit in its entirety, and I've no 
doubt that RAC/Credit Trading will pick up the bills for Ben and Kirstee.  
It's difficult to think who'd be the natural group to pay for me.  I honestly 
think I'll have difficulty persuading, e.g. Richard, that it's worth his 
while to pay for my visit.  I get the impression he thinks I'm doing OK 
without the need to go to Houston for further training.

I'm interviewing a candidate for Bjorn's model review role during today's 
videoconference, so we'll need to speak beforehand or perhaps Friday.

All the best,
Steve

I shall get back to you with my comments on Thursday morning.

I also want to talk to you tomorrow about finalizing the dates of the summer

Ben and I have been discussing the possibility of getting more dedicated 
support from Houston on our project.  We are wondering what the possibility 
is of having either Amitava or Vasant come over for 8 - 12 weeks to help get 
things jumpstarted on the the credit scoring and modeling front as well as 
provide some guidance on the CLO part of the business and potentially hiring 
an additional  full time resource.  If there is any possibility, it would be 
hugely valuable given the long lead times to get someone from the City in and 
integrated in addition to the significant cost.

Let me know your thoughts

Dear All,

I have been asked to give a talk on the use of copulas in stress testing
at a Risk conference. 
As I don't really work directly on those sorts of things anymore I would need 
some help
putting anything together- I am happy with the theory, I would just need to 
present some results. It is a risk conference in London/New York in February.

If I can't accept it soonish I'll have to turn it down. 
The organiser has another person in mind and I don't want to give a rubbish 
talk. 

Regards,
Sharad Agnihotri

Dear Sharad,

I attach a copy of the draft programme - please feel free to suggest any
amendments.

To give you some context, we're pitching the course at  more senior risk
managers who are familiar with standard stress testing  techniques so the
content must be a significant step further e.g. alternative  approaches,
incorporating credit risk etc.

My number is at the bottom of this message. Thanks for your help,

Hi,


 This email is in reference to our plan for detailed discussions about Enron 
Credit's modeling strategy.  Several meetings have already been scheduled.  
Please refer to the attached Excel spreadsheet for further details.


 Also, if you like, we can have more informal discussions over lunch, dinner, 
drinks, etc.

 Thanks in advance for your time.

I shall talk to Anjam about it. Our impression here in Houston is that Thomas 
is quite qualified 
and we are very interested in him. A few days will not make much difference 
in the hiring process.

Subject: Thomas Knudsen

Dale, Vince

As you all know I have attempted to get Thomas Knudsen interviewed as a 
result of Prof Lane Hughston's recommendation (Lane is an acquaintance of 
Vince and me, and is a very senior figure in the world of quant finance).  
Anjam vetoed the idea of interviewing Thomas since he was "too old and too 
experienced".  Since I felt that Thomas has some merit, I asked Houston to 
have an informal chat with Thomas.  Houston wish to pursue the interview 
process further, and Anjam has set about setting up the interviews.  I'm 
somewhat concerned about the way in which Anjam is going about this, since it 
seems he's trying to put up barriers to these interviews.

I received a concerned email from Thomas Knudsen this morning in which he 
recounts some strange conversations with Anjam.  He says he received a call 
from Anjam on Thursday (13th April) evening (outside office hours), asking 
how he got his CV into Enron (I'd shown Anjam the email and CV back in early 
February), and how Anjam could contact him (despite the fact he was 
contacting him at that moment).

Anjam then called Thomas on his work number (bad form) on Friday 14th asking 
Thomas to come in for interviews on Monday (one working day's notice).  
Thomas told Anjam he was going on holiday on Wednesday of this week, and that 
he'd have to see if he could make time given the need to tidy up some things 
at work.  He said he'd contact Anjam on Monday (today) to confirm his 
availability.

Today (17th April) Thomas called Anjam to say he couldn't make it, and that 
he wouldn't be able to make it for two weeks (not so serious, he thought, 
given that we're losing time to Easter anyway).  Anjam told Thomas that the 
position might be filled in two weeks' time.

Thomas is concerned about missing the boat, and I for one didn't even realise 
it was leaving so soon!

Can anyone shed any light on this?

Steve

Hi Anita,

 How are you?  I arrived yesterday late morning from the London Gatwick 
airport.  Due to rush hour traffic, etc. it took a while to get into the city 
to the hotel.

 Also, due to May Day (May 1st) protests/riots, etc., the hotel management 
strongly recommended that we remain in the hotel.  

 However, I am in the office today.  I can be reached via email or via 
telephone at 44 (0) 207 783 5647.

Take care,
Iris

Vince - appreciate you taking the time to dicuss some of our ongoing 
quantitative challenges.  Just wanted to confirm with you the next steps we 
agreed to:

research to develop a working prototype of a private firm model by Aug. 2001
this effort will include evaluating existing private firm models
houston research to allocate a full time resource, who is willing to spend a 
significant amount of time in London (at least initially) to kick off the 
effort

Please let me know if I have missed something.

Anjam,

This would be a good opportunity to update the content on the intranet site 
and expand the coverage into new areas.  Can you arrange some IT resources 
for us?  If everyone in Research works on developing the content, we just 
need IT to publish it out to the intranet.

Thoughts??

Anjam, congratulations on your initiative. I appreciate that you share this 
information throughout Enron.
As you may know, my group is working with Joe's business units to create 
so-called market hubs.
I see great potential in sharing some of the information that you have 
acucmulated and that is not proprietary to Enron.
I would appreciate if we could sit down tomorrow and talk about the 
possibility to leverage on the existing know-how.
Regards
Sven

Hi Wendy:

We have finally made arrangements for Vince's trip in September.  He will
be arriving in London Monday the 18th at 9:55 AM.

He would like to set up a meeting with Paul and Julian sometime on Tuesday,
the 19th.   Just let me know when it is convenient.

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley

I would be grateful if you could give me some dates and times when Vince will 
be
free to meet with Paul Day and Julian Leake, Tom Leuthwaite is not available 
to
meet unfortunately during the week that Vince is here.

Hi Vince,

Having discussed with Sharad, we think it would make sense for Sharad to go 
to Houston for a few weeks starting at the end of October.  This would 
overlap with Ben's visit in November and so some alternative arrangement 
would have to be made for accommodation.  If he goes after Ben then there 
will not be much time before the holidays meaning it would be left until 
early next year.  Please let us know if these dates work for you, and if so 
then we can talk about accommodation arrangements thereafter.

OUT: Sat 21st October
RETURN: Saturday 16th December

Regards,

Anjam

Subject: Re: Confidential  

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
bonus or incremental bonus?

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.

Hi Guys,

I thought I would quickly update you on a few meetings we've had with the ag 
folks here over the past 2 days.  They are extremely interested in weather 
support and appear to be our most enthusiastic customer group to date.  A 
summary:

1) They are interested in Cocoa, Coffee and Sugar.  Specifically:
 Brazil:  Londrina, Bauru, Lavras   (All WMOs available in Accuweather)
 Vietnam:  Kentum, Dalat (No data immediately evident)
 Ivory Coast:  Man, Gagnoa (WMOs in Accuwx)
 Indonesia:  Sumatra-Kotubumi, Sulawesi-Dolo (No data immediately evident)

2) They are specifically interested in event spikes - extreme temperature, 
precipitation or wind.  They are also interested in any trend information we 
can devise.  Links between ENSO or other large scale oscillations that could 
have long range effects.  Tony has already given their group a 101 course on 
ENSO and its impacts on these areas.

3) They would eventually like daily AM briefings - along with a daily product 
related to their market (ie precip/temp graphs etc)

4) They do not begin actually trading for another 6 to 8 weeks - so we have 
some time to experiment with the type of support that fits them best.

Tony and I agree that we would like to brainstorm this a bit with you guys to 
see what exactly can be produced daily - as efficiently as possible.  We 
should be able to add any lat/long points we want to the list of 
international cities streaming through from the MRF/AVN/ECMWF from EarthSat.  
The problems here would be the models' problems handling tropical weather 
along with specific local effects - especially in Indonesia.

Let's talk about this at some point and get our thoughts together.

Steve

Following our discussion please close down all intranet access to the London 
Research Group site.  Inaccuracies have been found in the content which may 
have implications for our trading operations.  Closing the site will force 
traders to contact our Group direct, ensuring only correct information is 
passed.

The site will be completely overhauled over the coming months, so I see 
little benefit in reinstating access to the site in the near future.

Many thanks,
Steve

Subject: UK Swap RPI Model

Hi Zimin!

Please find attached the RPI model I developed by bootstrapping RPI swaps. 
The structure of this particular swap is:  

semi/semi Act/365F
>
> YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2
> p = payment month
>
The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000. You will 
notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as 
opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot).

Please find below a graphic comparison between the RPI curve produced by 
swaps and the one produced by the GILT market.



Looking forward to your comments.

Best regards,

Martina

Anita,

Two weeks I mentioned was just to indicate an approximate duration of the 
stay.
I would leave the final decision to Iris, in coordination with Vasant and 
Amitava, based
on the business need.

One week, with the possibility of extension if necessary is fine.

Hi Vince,

This candidate was forwarded from the Norway office.  He is finishing his PhD 
in Cambridge but is available soon.  If you are free on Thursday before the 
regular weekly meeting that would be good - would 3pm or 4pm work for you 
(9am or 10am your time) to set up the video interview?

I do not think minor changes would allow you to just use the same file.  You 
will have to check with Risk.  This is Risk Books, a specialist division of 
Risk Publications in London.  Address: Haymarket House, 28-29 Haymarket, 
London SW1Y 4RX.

The publication was in a book, entitled "Credit Derivatives: Applications for 
Risk Management, Investment and Portfolio Optimisation," publishd in 1998.  I 
am not sure if a lawyer was involved, maybe Vince will know.

Subject: Credit Article

Hello Vasant!

Bijoya has updated me on the discussion you have been having on the article 
from Risk Magazine about Credit.

We have found that the attachments you sent her are actually not 
word-for-word the same as the published version we have - the changes are 
only minor, wever, and have not altered the article in any way.

My question now concerns the copyrights. Since the version you sent is 
slightly different, do you think this gives us the freedom to publish it 
without the consent of Risk?

And if not - can you tell me if it was published by Risk UK or Risk in the 
States? And which issue was it? I just want to have all of the details if I 
need to call someone at the magazine ... 

Also - was there a lawyer involved in the publication procedure, or was this 
handled by London/Houston PR? Or by Vince himself?

Sorry about all of the questions ... I just want to avoid problems well in 
advance.

Thank you!


Regards,

Katja

Dear all,

I just got a call from Thomas who wants to cancel the interviews scheduled 
for today - he told me that he would call me at the beginning of May (after 
his holidays) to arrange them.  I did mention that there was a risk that the 
position may be filled by then, but he seemed unperturbed by this.

Dale, Richard,

I am ready to cover the cost of Steve's trip to Houston (one month in the 
summer).
I think very highly of Steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his
horizons. I see him as a very valuable asset of Enron and a great leader
in not too distant future. He needs exposure to more diverse business
problems and areas of research. I think it will be in the best interest of 
the company
to devote some resources to foster his development.



Vince

All

John Sherriff has suggested we all get together in the near future to discuss 
the demands being placed on the Research Group.  I will be making a request 
for additional resources, and the aim of the meeting is to determine the most 
appropriate size for the team.

Assistants:  Can we aim for week commencing 6th November?
Vince: Would you like to teleconference in?

Many thanks
Steve

Subject: Re: Confidential  

Both,

Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.

Based on your comments here would be my proposal

o63,500 basic salary - 
o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  

Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  

Let me know your thoughts.

Here's Vince's comments on your proposal for Steve.  Also, what's a 2-Yr 
Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
bonus or incremental bonus?

Dale,

Thanks for your message.
I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.

I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
correctly). Steve has a much higher value
to Enron than Anjam.
