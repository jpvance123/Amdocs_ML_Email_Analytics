Louise,

The lawyers are turning docs and expect to have the escrow account set up and funded by the end of the week (19th to set up and 20th to fund).  Delta told us they will fund this week.  I was speaking with Dean Vanech on a separate deal and he matter-of-factly said that he thought that we were done on the turbines, just wrapping up the paperwork.  I will let you know if (i) anything changes or (ii) the $ shows up.

Regards,

Chris

Amy,

Louise is back from maternity leave and I think will want to get back up to speed with where we are in Portland regarding these contracts. When you get Tim to finalise his "plan" I suggest we discuss with Louise and then decide how best to proceed.

She tendered her resignation this morning.  Intends to sit out for noncompete period.  Don't think that she has secured a new job yet, but will likely show up with Calpine or AEP in Portland sometime in Q4.  Probably has a verbal commitment from Wolfe to work with him wherever he lands.  Haven't had exit interview yet.  Most likely leaving due to money.  Hate to lose her, but Foster and Swerzbin are ok with it.

I will call Wolfe today and tell him about Holli and directly ask him if he is leaving based on this new information.

No action needed by either of you.  You can ignore this if you like.  The i=
ssue is really complicated and I've tried to summarize it.  I'm not sure ho=
w closely the two of you have been tracking activities at FERC.  We had an =
interim victory late last week on the chargeback issue. =20

As Edison and Pacific Gas were defaulting on PX and ISO payments in January=
 and February, the PX attempted to invoke the charge back section of its ta=
riff.  This had several strange outcomes.  First, the PX attempted to recov=
er the short payments by Edison for December activity by charging PX market=
 participants based on a three month rolling average of gross sales.  If th=
e PX owed a supplier money, they simply short-payed by the prorata amount. =
 If the market participant owed the PX money, the PX added it to the partic=
ipants bill.  This created a series of short pays and chargebacks.  If a ma=
rket participant who received a chargeback bill didn't pay (e.g., PG&E for =
SCE's December PX activity), the PX would then allocate that amount (via sh=
ort pays and chargebacks) to other participants.  This iterative process wo=
uld continue until credit-worthy participants shouldered the burden.  The P=
X attempted to us an equally bizarre method to allocate defaults by the uti=
lities on their ISO RT energy bill (the PX is the Schedule Coordinator for =
the utilities and handles payments to the ISO for RT energy on behalf of th=
e utilities).  Rather than shortpaying suppliers to the ISO for defaults by=
 the utilities on RT energy charges, the PX attempted to collect this money=
 from its participants in order to pay the ISO -- that is sellers into the =
PX Day Ahead market were supposed to pay SCE's and PG&E's RT ISO bill.  Thi=
s was done via a chargeback.  This led to our "last man standing" theory, w=
hereby the PX would iteritively chargebacks until a few credit-worthy entit=
ies were stuck with PG&E and SCE's defaults in both the PX and ISO markets.

FERC granted market participants some relief on Friday.  They directed the =
PX to (1) rescind all chargebacks and (2) refrain from taking any future ch=
argebacks.  They found "the chargeback provision in the PX tariff was not d=
esigned to address default of this magnitude and, thus, its application in =
these circumstances is unjust and unreasonable."  This is not the last word=
 on this matter.  There are a variety of state court cases that impact this=
, and, of course the bankruptcy judge will weigh in as well.  However, this=
 is a solid victory for us as FERC has sided with us rather than the PX wit=
h respect to interpreting the PX tariff for defaults.

Not done - but good progress:

We reached agreement with the water bank late last night on the definitive agreement.  The members of the bank are going to their respective boards today and tomorrow and are saying that they are prepared to sign tomorrow.  They have flaked on us in the past, so there is still a decent chance we dont get done soon, but in general we are pleased that they moved so quickly during the past week.

Calpine started being difficult yesterday re the timing of closing, water (they now want the Azurix agreement with a guarantee) and taking the gas transport.  We played hardball - told them Azurix is out and that we dont need the transport.  The outcome of that position is that we will not assign our transport to them and we will opt out of our transport precedent agreement.  Calpine indicated that they have their own transport and if we dont close, they would assign us 50MMCF/Day.  I am not sure if this is their final answer but it is clearly better than them having a put back to us for 100MMCF/Day.

I suspect this will change - some for the bettter, some for the worse, but I will keep you posted.

Chris

Louise,
 
We got comments back from Allegheny.  We are in general agreement - this will require some tweaking over the weekend.  Conf call scheduled for Saturday.  Dan Gordon just commented that "looks like we are getting done".  
 
Plan: Sign Monday which gives us the five business days to pull it together.
 
Crisis averted for now.
 
Have a good weekend.  Talk with you Monday.
 
Regards,
 
Chris

Louise,

Looks like the $ wont show until Wednesday, then we give notice to Turbopark, wait five business days, transfer the turbines and get the $ from the escrow account.  Jake spoke directly with Hancock - they said they are done, but we have 24 hours for the escrow approval, then Hancock has a 24 hour notice period to release the funds ...hence Wednesday.

- No significant change in margin or hotlist summary

Las Vegas:  Allegheny, Black Hills, Northland Power are on dealbench reviewing data, info memo and purchase and sale agreement.  
Process: review docs and data, visit site, negotiate purchase and sale - still on track for June 30 signing and August 31 funding.

Roseville: Exercised option for $6MM of ERC's from Georgia Pacific.  Working on development agreement and initial CEC application.

AMPS: Last week received complete emissions data on units.  Pursuing deals to install, sell or lease first 2 units.  Most likely structure: Site owner contributes site and pays 20% of costs and get 20% of margin associated with selling energy into merchant market.  Currently in discussion with 6 industrials and 8 utilities.  Oregon Steel is in the lead - they are spending $ on permitting and engineering at their site in Portland (unfortunately the site is near my house so I may protest!).

Blue Dog: $3.5MM of income recognition for turbine sale has moved to Q2 from Q3.

Tolls to Generators: Reliant did not lift our 100MW Mid-C offer. but they are still working on it - they had VAR constraints.  We are also showing synthetic tolls to other generators that expressed interest in our LV toll:  Duke, Constellation, Cinergy, NRG, Dynegy and Allegheny.  While these companies lead with assets, they also have trading functions that seem willing to get long through a PPA.

DWR: Still working through credit and financial info.  Their bid is still there and in the money, but has fallen $2-$3/MWh due to the falling prices in the west.

Louise,

California is proposing to buy QF energy/capacity for $79 for 5 years or $69 for ten years.  We will re-run the economics of Ace today.

Guys,

This looks real positive for a QF resolution.  Do we know the proposed pricing terms and the impact on the Ace valuation?  Any news from Ahlstrom?

Good morning,
Here are the recent developments in the California power crisis:
-Yesterday, Governor Davis gave a press conference to announce a QF agreement that would ensure future utility payments and possibly deter involuntary bankruptcy filings by certain QFs. A CPUC order on long-term QF contracts is expected next Tuesday.
-Corroborating the governor's announcement, Edison International and PG&E Corp each announced yesterday that it reached agreement with the QFs for payment of future deliveries.
-The governor laid out a schedule that targets a final resolution to the utilities' final crisis by mid-April. On April 3, the CPUC is expected to issue an order on DWR cost recovery. A final settlement for the utilities is anticipated 10-15 days afterwards.
-Significantly, the governor expects that (1) the final settlement will occur within the existing rate structure, and (2) that the DWR will recover its costs with priority over the QFs and utilities.
-The achievement of a QF agreement may make potential bankruptcy appear more remote and therefore support the stocks in the near-term. However, we believe that substantially more effort will be required to resolve the utilities' financial crisis. We recommend that investors avoid EIX ($12.04, Hold) and PCG ($11.40, Hold), unless they have a high tolerance for risk and volatility.

Please call us with any questions you may have.

Attached is a simple power origination case study that I have developed for use at MBA functions as an alternative to a generic one-hour presentation about Enron.  It will be used for the first time at Georgetown tomorrow.  I thought this tool, or a derivative thereof, could also be useful in early identification of potential "Origination Track" Associates from the Associate pool, as it covers issues related to project development, risk analysis, financial evaluation and debt financing.

I would be happy to think together with you on changes to the case that would enhance its value to the Origination Track program.

FYI - we proposed several alternatives to DWR that would effectively extend our put swaption through the end of April for a cost to ENA of approximately $5MM.  None of those were acceptable to DWR.  The option will therefore expire at 5:00 PPT today.  Vikram Budraja, Advisor to Gov Davis, suggested that we are not dealing in good faith and suggested that he will speak with Ken Lay (we have heard this several dozen times).  In any event, I expect to talk with DWR tomorrow to propose  a short-term transaction.  They might accept it, reject it or prefer one of the term option proposals.

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

My only comment is that the project is referred to Pastoria Energy Facility and Pastoria Energy Center.  The name of the LLC is Pastoria Energy Facility LLC.  Calpine's wholly-owned sub, Pasotia Energy Center LLC, will be purchasing 100% of ENA's membership interest in Pastoria Energy Facility.

Louise,

A couple of weeks ago we bought an option on four more LM6000's for a Jan02 delivery.  The intent was to sell our 4 July01 machines and recognize approximately $5MM for this "time swap".  We believe that we are in a position to execute this swap (Delta Power is at the table), but during the past two weeks we have received very strong tolling bids (Merrill Lynch, Duke, Constellation) for the LV project that imply a $20MM value to the project but require a commercial operation date of Sep02.  COD of Sep02 requires early turbine delivery.  We are therefore leaning towards canceling the turbine sale/repurchase in order to go for the bigger prize.  It will require finalizing development, EPC contract, tolling agreement, finance plan and internal approvals by May 1.  I am recommending that we go for it.  If we are not able to pull it off, I am confident that the high bids for these machines will still be there.  

Chris

California Power Authority ("CPA") held its first meeting with developers last week.  We attended and presented ourselves as a potential developer and seller of turbines to either the CPA or CPA developers.   CPA has issued a form of non-binding LOI for interested developers to sign.  It needs to be signed in the next 24 hours (!) in order to stay in the CPA program.   I would like to do that (subject to legal edits) so that we can stay at the table.  

I bring this to your attention because it may be press-released that we have reached agreement with CPA and that we are offering to build a project for the CPA. 

Please let me know if you have any issues with this.

Regards,

Louise,

I think the following is appropriate and I can get done:

Dyer:
Base - Same
Cash - $50
Equity - $150

Mcdonald:
Base - Same
Cash - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet:
Base - Same
Cash - $100
Equity - $250

I know these are at the top end.  For what it is worth, the other guys I got done this year were not at the top end because I did not believe it was necessary (Gilbert, Page, Etringer, Thome, Wehn).

If we can say done, the actual contract process can be slowed so that the equity is not set till the November meeting.  Also, if we get done, I wont bug you anymore!

Louise,

Although nothing is going particularly well, here is what West Power Orig is focused on:

1. Sell Turbines
2. Sell Longview/Equipment
3. Close Sale of Saguaro
4. Sell San Joaguin ERC's - no bid for all; several smaller bids
5. Close Muni Commodity Deals - LODI, WAPA
6. Procure Retail Supply - RFP to 10 Generators
7. Assist Mid-Market w/ Coverage - playing catchup
8. Transmission - San Fran and other 
9  Joint Development Agreement - Roseville

I am obviously at your service to help on anything else.

Regards,

Chris Calger

Power Curve 5: Forward Power Continues Softening; Implications

*	The Power Curve has softened since our last analysis (Power Curve 4,
May 2).  Forward expectations are down 11%, 15% and 9% for 2001, 2002 and
2003, respectively.  The Spark Spread, an important measure of profit
potential, has declined further: down 18%, 32% and 84%, respectively.
*	Shape of curve remains "backwardated" - decreasing from a peak this
summer.
*	Softening trend has continued since January.  This period every
region was affected with California and the West showing the largest
declines.
*	Power Producers: most favorable commodity pricing environment this
summer--continue to expect positive earnings surprises 2Q and perhaps 3Q.
*	Recommendation to investors:  Expect near-term strength in Producers
keyed off of strong 2Q expectations.  Recommend shifting portfolio toward
Energy Merchants as we move into the summer.  Maintain positive ratings on
both groups of stocks given strong near-term earnings visibility.

I gave all the signed contract approvals to Kim Melodick as David is out.  I have signed them all but David hasn't.  I have kept all the original numbers as submitted by Chris and expect David to sign on this basis (ie original Chris numbers not David's changes).

Please sort out drafting for Chris.

I am comfortable with the Allegheny credit - my understanding is that they are getting a sweetheart deal on the assets being transferred from their regulated utility so they will be in a buying mode for quite some time - in fact they are a good candidate for buying this but I did not want to disrupt the negotiations by bringing up the equity sale.  

Regarding Turbopark, this project on its own could go into Turbopark (we are using their form of EPC), but because this is linked to a Fair Market Value QF, accounting is not comfortable using it (it risks our favourable Arthur Anderson treatment on all of our FMV assets)   We have assumed in our economics that the bridge loan is priced at 15%.   

The Allegheny toll, and all development contracts are a CP to this deal - this needs to be perfectly nailed down prior to pulling the trigger!

If you catch this before you go - are we happy with the Allegheny credit?    I take it that you just don't meet the terms of  Turbopark - what is the cost of the bridge loan? I assume Allengheny toll is a CP on going forward with this deal.

Turbine Swap:  We are providing the final definitive agreement to Delta today.  We have received and incorporated their comments.  Based on this, they are supposed to fund on April 20.  The lawyers are planning to meet early next week to review any final/new comments and closing process.  I am talking with Dean Vanech on a different matter so I will nudge him along as well.

I am out tomorrow - skiing

Las Vegas:  The development of the expansion is being pulled together and the tolling agreement with Allegheny is nearly complete.  We expect everything to be done later this month.  We would like approval to construct this project subject to everything being fialized.  As such, we are hoping to review this with you and John Monday, execute a DASH later in the week and seek Executive Committee/Board approval on April 30/May 1 for up to $200MM.  We will have a detailed presentation/DASH for your review Monday (RAC, finance, accounting and legal have seen the DASH and are aware of timing).  In general...

- Location:  North Las Vegas, adjacent to existing LM6000 QF facility
- Description: $195MM, 225MW combined cycle LM6000, 7,800 heat rate, COD of September 1, 2002
- Interconnect: Nevada Power
- Gas Supply: Southwest Power
- Permits: Done
- EPC Contractor: Modern Continental with Fixed Price turnkey with A-Rated bonding (a second tier, but financeable contract)
- Tolling terms: 15 year, Allegheny delivers fuel to plant, and takes power from plant, $12.15/kwmonth plus variable charges = $29MM / year
- Returns are > 15% when we believe the asset market needs 10%-12%
- Based on Fountain Valley comparables (discount rates and terminal value assumptions) I think we can make $25MM - $30MM selling this project this year.
- Interested bidders include Black Hills, Northland Power, TransCanada, Delta Power, Calpine
- Turbopark can not be used so Joe and I have agreed to a 120 day bridge loan from Enron until project financing can be secured 

Wind:  My Wind guys are talking with ENE Wind.  They are concerned that ENE Wind may sell to a BPA RFP at a price below EPMI's bid.  They also want to option a couple of ENE Wind's sites in order to quickly capture opportunities - in general we believe that ENE Wind has some good sites, but does not have the resources to get them done, so we would like to control the site and bring together companies that want to partner with us (Equity-Cinergy, EPC/O&M-Enexco).  We believe that we can pull a deal together that could result in ENE Wind selling more turbines and ENA generating strong marketing premiums without either one of us putting any significant capital at risk.   Mark Metz suggested that anything that can help ENE Wid sell more turbines is a good thing.  I will talk with him and Adam Umanoff.

Louise,

A third party developer wants to pay us a small fee ($75K - $100K) for the right to use EOL.  They own LM6000's and want to buy puts.  Understandably we offered them a very high premium and a very low strike so they instead want to pay us for the distribtion channel.   Even though they may be competing with our turbine position, I think we should do it subject to legal.   Steve Thome is talking with Brad Richter about it.

Please let me know if you disagree.

Regards,

 Louise,

Summary and Notes:

Roseville:
Pollutant:	Tons:		$/T		Cost
NOX		51		$21.5		$1.1MM
VOC		187		$27.5		$5.2MM
SOX		56		$6		$0.3MM
PM10		362		$29		$10.6MM		
Options:					$0.5MM
Total:						$17.7MM
	
San Joaquin:	
Pollutant:	Tons:		$/T		Cost	
NOX		326		$21		$6.9MM
VOC		22		$7.5		$0.2MM
SOX		36		$6		$0.2MM
Total:						$7.3MM

Bay Area:
Pollutant:	Tons:		$/T		Cost
Various		46		$11		$0.5MM


Total:						$25.5MM


- San Joaquin could be sold for a $3MM - $6MM gain; we are proceeding with Calpine, Cantor and Enron desk.
- Sale of Roseville and Bay Area ERC's would result in a significant discount (40%-50%) because the air districts would be upset - basically, they could apply a transfer discount to the credits of 15%-25% and also could make future transfers conditional upon their approval (increasing risk for buyer).  
- Sale would also cause collateral damage to any future ERC activities (Enron would be seen as speculator/carpetbagger)

Recommendation:
Pursue sale of San Joaquin credits and put the balance in the global finance funding vehicle.  Initial indication is that transfer of credits for finance purposes is easy for an air district to accept.  I am setting up a call to discuss with finance, legal and Kelly Brodbeck.

Transcripts of Lay's and Skilling's interviews are available as well.  PBS didn't have this scheduled on its program listing for Houston last night, but from what I hear, everyone on the interview panel was grilled on the show (Skilling takes on a fairly aggressive stance).

Hope both of you and Scott are all doing well.

Affectionate thoughts,

Mike,

This is an old problem, but Louise would like to discuss to ensure your communication approach today is more consistent with our visions and values.  Lets discuss.

Subject:	Re: Approval procedure for Pending Products   

 We are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products, the scheduled process will therefore re-create these products every day automatically (essentially just a change to the description).  Therefore the product will already be there.   In the mean time, all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue - we currently have most desks creating products weeks/months in advance.  This software change is scheduled for Friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month (February).

We have only 2 logged/taped phone calls to the HelpDesk when Portland office has called the HelpDesk  with regard to this issue. Clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap, but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo.  Dale does come in early specifically for any products Portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times (bad traffic) when he may be late.

14/1 	07:35 (CST) J Richter  called to approve products
	Products activated products within 2 minutes.

24/1 	07:34 (CST) J Richter called  to approve products
	07:45 (CST) Anna Gardiner approved products
	07:46 (CST) J Richter called to inquire on status
	07:48 (CST) HelpDesk rang J Richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems
	
Clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but EnronOnline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone.  We only seem to have 2 times that  the procedure has been used to the HelpDesk extent and not failed dramatically.

Changing the procedure for two days (assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods) when we are all working  to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems.  If we do not introduce this software change on Friday we should review this policy - I obviously have no problem with Tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway.

Subject:	Approval procedure for Pending Products

I would like to talk  with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products.  IT IS NOT WORKING!  The current procedure is for us to create the product and call Dale Neuner and let him know its out there.  If Dale is not in the office, or it is before or after normal work hours, the traders need to call the help desk, who in turn calls Amita in the London office who then approves the product.   The Portland office starts trading at 5:00 AM PPT.  In the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning.  This morning the traders had several daily products pending approval.  It took 45 minutes to get those products approved.  On daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour.  As a result, the trader missed most of the trading period.  OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY AND NEITHER ARE THE TRADERS.  

A solution was proposed in December, which I have attached below, to address this issue.  However, it only works in the ideal world.  It would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time.  That is not the reality.  By rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade.

I would like to propose an alternate solution.  We need a direct method for Tim Belden to have approval rights to approve existing products.  These are not new products, we trade them every day.  There is no reason Tim should not have a level of approval to, at the very least approve existing products.  Especially where the only change is the term.

Please call Tim Belden at 503-464-3820 or myself at 503-464-3836.  Look forward to hearing from you.  

Regards,
Mike Etringer

Subject:	Call Center - IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ!!! Product Activation for Portland Power


Enron's Portland Office is a few hours ahead of Houston.  There are times where Portland needs products approved and the Houston Product Control Group is not available.  As it is important that products get approved as soon as possible, a new process has been put in place .   

1.	PORTLAND Trader calls for Product Approval.
2.	Advise Dale Neuner asap (x3-9746).
3.	If Dale is not physically able to take call, please call Amita Gosalia (x830-3-6888).
4.	Should Amita not be available, please advise PCG member that Portland
	need a product(s) approved.
5.	PCG member will find Amita, and get product approved asap.

Note:  Please be sure to assign the Remedy ticket to the appropriate group.

If you have any questions regarding this new procedure, please advise!

Thanks,

Subject:	Product Activation for Portland Power

Mike -

Regarding our conversation re: support of Power trading, we propose the following:

1) Suggest to trading that they create all DRAFT products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day. I will always check for DRAFT products at the end of my day and Activate any that are in DRAFT. Just  FYI, Gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days (or weeks) in advance. I keep track of those and keep their products current in advance. It works very well.

2) I am usually at my desk no later than 7:30 a.m. each day. If trading creates a DRAFT product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the Call Center at 3-4357 and state the following:

THIS IS PORTLAND POWER TRADING AND I NEED A PRODUCT ACTIVATED ASAP. PLEASE CONTACT AMITA GOSALIA IN LONDON.

The Call Center will then contact Amita, who has the authority and responsibility for activating products. Amita has agreed to perform this function for Portland Power and will instruct her people at PCG-London to locate her immediately (in the event that she is away from her desk) when this message comes in from the Call Center.

Donna Greif in the Call Center has been appraised of this procedure and will roll it out to the responsible Call Center personnel.

I hope this solves the problem. Please feel free to offer any comments or call if any part of this process is unclear.

Dale

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held yesterday and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting.  We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues. Generally, the order is expected to expand the scope of the Commission's April 26 Order, and this report will highlight the differences.

Geographical Scope-  Mitigation is extended to cover all 11 western states.

Term- The term of the order will be extended to cover 2 summers.  We expect the order to issue today.  If so, the order will take effect at midnight tonight and continue in effect until 9/30/02.

Spot Market- Defined as sales of 24 hours or less, transacted on the day of delivery or the day prior to delivery.

Must Sell- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require all sellers to offer all their available power in real time.  All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market.   Sellers in the rest of the WSCC are similarly required to sell, except that they are not required to sell into California and can choose their spot market.  They will be required to post available power on the Western Systems Power Pool board.  Hydroelectric facilities will continue to be exempted.  

Price Mitigation-  Expanded to be in place 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Applies to all sellers, including marketers and non-public utilities.  The plan retains a single market clearing price auction for the spot market, based on marginal cost bids. The proxy price formula is changed in several respects:

	1.	Gas price will be the average of the mid-point of the monthly bid week prices as reported in Gas Daily 		for Malin, SoCal Gas Large Packages and PG&E City Gate.
	2.	O&M increases from $2 to $6.
	3.	Fuel start-up and emissions costs are eliminated from the formula and uplifted from the ISO (i.e. these 		costs will be recovered from the ISO, but will not go into setting the proxy price).
	4.	Similarly, a credit adder of 10% will apply, only in CA. 

A reserve deficiency in CA (7% or less) also triggers mitigation for the rest of the WSCC.  The applicable price during reserve deficiency periods is the proxy price outlined above.  During times when no reserve deficiency exists, the mitigated price will be 85% of the highest price calculated in the last Stage 1 emergency.  This price will be in effect until the next Stage 1 emergency.  Sellers can bid higher than the proxy, with justification, during periods of reserve deficiency or when no reserve deficiency exists; PROVIDED THAT MARKETERS MAY NOT BID ABOVE THE PROXY PRICE.  FERC will consider the entire portfolio of a seller who seeks to justify a higher price than the proxy.  Generators may seek cost based rates for their entire portfolio in CA if they so choose (i.e. no cherry picking).

Demand Side Management- The plan originally set forth in the April 26 order is expected be removed in this order. 

ISO Reporting- ISO will need to report on a quarterly basis as to the status of building supply in CA. 

Comments- Comments will be sought on the issue of whether the price mitigation formula should be adjusted in response to expected varying load conditions due to seasonal changes.

Settlement Conference-  The settlement judge will convene a settlement conference on the refund issue no later than June 25 (next Monday) and the parties will have 15 days to settle.  A report from the judge to the Commission is due 7 days thereafter (for a total of 22 days).

Issues that are NOT expected to be addressed in the order include confidentiality, ISO board issues, ISO scheduling penalty application, and market based rate authorization.  The Order is not finally issued as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of a Final Order.  We will keep you posted.

Louise,

This e:mail relates to the fact that the two Azurix people helped us out on getting the water deal done although the Azurix agreement will be terminated and Azurix will not receive any income associated with the ultimate water agreement that was put in place.  Originally they were looking at some success fees and origination totalling up to $3.1MM, but because the purchase price adjustment due to the water agreement cost ENA $5MM, they are appropriately getting nothing.  

Regards,

Chris

Subject:	Pastoria backup water contract, Mike Wood and Cole Frates 

Last Friday ENA executed an agreement to sell the Pastoria power plant project to Calpine, which we should close in the very near future.  I am writing this memo to personally indicate that we could not have done that, especially when we did, without the assistance of Mike Wood and Cole Frates.

There has been conversation around ENA that:  "...had Azurix gotten the backup water deal done last year as per their contract, we would have been able to close with Calpine then."  That may be true.  But we all have had deals that have not gone the way we planned, good effort notwithstanding.  After working with Mike and Cole on this deal, I can personally attest to the extreme difficulty they had in dealing with their counterparty for that backup contract.

I want to give special credit to Mike and Cole for their professional and tenacious behavior these last couple of months.  Notwithstanding the turmoil at Azurix and Calpine's stated desire to terminate their contract as a condition of closing (and keep just the backup contract), Mike and Cole kept their eye on the ball.  And that ball was:  "what is best for Enron."  They continued to provide detailed, expert insight to the issues.  They continued to interface with the counterparty.  They attended every meeting.  They were there until we got the backup water deal done.

I am proud to have worked with them.  All of the members of my team on this deal have exactly the same thing to say about these two guys.

Louise,

I spoke with Ben.  He, Brett and I are talking this afternoon.  I am preparing a turbine book document which will have input from (and agreement with) Brett and Ben.  Document will cover principles, objectives, summary list, strategy, etc. Canada has holiday today, but we will reach them soon.  Bid/Offer is 25-35; I will try to get Ben and Kyle to transact at mids (30); else batter up!

Hello, 

As I didn't hear anything last week on whether we had made progress on the transfer/sale of the ABB turbines (I know Ben was out too ) I thought I would put my thoughts in writing.  I am assuming that we are all on board with the fact that transferring these assets to the Turbine Book is the most efficient mechanism for dealing with the turbines going forward - please let me know if anyone thinks otherwise (excluding arguments about transfer pricing).

Transfer ABB turbines to the Turbine Book (under the management of Jacoby and Calger), capital charges to be picked up by the Turbine Book as of 7/01/01.   The Turbine Book is responsible for the turbines going forward.

Should a sale occur (negotiated by ECC) to any of the customers outlined in the documents, ECC has the right to buy back the assets at any time at the transfer price plus capital charge incurred during the period when the turbines were owned by the Turbine Book.  The call option expires 9/01/01 and can only be exercised for a sale to the counterparties in the document attached with the addition of Calpine for the purposes of a sale combined with the site (the call option for a Calpine sale is valid until 12/01/01).  If  ECC does not wish to pursue the sale to the counterparties in the document attached, then Jacoby can pursue these negotiations and if a sale is completed this year with these counterparties, the Turbine Book will receive a brokerage fee ($1 million) and ECC will pick up capital costs between 7/01/01 and the completion of the sale. 

Please agree to a transfer price for these turbines, if a price cannot be agreed between you, please let me have your arguments substantiating your transfer price and I will arbitrate on the number on Friday.  Let me know if anyone disagrees with moving forward in this way.

Regards

Louise

FYI.  I ran into Bryson last Friday.  He told me (insisted, in fact) that Edison was paying everyone in February.  He told me (insisted, again) that they would have all necessary approvals from the PUC in the next several weeks.  He said that once those approvals are in place, they'll quickly get financing in place to ensure a February payment date--for everyone.  I said that was great news but that the market didn't seem quite as certain.  He was pretty firm.  He also said that it was too late for anyone to take them into bankruptcy involuntarily, that a judge wouldn't go for it. 

Did you know if Lay every talk to Bryson?

Best,
Jeff

Louise,

As of today, I intend to be at Monday's PRC (Sue is doing fine) and catch an 8:30PM flight back.  I am preparing a PRC report for you and Tim in the event I do not make it.  The report will be easier to deal with than the PEP reports and will reflect my summary evaluation of Analysts, Associates, Managers, Directors, and VPs in my group.

as a desk that has generated a tremendous amount of cash over the last couple of years and holds vastly more margin from its counterparties than our counterparties are holding of ours, how does this policy change impact us?  i have asked this question every six months for the last two years and the answer has typically been that it is too hard to implement.  with respect to capital, the west power desk has been subsidizing other parts of ena for a while.

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

Antelope is a project that we acquired last year from AES.  The project has land, some early permits, and a transmission queue position that we used at Pastoria.  Total consideration paid to AES was approximately $15MM, most of which was charged to Pastoria.  The resulting cost basis should be about $1.8MM plus the ERC's not used at Pastoria (approx. $6MM).  Over the next 4 months we will determine whether we want to pursue the project or, if not, write off the $1.8MM and sell/transfer the ERC's for a gain of $1.8MM+.

Coyote Springs was a project that we developed and sold in 2000.  It was a 280MW 7FA that we co-developed with Portland General and sold pre-construction to Avista for a $18MM promote.  There should not be any balance sheet exposure associated with it- we are done.

	As a heads up, we just got an unconfirmed report that Jeff Gertz, investigative reporter for the New York Times, is apparently writing a "front page story" for the NYT.  While still in draft, the article will focus on "Enron price gouging in California."  That's about all we know at this point, but will try to learn more details.     

	By way of background, I understand that Gertz is a Pulitzer prize winning journalist.  He has a reputation of being aggressive.  His last two NYT articles have been on the California situation and were entitled "Some Evidence Of Overcharges" (Mar 23) and "Critics Say U.S. Energy Agency is Weak in Oversight of Utilities" (also Mar 23).   By way of some of my personal interests, he also broke the story on the Los Alamos Wen Ho Lee spy case and subsequently in February a sccop on the FBI bungled investigation of Lee.

My latest information on rate increases in California indicates that they will be implemented June 1st.  That means that customers don't see a price signal until June and won't actually see their bill until July.  While I agree with Greg that we may see dramatic demand side response once people see their bills, we have no idea how long it will take people and businesses to adjust their behavior.  I don't really care what positions you guys want to carry.  My only advice is that Greg is short a fairly illiquid product.  If you want to get out right now you would have to pay, at least for some of your position, north of $800/MWh.  In the near term I don't think that it will be easy to get out of this trade.  In the long run, if the market comes off, it will be easy to get out.  

Bottom line --
At the end of the day I think that you may be right, but things look very bullish right now.  I want to make sure that you know that you have already pushed the bounds of liquidity for that product and that you should not expect us to provide liquidity to you in a market that doesn't offer it to us when it is time to get out.

We executed the purchase and sale agreement today.  Closing should occur in late October/early November and is subject only to bank and partner consents.  Bank consent will require NRG getting a  legal opinion on NRG's ability to close without violating QF status (we believe this is a non-issue but will require some handholding).  Our internal and Sale proceeds will be approx $20.793MM split between JEDI and ENA.

Still like CDWR - PG&E bankruptcy was not expected today, but not a big surprise overall.  

Fountain Valley looks like $16.6MM - half in QII , half in QIII

Subject:	Update

Louise,

Turbine Swap:
The Hancock letters were acceptable to Chip and me.  Legal got comfort from GE that the consent language will be consistent with what we have done before.  Based on that, we got done with Delta and GE.  We are preparing the definitive agreements for Delta in order to keep the pressure on them to close and fund mid-month - ultimate drop-dead is May 3.

Pastoria:
Pre-closed yesterday; funds will flow April 11 

Fountain Valley:
Pre-closed this morning; funds will flow April 11 (need 5 business day notice for turbopark)

DWR:
Discussions continue (calm after the storm) - I am trying to push them towards a deal that has less up-front credit exposure.  It might look like a June start with volumes increasing later in 2001

Roseville:
Approval requests will come in two phases - a $1MM "I-DASH" early next week for an option on ERC's and some environmental consulting work.  A Big DASH ($45MM) in a couple of weeks for the full project development budget.   

Goldendale:
Giving them a non-binding proposal tomorrow to buy the project - I will get on your calender to update

Las Vegas:
Putting together toll, EPC, final development - will get on your calender next week to review

INGA:
Decision over the next couple of days to launch a binding bid to Ahlstrom to try to get their attention - or just kill the file

Regards,

Chris

Louise,

I want to sign a confidentiality and exclusivity agreement with ABB with respect to our San Francisco T-Line Project.  There are no payment or service terms other than the concept that we are granting exclusivity to each other for two years. 

Reasons:
- I want to get some inexpensive resources from them to help us design and develop the project;
- I want to lock them up early since they are the clear industry leader and the puclic entities in CA may ultimately RFP.

My understanding is that approval is needed from you, John or Detmering.

Is this OK with you?

Regards,

Chris Calger

Subject:	Transmission Line Project-ABB Agreement

Re-sending with minor changes to the prior documents.  A clean copy is now provided.

Lance Schuler advised me that it is now Jeff Donahue, rather than Mark Metz, that needs to sign off on Corp's behalf, and that either Tim Detmering, Louise Kitchen or John Lavorato can approve on behalf of ENA.

  

A redraft of the ABB confidentiality/exclusive dealings agreement is attached for review and comment.

This document is based on the form ABB provided and for which ABB has expressed a strong preference.  

This draft calls for bilateral exclusivity for the Term (2 years).  As several of us have discussed, this will prevent ENA from choosing an alternative technology or supplier during that time should it choose to construct a DC transmission line within a 15-mile radius of San Francisco.  As I understand it, we are prepared to link arms with ABB to do this project because ABB is the premier supplier of this type of equipment. 

Based on recent discussions between Wayne and ABB, the language necessary for creating the exclusivity arrangement has been added to the form of confidentiality agreement that we had been working on with ABB earlier.  The added language is somewhat lengthy, but was necessary to establish the relationship and at the same time protect ENA against arguments that we are obligated to proceed with the potential transaction.  

Because this transaction does commit ENA to exclusivity obligations I understand that we will need to talk with Tim Detmering and Mark Metz about the transaction.  

Please let me know of comments.

AES 		$11MM
Calpine 		$18MM

AES - Pacific has been very flaky with us in the past; Calpine is pretty real.

Calpine and NRG risk management guys wanted to know if we would make a market in turbine call options - great idea (yours) but I am afraid they want our bid.

Chris,

I have received a number of emails.  Only one (CP&L) was asking specifically about the turbines.  The other two (Calpine and NRG) are more interested in the turbine call option concept as a risk management tool.

I will keep you posted on the contacts.  I placed a call back to CP&L, and email reply to Calpine.  NRG call is planned for the afternoon.  

The turbine option is not clickable yet.  My citrix server is experiencing some problems.  The helpdesk is working on it.

Steve

Silence from Chino the last 2 days.  We were supposed to hear Tuesday am.
Marine Diesel is bringing a buyer to site tomorrow.  Supposedly they are ready to go for  a project overseas with a JV between HQ and probably the main utility in France.  They are ready with funds for the deposit.  Of course I've heard that before, but the broker is very excited so it may have some truth.
Nevertheless,  I gather you're pressuring Steve to go click live on EOL.  I understand we need to move on this, and just pray no one is so foolhardy to click until we get these other buyers sorted out (unless it's a front run of these potential buyers Chino and the French outfit).
Also, Tesco is back in the game with the California Power Authority and Water District - their timing is early next week.

Louise,

If you think the message was weird, let me tell you about the conversation...launch a public campaign against the mayor of Portland, the Port of Portland, align ourselves with the pro-Salmon environmentalists, pass legislation, and if we are lucky we get 800 prime acres for residential development!  Don't expect to see it on the hotlist.

Cheers,

Chris

I am repsonsible for Middle Market Coverage for West Power in Portland.   We spoke a week or so ago re: the ENA/EES customer split methodology.  I will be in Houston next Monday and Tuesday (April 9/10).  I would like to spend a half hour or so with you, if you had time, to brief you on what's going in the Middle Market Group in Portland, reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed.  You may be getting some info. from Tim and/or internal reports, but I figured, since I was going to be in Houston, it would be a good chance to fill in some details. 

I had asked John Lavorato if he wanted to meet, but he indicated (see below) that it would be more appropriate to meet with you.  Tim B. also indicated I should try to meet you as well.   Let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you.

Thanks!

Chris

Louise,

I only spent an hour on this.  However, I would pass.  This would keep a lot of orig/tech/finance people employed for a while in order to manage it and then work off the pieces.  

This looks like a fairly impressive private asset company - they appear to be good developers, acquirers, etc.  They even say that they that restructured 8 of their PPA's - presumably they restructured the ones that make sense - further reduces our restructuring proposition.  

To me, the QF optionality goes like this:  
- If you have a high-variable cost QF that operates as a baseload facility, the math works to shut it down or convert to a peaking PPA when the market is low.  
- If the market is high, you have an easy-to-develop expansion.

Problem is, their assets appear to have low variable costs (coal and new gas) so the restructuring play does not jump out at me
...and we are bearish on development

At PV18, this could look like a good diversified low risk business - superior to most of our regulated businesses and most of our international businesses, but I think it would be real tough to get returns >30%.  Besides, I think someone will pay more for it.  Over half the net MW is new 7FA capacity - attractive to Calpine and the Calpine wanabees.   This is actually a cheap way for an IPP to hit its MW growth targets without blowing their brains out in the spot market.  

Someone should pay up - not us.   

Question: Did we form qf teams in the east and west because of the success of East Coast Power?  Was that success largely driven by the fact that we bought it cheap?  Or did we innovatively restructure the PPA?  If we brought innovative financing to the deal, isn't that the same as buying it cheap?  Was East Coast Power a formal auction or was it a negotiated deal? 

I can dig into this some more if you'd like.  Our internal model would be my next step.  Let me know.

Regards,

Chris Calger

Mark Golden is an excellent reporter covering the Power Scene.

OUR TAKEAWAYS:
* Power prices are declining in California as the "destruction of demand"
effect of higher retail power prices kicks in.
* The long-term power contracts signed by the various Power Producers and
Energy Merchants are looking like sweetheart deals for them, as evidence of
price weakness (from a base of extremely high prices) is beginning to
develop.
* The movement in prices in California is reflective of the message in our
Power Curve 4 report, where we show that forward prices are peaking this
summer.  Year/year power price comparisons are now projected to be flat
4Q:01, and declining afterwards.

POWER POINTS:Great News! Long-Term Contracts Jeopardized

   By Mark Golden
   A Dow Jones Newswires Column

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Those looking for even the slightest bit of good
news
for the state of California can find it in Friday's San Jose Mercury News.
"California is in danger of losing more than 40% of the power it has lined
up in
long-term contracts," says the lead of a major article, because Republicans
in
the state legislature didn't back the $12.5 billion bond deal last week.
  Getting out of most of those contracts would be the best thing to happen
to
California in a long time.
  Since the state went on its long-term buying binge, forward prices for
power
in the western U.S. have been falling steadily. Gov. Gray Davis announced
$43
billion in purchases lasting up to 20 years on March 5. Contracts for summer
power at Palo Verde, Ariz., a key western trading hub that feeds a lot of
power
into California, have fallen to $390 a megawatt-hour from a high of $600/MWh
in
late March. Further out, power for 2004-2006 at mid-Columbia River, a key
trading hub north of California, has fallen from $58/MWh in February to
$49/MWh
today.
  Companies like Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Dynegy (DYN) that took advantage of
the
state's buying binge are looking pretty fat and happy. In fact, they have
affectionately started calling the governor Gravy Days. Enron Corp. (ENE),
which
has been selling aggressively for two months, according to traders, is
looking
like a genius as usual. Generators that held out, like Reliant Energy (REI)
and
Duke Energy (DUK), may be sorry that they did.
  It's been a long time since those long on western power have felt serious
pain
in the markets, but that time has come. Power generators may not make as
much
profit this summer as last, and power traders that have taken long
speculative
positions may liquidate supplies for far less than they bought them. As was
seen
in the eastern U.S. power markets last summer, long positions can turn out
just
as painful as short positions.
  For California, the good news is that maybe spot purchasing costs this
summer
won't be as bad as once expected. The bad news is that the state government
is
by far the biggest "long" in the bearish forward market. It's safe to say
that
the $43 billion in contracts signed in March have declined in value by 15%,
or
$6.5 billion. That's almost as big of a financial disaster going forward as
everything that has gone on since last summer until now.
  Granted, this is a sort of damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't situation.
Barring the utilities from the forward market during the first three years
of
deregulation was one of the most expensive public policy mistakes in U.S.
history. California should do some forward purchasing now, and it's such a
behemoth that it will move the market up when it does so. And, when it gets
done
buying, prices will come down simply because it stopped.
  But that's a footnote to the mismanagement of the financial side of the
energy
crisis. Early this year, when the state started down the path of
mega-purchasing, there was no shortage of advice not to do so. Long-term
prices
were embedded with too much of today's supply-demand imbalance. The state
would
have been much better off dealing with the imbalance first - since it would
have
to do that anyway - and gradually securing forward power as declining prices
reflected the improving situation.
  Since then, the state has done a great job of crushing demand. Electric
usage
is already down 9% from where it was expected to be thanks to a conservation
efforts and a slowing economy, and people haven't even seen their 30% higher
bills yet. Similar reduction has been seen in power consumption in other
western
states and in natural gas usage nationally. This is likely what has been
behind
much of the downturn in forward power prices in the West.
  This column started with a false "good news" lead. It would be great for
the
state if, after the state's credit rating sinks further, sellers exercised
their
option to tear up the five- and ten-year contracts. But they won't do that.
The
prices are too good from the sellers' perspective. Calpine, which has signed
three such contracts for the state, said immediately that it has no
intention of
reneging on its agreements. And Gary Ackerman, director of the sellers'
association, told the Mercury News that he didn't expect power companies in
general to back out of the deals.
  But there may be some real good news for California. The Davis
administration
hired dozens of people that have little or no experience in energy trading
to
purchase billions of dollars of power. Perhaps they are quick learners. This
week presented an excellent opportunity for the state to pick up what it
needs -
summer power for this year only - on sale. Low prices in the daily market
Monday
and Tuesday drove the summer contract prices down to $325/MWh, which is
cheap by
recent standards. The contract price moved up to $390/MWh, but the state
took
advantage of the opportunity while the window was open.
  "The week's condition in the market place helped. We were able to procure
some
energy for June through September," said state spokesman Oscar Hidalgo.
  And, hey, there were no blackouts this week.

We haven't lost the Smurfit deal yet, but the client believes it is taking us too long to clarify our credit parameters for this deal.  

The individuals in Bill Bradford's group are extremely qualified and hard working.  There are just not enough of them.  We greatly appreciate your considering if additional resources are needed.

Calpine just confirmed the following:  Tomorrow they will commit to 50-100 per day of Kern expansion.  They will commit 100/day if Enron commits to take 50 of it if the project sale does not close.  If Enron does not commit to the 50, they will only go in for 50 and Enron will not have any rights to it.  

Bottom line - we have gone from needing to commit to 100/day of transport to 0-50 per day.  We will need to decide on this tomorrow morning.

All:

Attached is a CSFB synopsis of PG&E's Plan Of Reorganization (POR).    The key to successful Consummation of the POR is being able to move PG&E's retained generating assets (primarily Diablo Canyon Nuclear and the hydro) from CPUC jurisdiction to FERC jurisdiction, under a disaggregation of the assets (Genco, Disco, ElecTransco & GasTransco).   The current cost of service generation rate at CPUC for these assets is approximately 2.8 cents per kwh.   The POR envisions a PPA between Genco and Disco at approximately 4.5 cents per kwh.  The FERC would use a concept of benchmarking in approving this rate.   Benchmarking is a market rate comparison. 

While the POR contemplates no rate increase from the existing average generation rate of 9.4 cents per kwh, with the now lower CDWR revenue requirement, the CPUC could possibly reduce rates in the interim.   This could give the CPUC cover in alleging that the POR is a rate increase.   The critical legal point in the POR is preemption in the Bankruptcy court.  Under this doctrine, Federal law can preempt State law, as part of the POR.   Judge Montali will have to approve this move.   While PG&E envisions POR Consummation by 12/31/02, given the precedent setting nature of this move and what will surely be an adverse CPUC attitude, the process could drag on longer as it is fully adjudicated through the appeals process.

On our claims, the POR at Consumation would pay 60 cents cash and 40 cents in reconstituted notes designed to trade at par.  Interest would be paid from POR Confirmation to Consummation.  Our $403 million in PX credits claims are listed as contested.   The challenges listed are based on: 1) the rate freeze having ended and 2) the effect of FERC price mitigation on the PX clearing price.


Regards,


Michael

The ISO Market Surveillance Committee recently filed a report at FERC where it estimated the excess profits earned by in-state generators and importers as a direct result of individual exercise of market power.  They came up with a number of approximately $500 million.  They then quantified the impact that this had on the rest of the market and came up with a number of around $6 billion.  They used codes to identify individual market participants.  The media has now received the matching of code names to company names.  The Oregonian picked up an LA Times - Washington Post Service article yesterday highlighting the excess profits earned by PowerEx, BPA, and LADWP.  Enron Energy Services is rumored to be on this list.  I have no idea why.  I thought I'd give you guys a heads up in case media calls start coming in.  Alan Comnes (503-464-8129) is probably the best source if you want more facts on this.

I believe John Milar works for Eric Gadd.  He has spoken with a couple of my guys about developing a LM2500 at one of Transwestern's compressor stations.  Despite what I told Eric a couple of months ago, they seem to be moving forward.  They have received pricing from EEOS and asked Bill Williams in our Tech Services Group to check the EEOS numbers.  I will look into it further and report back.

FYI -we negotiated a unilateral management out through next Friday so I suspect there will be some internal discussion about the toll early next week.  Since Chip and Brian were plugged in every step of the way I hope we wont try to reneg on the deal, but if we made a big mistake late last night we could go back to  Allegheny.  Should not be a problem, but thought you should know.

Louise,

If I can get a counterparty to prepay us $3MM for a physical power sale, can I reduce my capital charge on $3MM of ERC's?

Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names

*	We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
*	Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
*	Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
*	By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.

Joe and Louise:

I was on a conf call today re ERC Financing.  Legal and Finance were on the call.  The consensus was that it would be difficult.  

The structure involves selling the ERC's at market to an entity controlled by the bank; buying a call from that entity; selling a put to that entity; having a price swap (fixed/floating) with entity.  The bank would also want to understand market liquidity, price transparency and the rules of every district we have ERC's in.  The Texas SOX deal recently put into this vehicle was much simpler in a more liquid market, but it took 4 months and $1MM of legal fees to put together.  The lawyers involved believe that it would be more difficult and likely more expensive for the California ERC's - we have several districts and several products.  

$1MM+ internal resources seems like a lot for a $20MM-$30MM balance with an  expected term of one year - especially with uncertain success due to the price transparency issues (no index price).

Any thoughts?

It's getting strange...

Calpine wants to see our offer:

Big Prepay - $200MM - $300MM
EPMI Sells 200MW+ 7x24 
DP: NP-15 or SP-15
Price: $61 
Start: 7/02
Term: 5-10 years

Rationale: They have $61 DWR contracts.  At this point the DWR contracts are tied to their accrual generation business.  If we pay them for the right to sell $61's, they can get the cash and recognize the earnings.  

Like the rest of this story, selling to a generator sounds strange.  However, if the forward market is trading below their stated price forecast, they may want to buy, not sell.  

Perhaps we go down a parallel path: bids in the East, offers in the west.  

Maybe we end up in a seller-financing deal: loan $ for investment in New Power and purchase of sites, equipment, ERC's.  

Dave and I are available to compare notes and discuss strategy.

Regards,

Chris Calger

Louise,

This draft is very preliminary.  We have not received any input from the Market Risk group or Regulatory.  I have passed for comments to David Port and Jim Steffes.  My initial view on Risk Adjusted Capital for Market Risk is that it will be zero based on the offsetting position currently in the book.  We will have more information in the morning.

We can discuss further tomorrow.

Thanks,
Bill

Per the request of Bill Bradford, attached please find an initial draft of the DASH for the DWR put option.  Please note that we are waiting on a final, legal risk memorandum as well as comments from Jim Steffes for the regulatory risks.

Please let us know if you have any questions or initial comments.

FYI Folks-

The Kern River expansion that we backed out of (the 15 year stuff) is going to be 900,000 MMBtu/d.  As you can see a large number of the shippers stayed in the process, and are now bound to the pipe if it gets built!!

I told DWR that Enron is not comfortable with the risk/reward of the transaction.  They are reviewing the following modification:
 
April Price: $200
May and beyond: $127
7 day payments through April 30
Standard EEI payment terms thereafter
Credit for Feb, Mar, April ($17MM) paid 7 days after investment grade bonds are issued 
ENA has right to walk at any time for any reason up until the earlier of 7 days after bonds issued or Sep 1
Cal Reg Out (with termination payment) modified to include ballott initiatives and CPUC orders

This is effectively a $5MM premium for a 4MMMwhr put swaption 

I will update when I hear back from them.

Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5



If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

On our two quotes, my comment on the first quote is important; the second might sound a little better but says the same thing.  

The Pastoria Energy Center represents the second major power project developed in California by Enron since 1999, ...

Enron remains committed to helping meet the growing need for reliable and affordable electricity in California through the development of other highly efficient projects.

My only comment is that the project is referred to Pastoria Energy Facility and Pastoria Energy Center.  The name of the LLC is Pastoria Energy Facility LLC.  Calpine's wholly-owned sub, Pasotia Energy Center LLC, will be purchasing 100% of ENA's membership interest in Pastoria Energy Facility.

Subject:=09EES @ Silicon Valley Power (City of Santa Clara)

Mike & Chris,

I received a phone call from Wayne Ware of Silicon Valley Power ("SVP") thi=
s morning.  Apparently, EES met with SVP on Tuesday, July 24th to discuss t=
he sale of power and services through the City to targeted end-use customer=
s on an exclusive basis.

Based upon Wayne's comments, SVP staff's response was not favorable.  Ware =
offered the following comments:

1)  SVP dismissed the exclusivity element at the outset.
2)  EES's product is perceived to compete directly with SVP's core competen=
cy - provision of a fixed priced, load followed product.  SVP indicated tha=
t it currently offers term (up to 5 years), fixed priced, load followed pow=
er to its customers.  According to Wayne, over 100 MW's (20% of SVP's load)=
 is served this way.
3)  Ware opined that EES does not understand what SVP does or offers its cu=
stomers.  SVP was perplexed by this given that Wayne Truxillo (the EES rep.=
) worked for SVP and set up many of the fixed price programs that are curre=
ntly in place.
4)  SVP views EES's offering as a wholesale product.
5)  SVP also had concerns about EES's reputation and history in California =
citing the University of California fiasco.  SVP didn't think an EES produc=
t would be well received among its customers.

What is disturbing is that Mike and I asked both Truxillo and Ader if we co=
uld be included in these meetings or, at a minimum, be given the opportunit=
y to talk with our customers beforehand.  EES excluded us from this process=
.  Mike indicated that Ader was worried I would sabotage EES's efforts; tha=
t I would tell SVP that EES's proposal is a wholesale product replicating S=
VP's core competency of delivering a fixed priced, load followed product.  =
Mike and I had a somewhat heated discussion with Ader about their product o=
ffering.  Ader characterized the product as retail on the basis that it wou=
ld be sold one customer at a time and involved load following.  That the pr=
oduct is to be sleeved through SVP (actually sold to SVP for re-sale) and t=
herefore is a wholesale product was dismissed.  Ader also indicated that EE=
S would be offering behind the meter demand related services, which further=
 characterized their product as retail.  What is clear is that EES is searc=
hing for physical power sales.  They can offer behind the meter solutions w=
ithout the help or involvement of SVP.  Their product offering, once the de=
corations are removed, is a physical power sale.

As was our concern, we will now have to manage this issue, reacting to EES'=
s actions.

Ugh!!!

we have had trouble valueing transmission, literally forever.  we finally released a spread option model last night to value transmission.  it spit out some huge values for out of the money transmission because it is valued as a daily option.  for example, transmission from big eddy (in the northwest) to nob spit out a value of $28 million -- all extrinsic.  given the state of affairs in california right now, i find it highly unlikely that we will take power from the northwest to deliver into the capped market.  last night we recognized $16 million of transmission value, almost all intrinsic value associated with closing open positions.  we reserved $36 million associated with extrinsic value.  we will revalue the options once a week and make appropriate adjustments to the reserves.  let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Attached please find a spreadsheet that describes the prepays we completed this week.  In summary, we bought power supplies through December 31 from Allegheny, AEP, Avista, Idacorp, and PNM and delivered to over 15 in the money contracts.  The power cost approximately $3.3MM and will generate a post-petition receivable in excess of $12MM.  Next week we will identify the January schedule and recommended purchases/deliveries.  Apologies for any wiring firedrills.

Is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the Mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee.  I know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $10mm to cancel the contracts?  If we could do we want to do this?  

How much money would we lose (how much of a write down would we take) if I told you I wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of September?  

As an aside, the Mitsubishis will be leaving the Enron Americas Balance Sheet now and moving to EGAS.  This does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward.  For the company overall, we need to move these turbines (as with all the others) as soon as possible and we (in the Americas) are in a much better position than EGAS is to move them.  I have spoken to Jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward.

I spoke with Parquet and Mcdonald re contracts and offered the following:

Parquet:
Base - $200 - no increase
Signing - $100
Equity - $250

Mcdonald:
Base - $175 - no increase
Signing - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet's is identical to what you offered; Mcdonald is significantly less than Parquet and right in between Parquet and Dyer (50/150).

David Parquet is currently on an employment agreement which expires on 12/1/2001.  Chris would like to be proactive in signing Dave up again for another 2 years.  

Dave's current contract details are:

Base:		$200,000 (due to SF cost of living)
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/00
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/01

Chris is proposing:

Base:  		$215,000 (or $200,000 with a COLA payment of $15,000 for each year of term)
Signing: 	$100,000
Equity:		$350,000 (50/50)

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

Deal Update:

Las Vegas:  Completed final review of Allegheny toll, waived management out. Approved and executed bridge loan.  Gave notice to proceed to EPC contractor.  Received preliminary, non-binding bids from Northland Power (NP) and Black Hills (BH) for implied promote of $20MM and $30MM, respectively.  Updating data room and will start parallel process: negotiate with NP/BH and start broader auction process.  Told NP/BH that the race is on - the earlier they sign binding agreement, the less competition they have - expect June 30 with closing August 31.

Saguaro:  CSFB is selling Mission's 50% interest in Saguaro.  We have agreed to piggyback on the investment bank's process in order to sell our 15% interest.  Binding bids are due June 8 - expect Q3 close.

Palo Alto:  Got 25MW Flat NP-15 term sale done - orig only $100K, but desk,credit and customer happy.

DWR: Waiting on pro-forma financials and new agreement between DWR and PUC that better secures credit.  Bonds just got approved - 90 day wait.  Negotiating EEI for short term deals as well.  DWR bid has $80MM over mid, but I appear to be only one that thinks we should do a term deal with DWR.  I will stay on top of this - these guys are the new big player in the market.

Roseville: RAC has recommended approval and we are circulating for signature.  Payment of $6MM to Georgia Pacific for ERC's due next week.  Balance of $43MM to be spent over next 18 months.  Calpine and Allegheny want to buy in - its a little early, but we might explore that in Q4 or Q102.

Roseville Prepay:  Someone else (Calpine or Duke) was more aggressive on the NP-15 term commodity offer so we are out - our best offer was mids+$5; someone else offfered at our mids.  We are trying to see if we can partrner with the winner since our bid for cash may be higher.

Reliant: Potential Sale of a 4.5 Year 100MW Peak Mid-C Daily Call Option:  Fixed monthly capacity payment with strike equal to Sumas X 10.5.  We are close on this and might close Monday.

Text of Gov. Gray Davis' energy speech
The Associated Press


   , , -- (04-05) 18:08 PDT Here is the text of Gov. Gray Davis' televised
speech on energy Thursday, as prepared for delivery:
   "Good evening. I'm speaking to you tonight from Sacramento on the most
difficult issue facing California: our energy crisis.
   "Simply stated, we have two problems: supply is too low and costs are too
high. Both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996. But
no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to solve problems. And
that's what I'm doing.
   "The only long-term solution is to build more power plants. We must also
cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities. But prices won't fall
and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more power than we
consume.
   "Yet in the 12 years before I took office, not a single major power plant
was built in California. Not one. Since I became governor, we've licensed
12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And we're doing this
without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water.
   "Deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power
plants to independent generating companies. The generators are free to
charge whatever they want because they're governed only by federal
regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices.
   "This past winter, the prices charged by the generators shot through the
roof, driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy.
   "In January, with the feds still refusing to do their job, California
stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to
buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the
power on and the economy strong. That's not all:
   -- We also negotiated long-term contracts for electricity at vastly lower
prices.
   -- I used my emergency powers to seize control of low-cost power contracts
the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators.
   -- We began negotiations to buy the utilities' transmission system.
   -- We cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of
power plants.
   -- We're launching an $800 million conservation program.
   -- We're moving to establish a public power authority to build more power.
If the private sector fails to build all the plants California needs,
we'll build them ourselves.
   -- And because I share your concern that the generators are ripping us
off, we're using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal
conduct.
   "We can't fix 12 years of inaction overnight. But we're making real
progress.
   "Now, as you know, I have fought tooth and nail against raising rates.
It's become increasingly clear, however, that with rising natural gas
prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of
supply, that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our
economy strong.
   "But I remain committed to protecting average Californians from massive
rate hikes. So I'm urging the Public Utilities Commission to adopt a plan
that will protect average consumers, reward those who conserve and
motivate the biggest users to cut back.
   "Under my proposal, more than half of you won't pay a penny more. For the
rest, the average increase will be 26 1/2 percent. For many of that group,
rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest users will see their
rates rise 34 1/2 percent on average. That includes business paying their
share. This is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we've all been
paying since last winter.
   "But all Californians can reduce their bills through conservation.
   "Here's the point: The more you use, the more you pay. The more you
conserve, the more you save. Conservation is our best short-term weapon
against blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your power, you'll help
secure our energy future.
   "Unlike the PUC, my plan includes funds to restore the utilities to
financial stability -- if they agree to three main conditions:
   "They must provide low-cost regulated power to the state for 10 years.
Agree to sell us their transmission system. And dismiss their lawsuits
seeking to double your electricity rates.
   "My proposal raises rates fairly, assures us of long-term power,
stabilizes the utilities and promotes conservation.
   "Our emphasis on conservation is critical. In order to make it through the
summer, we must cut demand by at least 10 percent.
   "Already we've launched programs to cut back commercial lighting, and
reduce consumption in office buildings, schools and government facilities.
   "Friends, we have a power shortage but we are far from powerless. We are
34 million strong and if each of us does our part, we can minimize
disruptions and get through the summer. We are Californians. We've
withstood earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.
   "Yes, this mess is man-made, but with your help and God's blessing, we'll
get through this as well.
   "Thank you and good night."

We have another opportunity to sell to DWR.  I have been in discussions with Ray Hart of DWR and Ron Nichols, their consultant. We are closing in on a structure that has less upfront risk for Enron with a larger overall short position in the back.  They want to move to contract negotiations next week.  I would appreciate your input.  I will arrange a conference call with the legal and credit teams for Monday to review the status of our EEI contract and the requirements for this potential deal.  Notional terms:

i heard dave's voicemail.  i appreciate his concern.  however, i don't thin=
k that the delineation is easy to do.  i am confident that my team knows wh=
at we are good at and what we aren't good at.  if we aren't best suited to =
serve the load, we will act like "one enron" and send the account over to t=
he them.  the split should really be driven by the customer's needs and whi=
ch utility they are behind.  for example, montana power has a wonderful bal=
ancing tariff where the utility looks at the scheduled volume and compares =
it to the actual volumes and settles directly with the customer for imbalan=
ces.  we don't do any metering, we don't do any unique billing, the loads r=
ange anywhere from 1 MW to 25 MW.  ena is definitely best suited to serve t=
hese industrials because commodity price is their top interest.  the pugest=
 system is about to open up with a structure that is similar to montana's. =
 ena will be very well positioned to serve this load.  the same company cou=
ld have a plant in california.  we wouldn't serve that load because the exp=
ertise needed to manage the ctc risk (before this thing blew up anyway), th=
e challenge of metering and tracking metered volumes on a schedule vs. actu=
al basis, and the load forecasting.  the same company could also own gas st=
ations in the west.  we have no interest in serving gas stations.

i also heard the message attached to dave's from scott dann (sp?).  his mes=
sage did little to open communication between groups.  he provided no detai=
ls on what the issue was in the west with respect to epmi (ena) and ees.  f=
or us to do this right, ees and ena need to be able to solve problems witho=
ut involving the office of the chair of each company.  i would be happy to =
work with anyone from ees to resolve who should be covering which accounts.

i still can't think of a clean way to divide customers.  each approach has =
its problems.  each company (ees and ena) has its strengths.  our strength =
is commodity pricing and delivering a mw to anywhere on the western grid.  =
their strength is in tariff analysis, energy management, and aggregating lo=
ads.

for the west, i am confident that chris calger and i can sort out any dispu=

Las Vegas:
Allegheny's bid was strong but required a financing out for 45 days - unacceptable.  Black Hills' bid has a clean purchase and sale markup with a bid that implies a $35MM gain for ENA ($10MM has to go to Calpers since they are an investor in LV 1).  They are going to their board Thursday and want to execute by early next week and close Aug 31.  We will try to get a higher bid from Northland this week ($40MM gain).  They will require a two-week financing out which they will secure with a $10MM non-refundable deposit.  If we sign with Northland, they can close in July.

In either case, accounting may require us to recognize this income this quarter because Las Vegas is a fair market value investment.   RAC requires a DASH to sell an asset of this size - we will circulate on Wednesday or Thursday.

One long shot deal we are proposing to Allegheny:  Tear up the existing 15 year toll backed by the Las Vegas project.  Enter into a 15 year firm energy sale from EPMI at Palo Verde.  The value of that deal may be in excess of $100MM since the market has fallen so much.  If we did that, we would have a merchant asset that would have to be sold at or near cost - this is achievable.  This would be significantly riskier than our current plan and would probably require board approval, but the value makes it worth exploring.


AMPS:
We continue to push Geneva Steel and Oregon Steel for permitting info.  West power markets have fallen further so the economics are marginal at best.  Friday's curves suggested a value of $10MM vs a cost of $17MM.  An imperfect put swaption would cost $4MM, further eroding the value.  I spoke to Brett Wiggs on Friday and forwarded him technical specs and reviewed different deal structures that might work.

DWR:
They announced Thursday that they have signed more definitive long term deals that they will honor (approx 6,500MW long term).  The non-binding "agreements in principle" will be renegotiated because prices have fallen so much.  DWR signed our Master Agreement for short term deals but Tim does not want to execute it because of litigation risk.  We will not do anything with them at this time.

Generator Tolls:  Interest has fallen off due to rapid drop in power prices.  We are still talking with 6-7 parties, but I dont think anything will get done soon.  

Munis:  Mcdonald got a small term sale done at NP-15 with city of Lassen.  Approx $600K of orig.

New Marketing Initiatives:
Negotiating 3 generator service agreements.  Mostly small plants coming on line this year.  The entrepreneurs behind these deals are shell shocked by the low prices , but many have already committed capital.  

Montana: - State forced divestiture of generation.  Retail load is short starting July 1, 2002.  Governor's office has asked us to bring a 700MW 10 year "solution".  They are willing to issue a $500MM bond to prepay and buydown part of the energy.  The basic play is to swap an EPMI Mid-C position for an in-state position from PPL, package that up with some renewables and sell to the state under a prepaid PPA.  Long shot but interesting.

CA Industrials:  A group of industrials want to buy up to 800MW NP-15 delivered for 5+ years as part of a negotiated settlement with CA.  Gov Affairs is working on a Core/Non-Core structure with the state that would potentially lead to open access for all industrial load if they pay a big exit fee to cover the stranded costs incurred during the past 12 months.

Total Loss of $20 million on prelim will be reduced to $13 on the final.  Mike S. reduced the NW delivered basis by $1/MWh when it should have been increased by $1/MWh against a basis position of roughly 3 million MWh accounted for the change of $6 million.  In addition, our NOB curve (which is a basis off of COB) had been mismarked (too low) by between $25/MWh to $50/MWh.  Mike doesn't know how it got marked so low.  We are short NOB, so he wasn't trying to hide money.  We are using a new curve file and position manager, so there's a chance that the application isn't working right, but it's more likely that Mike screwed something up.  Net effect of this is roughly $5 million hit (offsetting illgotten gains of the same amount before).  This brings us down to a one-day change of roughly $8 million associated with the back of the curve moving up.

With gas coming off today, the backs have moved down some.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Per our discussion this morning, below is a summary of items to discuss with Glynn:

Adding Enron's "negative CTC claim" to the list of claims: PGE's filing included a list of top twenty creditors.  Our negative CTC claim was apparently not taken into account in compiling that list.  The list is nonbinding, however.  PG&E will be required to file schedules of creditors on April 20.  Our negative CTC claim should be on Schedule F (for unsecured claims).  You may want to remind Glynn of your previous conversations and state our expectation that the negative CTC claim will appear (preferably as uncontested) in the April 20 filing. (Note: if PG&E does not include the claim we have an opportunity to file a proof of claim and ultimately the court determines the validity of the claim).
Including Enron on the Creditors' Committee:  PG&E may have the opportunity to influence representation on the creditors' committees.  There are several reasons to suggest to Glynn that we be included: 1) we are a big creditor, 2) we could be helpful in crafting a broader solution, and 3) we are one of the real parties in interest behind the PX and ISO (who were listed as significant creditors but are really just "passthroughs" for the suppliers ... and PG&E likely would not want to have those political bodies serving on the creditors committee anyway).

Subject:	Re: Approval procedure for Pending Products   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

 We are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products, the scheduled process will therefore re-create these products every day automatically (essentially just a change to the description).  Therefore the product will already be there.   In the mean time, all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue - we currently have most desks creating products weeks/months in advance.  This software change is scheduled for Friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month (February).

We have only 2 logged/taped phone calls to the HelpDesk when Portland office has called the HelpDesk  with regard to this issue. Clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap, but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo.  Dale does come in early specifically for any products Portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times (bad traffic) when he may be late.

14/1 	07:35 (CST) J Richter  called to approve products
	Products activated products within 2 minutes.

24/1 	07:34 (CST) J Richter called  to approve products
	07:45 (CST) Anna Gardiner approved products
	07:46 (CST) J Richter called to inquire on status
	07:48 (CST) HelpDesk rang J Richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems
	
Clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but EnronOnline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone.  We only seem to have 2 times that  the procedure has been used to the HelpDesk extent and not failed dramatically.

Changing the procedure for two days (assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods) when we are all working  to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems.  If we do not introduce this software change on Friday we should review this policy - I obviously have no problem with Tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway.

Subject:	Approval procedure for Pending Products

I would like to talk  with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products.  IT IS NOT WORKING!  The current procedure is for us to create the product and call Dale Neuner and let him know its out there.  If Dale is not in the office, or it is before or after normal work hours, the traders need to call the help desk, who in turn calls Amita in the London office who then approves the product.   The Portland office starts trading at 5:00 AM PPT.  In the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning.  This morning the traders had several daily products pending approval.  It took 45 minutes to get those products approved.  On daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour.  As a result, the trader missed most of the trading period.  OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY AND NEITHER ARE THE TRADERS.  

A solution was proposed in December, which I have attached below, to address this issue.  However, it only works in the ideal world.  It would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time.  That is not the reality.  By rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade.

I would like to propose an alternate solution.  We need a direct method for Tim Belden to have approval rights to approve existing products.  These are not new products, we trade them every day.  There is no reason Tim should not have a level of approval to, at the very least approve existing products.  Especially where the only change is the term.

Please call Tim Belden at 503-464-3820 or myself at 503-464-3836.  Look forward to hearing from you.

Enron's Portland Office is a few hours ahead of Houston.  There are times where Portland needs products approved and the Houston Product Control Group is not available.  As it is important that products get approved as soon as possible, a new process has been put in place .   

1.	PORTLAND Trader calls for Product Approval.
2.	Advise Dale Neuner asap (x3-9746).
3.	If Dale is not physically able to take call, please call Amita Gosalia (x830-3-6888).

Subject:	Product Activation for Portland Power

Mike -

Regarding our conversation re: support of Power trading, we propose the following:

1) Suggest to trading that they create all DRAFT products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day. I will always check for DRAFT products at the end of my day and Activate any that are in DRAFT. Just  FYI, Gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days (or weeks) in advance. I keep track of those and keep their products current in advance. It works very well.

2) I am usually at my desk no later than 7:30 a.m. each day. If trading creates a DRAFT product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the Call Center at 3-4357 and state the following:

THIS IS PORTLAND POWER TRADING AND I NEED A PRODUCT ACTIVATED ASAP. PLEASE CONTACT AMITA GOSALIA IN LONDON.

The Call Center will then contact Amita, who has the authority and responsibility for activating products. Amita has agreed to perform this function for Portland Power and will instruct her people at PCG-London to locate her immediately (in the event that she is away from her desk) when this message comes in from the Call Center.

Donna Greif in the Call Center has been appraised of this procedure and will roll it out to the responsible Call Center personnel.

I hope this solves the problem. Please feel free to offer any comments or call if any part of this process is unclear.

Dale

Louise,

I spoke with Ben and he and I are in agreement.  We would be prepared to take the Mitsubishis into the EA turbine portfolio at cost.  Because they are off-balance sheet and interest gets capitalized, we think it makes sense to take a quarterly reserve approximating the actual interest charges.  In the event a turbine is "flipped", East, West and South share in the total gain.  We could establish upfront a transfer price, say cost + $3MM, for transfers into a project.  With everyone sharing in the pain and the gain, we should be able to make the optimal decision for EA.  

If Brett is concerned about losing them, neither Ben nor I have anything that could definitively place these machines in the next month or two.  We both have projects, leads, etc. but nothing can get inked quickly.  However, it is probably in Enron's interest to have people looking for alternative uses while Brett is trying to firm up his deal.  In 3-4 months we should have a defintive plan for these machines-if we wait 2-3 months for Brett to continue, we may not have a definitive plan for 5-7 months.

Regards,

Chris

Subject:	EES/ENA Customer Split

Tim:

As we discussed, speaking on behalf of trading (not origination) our preferred approach to dividing the Western Region customer base into EES and ENA categories would be to "let the market decide."   Under this approach, EES would be free to contact any customer they wanted as we would.  The customers will elect if they want to do a transaction with EES or ENA..

That said, this approach is not meant to be an antagonistic one.  We would be focusing on larger accounts (generators and load) in excess of 1 MW who want to pre-schedule.  We will not be offering a burner-tip solution that includes our having load risk or paying transmission and distribution.  If customers want that, we will be forwarding the lead to EES, probably to Doug Condon.  We would expect EES to do the same thing.  I have worked with Doug Condon in the past.  Once management has blessed this approach, I will call Doug and clarify how we want the approach to work.  Let me know if you find out that he is the "right" contact person.

The beauty of this approach is that it is clean.  The negative is that customers might be contacted by more than one Enron employee.  I think that is OK, however, as there are good reasons for that.  Our two companies offer two distinct approaches.  We should be making customers aware of this fact when we explain possible solutions and let them decide what is best for them. 

Let me know if this approach is ultimately adopted.

Thanks

Chris

John,

In case you bump into Ken Lay...a few months ago he asked us to look at a 65MW peaker project in Utah (Don Sanders).  We passed on the investment.  We pursued a marketing deal.  Yesterday Mike Etringer closed a services deal where we deliver gas and market power.  First services deal in Utah.  Risk-Free $1-$3/MWh plus $0.02/MMBtu.

Louise,

Just a heads up on an opportunity you might hear about:

- NEPCO has an EPC contract with a small IPP for a 245MW combined cycle project in Goldendale, WA, adjacent to an aluminum smelter

- NEPCO brought an EECC turbine to the project as part of the EPC contract

- The developer's financing fell through 3 weeks ago (they attempted a highly structured muni-bond financing with tolls for marketers and the smelter)

- NEPCO has been paid several million $ for engineering services, but construction wont start until a big payment ($30MM+) is made April 18

- When the financing fell through they called the big generators to see who would step up - Reliant was the most agressive, but last week Reliant changed their bid - instead of paying up-front they will pay at COD subject to high delay damages

- The developer appears to be in a bad box 

- NEPCO called us last week - the developer would like Enron to provide construction financing

- I sent in a SWAT team to check out the project

- In general, we like it, but I am not interested in lending $ to other people, so I am figuring out if we could just buy it.  It is approx $200MM to construct but its early time to market may make it economic

Three things could happen here:
1) Someone else buys it and NEPCO continues with their EPC contract

2) Enron buys the project from the developer, constructs and flips

3) Project dies altogether - in this case we want to make sure ENA gets the turbine - Janet and I wanted it last year; now Duran, Jacoby and I still want it.


I will keep you posted.

Regards,

Chris

According to Allegheny, this deal was closed this morning at 6am.

I was incorrect.  The existing non-recourse debt for Las Vegas ($55MM) is off-balance sheet and off-credit.  It does not show up as a liability on our balance sheet and it is not part of our footnotes.   If the plant blew up, we would be out $24MM, not $79MM.  We get this treatment because it is a fair market value asset and we have a Friend of Enron minority investor that keeps our stated interest below 50%.  Our interest for control purposes is over 50% because we have a call option on the Friend of Enron shares.

2)  EES's product is perceived to compete directly with SVP's core competen=
cy - provision of a fixed priced, load followed product.  SVP indicated tha=
t it currently offers term (up to 5 years), fixed priced, load followed pow=
er to its customers.  According to Wayne, over 100 MW's (20% of SVP's load)=
 is served this way.
3)  Ware opined that EES does not understand what SVP does or offers its cu=
stomers.  SVP was perplexed by this given that Wayne Truxillo (the EES rep.=
) worked for SVP and set up many of the fixed price programs that are curre=
ntly in place.
4)  SVP views EES's offering as a wholesale product.
5)  SVP also had concerns about EES's reputation and history in California =
citing the University of California fiasco.  SVP didn't think an EES produc=
t would be well received among its customers.

What is disturbing is that Mike and I asked both Truxillo and Ader if we co=
uld be included in these meetings or, at a minimum, be given the opportunit=
y to talk with our customers beforehand.  EES excluded us from this process=
.  Mike indicated that Ader was worried I would sabotage EES's efforts; tha=
t I would tell SVP that EES's proposal is a wholesale product replicating S=
VP's core competency of delivering a fixed priced, load followed product.  =
Mike and I had a somewhat heated discussion with Ader about their product o=
ffering.  Ader characterized the product as retail on the basis that it wou=
ld be sold one customer at a time and involved load following.  That the pr=
oduct is to be sleeved through SVP (actually sold to SVP for re-sale) and t=
herefore is a wholesale product was dismissed.  Ader also indicated that EE=
S would be offering behind the meter demand related services, which further=
 characterized their product as retail.  What is clear is that EES is searc=
hing for physical power sales.  They can offer behind the meter solutions w=
ithout the help or involvement of SVP.  Their product offering, once the de=

As was our concern, we will now have to manage this issue, reacting to EES'=

Ugh!!!

Louise,

I spoke to Chip and he mentioned your concern/question about the financing of this project.  To be clear, the turbines and some of the equipment are in Turbopark.  However, Global Finance does not want to construct this project inside of Turbopark because Accounting believes that would be problematic for our fair market value treatment of our merchant investments.  Global Finance's plan is to provide a JEDI II/ENA bridge loan to the project for the non-turbine construction costs through a bridge loan from May 1 through Sep 30.  The expected loan amount during this time period is $30MM, split between ENA and JEDI II.  Our economics assume the bridge loan is priced at 15%.  Global Finance has committed to arrange non-recourse project financing so that ENA/JEDI will have only a $40MM combined investment once the financing closes by Sep 30.  Also during this time period we will be actively marketing the project with the intent to divest of it fully prior to Sep 30.

Hopefully that clarifies things.

Regards,

Chris

I am repsonsible for Middle Market Coverage for West Power in Portland.   We spoke a week or so ago re: the ENA/EES customer split methodology.  I will be in Houston next Monday and Tuesday (April 9/10).  I would like to spend a half hour or so with you, if you had time, to brief you on what's going in the Middle Market Group in Portland, reviewing year to date earnings and a market share analysis we recently completed.  You may be getting some info. from Tim and/or internal reports, but I figured, since I was going to be in Houston, it would be a good chance to fill in some details. 

I had asked John Lavorato if he wanted to meet, but he indicated (see below) that it would be more appropriate to meet with you.  Tim B. also indicated I should try to meet you as well.   Let me know if you would like to meet and what time works for you.

We can definitely show them a firm, fixed price bid at SP-15.  They should be able to deliver into SP-15.  The issue is that we require huge credit for market LD's.  Duffy told Laura and Stew Rosman that the plant would have some free optionality from CFE so we thought that a services approach made sense.  

Our unit contingent fixed-price bid would be haircuted so much that it would not get done.

Laura and Stewart are prepared to show fixed-price term bids if that's what they want but I suspect that we will have a big credit /transfer price discussion - ultimately someone has to pay for the market LD's.

Don't know whether you have heard of the Mexico plant at Fapsa's paper company.  Potentially the project would need to export 10-15MW to you guys to make it viable.  I know they have been talking to Laura Wente in your group and got feedback that the best you can do is reasonable endeavours.

Is this at all viable on a firmer basis or viable at all?

Thanks

- Dave is incredibly valuable to our business.
- He lives in the most expensive city in the country.
- He has made Enron $90MM, most of which could not have closed if he lived in Houston or Portland.
- He is sitting on (like the rest of us) a lot of out of the money calls.

I think the following is appropriate:

Base: $200 + $15 COLA
Signing: $100
Equity: $300 (50/50)

Is there any possibility of negotiating a way out of the Mitsubishi contracts by paying them a fee.  I know we have no cancellation charge but can we just say we will pay them $10mm to cancel the contracts?  If we could do we want to do this?  

How much money would we lose (how much of a write down would we take) if I told you I wanted to get rid of the turbines by the end of September?  

As an aside, the Mitsubishis will be leaving the Enron Americas Balance Sheet now and moving to EGAS.  This does not and should not however change anything in terms of how we are moving forward.  For the company overall, we need to move these turbines (as with all the others) as soon as possible and we (in the Americas) are in a much better position than EGAS is to move them.  I have spoken to Jim on this issue who is obviously in agreement with the way forward.

fyi "done" means that I talked with Forster about the industrial split and sent him the Lavo/Delainey memo.  I did not talk to him about the gray areas re utilities, generators, etc. - my understanding is that that is not resolved/clear.

I like Wind.

I have two people pursuing opportunities.  Elliot Mainzer and Scott Healy.  Elliot managed our structuring group and has been interested in renewables for some time so Tim and I pushed him out of his nest and gave him a mandate to start a renewables desk.  His vision is to make a market for green power and start a renewables power exchange ("RPX") on EOL.  Scott is a generalist originator but developed wind projects prior to joining Enron so I have pulled him in to work with Elliot.

In this high-priced market, Wind is economic.  Wind development is able to come online quicker than nat gas.  The challenges are related to firming, or at least being able to pre-schedule the energy.  BPA, Pacificorp and LADWP have expressed interest in taking intermittent wind energy and redelivering it to a market point with a weekly pre-schedule.  They charge approximately $10/MWh for this service.  Given the value of supply, we are trying to buy energy or partner in development.  Current supply initiatives:

- Executed MOU with Enexco/Cinergy for joint development - non-binding, EPMI markets, Enexco builds and operates; Cinergy provides equity
- Proposed to Pacificorp purchase of 50MW block from their Stateline project 
- Proposed to ENE Wind purchase of energy from four of their CA projects
- Proposed to ENE Wind the purchase of one of their PNW sites
- Discussions with Morongo Tribe re joint CA development

Demand is coming from municipal and investor utilities, BPA, DWR, select Fortune 50 industrials with green portfolio requirements.  BPA put out an RFP for 1000MW.  We are meeting with municipal utilities to promote the concept of the RPX and to get some notional long-term bids.

This has all heated up in the last two months, but I like the fundamentals and I think we will have a small, profitable new business by the end of the year.

Chris

We received two financing commitment letters from Hancock.  In general, the letters are good and suggest that Hancock is genuinely in the deal, but they include some flakey language about not having final committee approvals.  Chip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get Hancock to call Ben Glisan to assure us that they are in (Hancock wants a lot of future business from Enron).  In the meantime, we are innovatively stalling GE by requiring some consent language up front so we get another day from them.  I think we will get both sides of this trade done.

*	ENE has underperformed its peer group of Energy Merchants.  Stock
price down 39% from 52-week high ($90 on August 23) vs. peer group, up 1.9%.
*	We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock, and believe the weakness
is largely due to concern over ENE's group-high P/E multiple and PEG ratio
of 27x and 1.3x, respectively (group average 19x and 1.0x), coupled with a
series of concerns over various parts of Enron's business: bandwidth, India,
etc.
*	Our sense is that the bandwidth unit is performing on target, and is
likely to beat the strong numbers posted last quarter.  India, while a
significant issue, remains a small part of Enron's asset base (about 4%).
It is a legacy business, in our view, and does not materially affect our
overall view of the company.
*	We see ENE's business fundamentals intact, and in fact, improving.
Growth rate expansion to 25% from 20%; growing returns on capital; bandwidth
trading all good reasons to own stock -- justify premium valuation.

Calpine reduced their purchase price because the turbine contract for Pastoria was overpriced by $9.9MM, the amount of the Catalytica credit.  

A brief confusing history as I understand it...ENA East and West jointly owned the Catalytica equity account in 1999.  It was written up based on expectations of an IPO value.  At 12/99 it transferred to West Power because Catalytica entered into an agreement with Pastoria to provide the Project with its Zonon technology.  This agreement included a commitment from GE to do research/work in order to use the Catalytica technology on GE turbines.  The cost of this ($9.9MM) was added to the Pastoria turbine contract.  

In Feb 2000,  when I arrived in Portland, I had the Catalytica account transferred to the Portfolio because I thought it was overvalued with little synergies with ENA West Power.  In mid-2000 the agreement was restructured in order to "clean up" Catalytica so it could IPO.  At that time, Enron was credited back the $9.9MM from Catalytica and it was decided by Delainey that that amount should be split 2/3-Pastoria and 1/3Catalytica Equity, with the 2/3 going to ENA West Power upon the sale of Pastoria.  Pastoria did not get the full $9.9MM back because we benefited somewhat from favourable publicity and some interest savings.   

At this time, since there is no funds transfer, I believe it simply becomes an internal income transfer from the Merchant Portfolio to ENA West Power.

what happens under the Pastoria deal to the Catalytica credit - did it go to Calpine or are you using it in the other turbine purchases?

Louise,
 
Instead of sending us a 1-paragraph extension letter Wed night, Allegheny sent a one-sided 4-pager yesterday afternoon.
 
The tone of the letter was inappropriate (Las Vegas agreeing it was in default, but AESC being kind enough to give us a chance).  Also, the business points were overeaching and/or vague.
 
The team turned the draft last night to clarify the business points and tone.  Comments from Legal (commercial, litigation, finance), Finance, Credit, Orig.
 
Parquet spoke with Dan Gordon to share our major comments.  Gordon was non-commital but said that "sounds like we are pretty close".
 
Basic deal we have put in the letter:
 
- AESC believes they can terminate
- LVCII believes we have complied with tolling agreement
- Parties will work for 5 business days to execute Pledge agreement, Security agreement, Deed of Trust, Subordination and Non-Disturbance Agreement
- AESC gets subordinated lien on ground lease
- Ground lease has non-disturbance provisions (LVCI can not break lease for LVCII)
- AESC gets subordinated lien on LM6000 and Transformer contracts
- Natwest loan agreement gets prepaid
- AESC acknowledges that LVCII is in compliance with security provisions of tolling agreement if we complete the above
- Increase collateral threshold to $50MM for both parties in Master Power Agreement
- No additional margin calls made prior to December 31, 2001
- $16MM Margin call made July 31 is withdrawn
- AESC keeps the $160MM+ L/C in place to cover existing exposure
- Enron Corp guarantess EPMI for $60MM
 
We are waiting to hear back from Allegheny.  Plan is to have both teams with legal and commercial have conf call to review document today. 
 
DASH has been circulated to the group for comment and will be finalized today.
 
Parquet is reviewing all of their previous comments on the security agreements so we are prepared to dig inot them over the next 5 business days if we get this letter executed.
 
Finance is preparing necessary documentation to execute plan.
 
Parquet is in his office and is obviously available to discuss - 415-782-7820.
 
I am around and will participate when our next meeting is scheduled.
 
Regards,
 
Chris

We are not done.  On Friday when we were prepared to sign, Black Hills Energy Capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent, Black Hills Corp.  At noon today they said that the signature was on its way.  At 4:00PM we heard that they will issue a L/C instead of the Corp guarantee.  The L/C approach is fine, but I am concerned with this flaky behavior.

Our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with Black Hills Energy Capital tonight/tomorrow morning.  They would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an L/C for $15MM by Thursday.  If not, we can terminate at any time prior to close of business Monday.  I will update when something changes.

Louise,

If you can wait a week or so, we can have the first of a regularly-scheduled update/report.   

Accounting (Jody Pierce) is getting the book set up consistent with the memo.  The contracts have been copied up to Portland and SF.  In a week or so, we will have a report that shows balance and some qualitative metrics, i.e. who we are talking with, indicative bids, project opportunities, etc.  For example, we included the Mitsubishis in the Roseville permit application which is being filed on July 31.  We are passing on the PGE turbine for now - they seem content to try to sell on their own.

Regards,

With the shipment of two of the four units from MHI scheduled for August and no viable place to ship them, our exposure to increasing costs associated with these units will start to climb quickly.  We need to move agressively to minimize our risk in this position.

Based on discussion with a number of people, I would strongly recommend that we make full efforts to sell units 1 and 2 as quickly as possible.  John Garrison has identified a number of potential buyers, and I believe that Brett Wiggs in in communication with one or more of them as we speak.

We should inform MHI that we will now target unit 3 for Fort Pierce, given the slowdown in the Fort Pierce schedule and the inability to get further reductions in pricing from MHI on unit 1.  If we also drop the dual fuel requirement for Fort Pierce, we should provide some project savings to that project.  Prior to informing MHI, we shoud have Jackson Chaeng status the auxiliaries for unit 3 so we have a basis for understanding any appropriate cancellation costs.

I also recommend that we tentatively target unit 4 for Tallahassee, unless sale of units 1 and 2 were contingent on delivering a 3rd unit to a buyer.  In the next three weeks we will review Tallahassee versus best turbine fit and availability of alternative equipment to determine if we want to continue to target unit 4 to that project.

Finally, MHI has requested that we allow an extention of ship date for unit 1 from August 2 to the end of August.  I think it is in our best interests to agree to that directly, given that we can't tell them where to ship it and would immediately face claims for storage costs if we insist on an August 2 ship date.  We should ask that they forgo storage costs on auxiliaries until the later ship date.

Probably everyone knows some of this, and some know all of this, but hopefully the overall picture is of value.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman

FYI - some of this CTC negotiation has been taking place with Dasovich and Tribolet.  I think the clean commercial deal for Ken to mention to Bryson is a 2-3 yr gas swap (they are short socal border and malin because some of their qf contracts are indexed to nat gas).

Subject:	Thoughts on PX Credit Claim with Edison

Chris:
A little background (recaps briefly what we discussed on the phone on Monday):
A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

Mike Mcdonald and Laird Dyer are looking at other creditworthy California shorts.  Some of munis (Roseville, Palo Alto) are trying to combine the long term purchase with a muni bond issue in order to prepay for the power.  The basic structure is that they borrow money from the tax-exempt market (6%), give the proceeds to the power supplier (who values the money at 7%++) and they effectively get cheaper power.   

We have done these deals in the past with nat gas.  Besides the margin on the commodity, we get cash in the door against an obligation to deliver.  Given our overall cash targets and CA length, I have made this a priority.  Mike Mcdonald has been selling the concept during the past six months. 

We are looking at submitting a notional offer later this week for Roseville (50MW-100MW, NP-15, 8-10 Years).  The big valuation question relates to ENA's bid for $.  Generally, we have paid over our cost of funds for this cash because it does not show up as debt.   In my discussions with Joe, he thinks our $ bid should be based on alternative markets for off-balance sheet cash, which might mean LIBOR plus 50-150 bp.   This sounds reasonable until I think of the fact that I am being charged 15% for balance sheet funds.  The bid/offer for balance sheet cash should not be 7%X15%.   

If I am using $100MM of balance sheet exposure and I can bring in $100MM of cash, shouldn't I be able to net out the difference?  

Any thoughts?

Regards,

Chris

Great news on the $ - cash is king.

Our toll on the other hand has been painful.  As of this morning, the remaining business issues were limited to the following:

Gross Negligence:  We have been unwilling to say that if the plant operator is grossly negligent, we will compensate them for their market damages.  In general, legal says that the law is vague and Haedicke does not want to set a precedent on these types of deals.  Basically, we have said if the plant is not available Allegheny reduces the capacity payment pro-rata.   The example used is:  The operator has a pick-up baseball game in the plant yard - foul ball is hit into the generator - plant goes down for a month - we say sorry, dont pay us this month - Allegheny says pay ld's.  We both agree that it is not gross negligence if the operator drops a wrench and the plant goes down for a month - Allegheny wants a bigger penalty so we proposed a larger discount in the capacity payment.      

L/C - In the event we portfolio finance, they want a $25MM L/C to cover willful breach, gross negligence, etc.  They want it from a AA Bank with $2Billion of Net Worth, we want flexibility with A and smaller net worth - not a dealbreaker.

Qualified Entity: We want the right to assign the equity without their consent to certain qualified entities (large power companies).  We want to be able to sell to a company with min net worth of $200MM, 500MW of operations and at least one 150MW+ sized plant.  Allegheny wants a tougher standard - not a dealbeaker

Loan agreements:  They want copies of the loan agreements that would finance this asset - no.

All of this is very manageable and should be executable tonight.  However, each day this week we have been in this position and they have re-introduced new issues/comments which have resulted in negotiations till 4:00 - 5:00 AM.

One additional delay is that we just received very detailed comments from Finance.  We are going through them right now with Brian Kerrigan.

Overall, I think we will get there, but it may not be until next week.  

Chris

The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission m=
eeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence g=
athered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:

Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will requ=
ire sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  Al=
l California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, w=
ill be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of t=
heir use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric faciliti=
es will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr)=20

Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price =
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in t=
he ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a partici=
pating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid=
 its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas=
 costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be the avera=
ge daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are t=
o be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and emissions will be pub=
lished the day after, for use on the following day.  A single market cleari=
ng price is determined in real time for all generators.  Highest bid sets t=
he clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the IS=
O, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating uni=
t.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each gene=
rator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event a generator=
 submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 da=
ys of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying=
 its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs in real =
time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to justify =
bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no oppo=
rtunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.

Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entiti=
es must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be=
 curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.=
  (24-7) =20

Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced=
 outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC.=
=20

Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.

RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June =
1 or Order lapses with no further effect.

ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how=
 things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are d=
ue in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.

Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based ra=
te authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withh=
old of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate b=
idding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the =
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit=
 behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be =
inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited (=
i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).

Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  Ref=
und conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a co=
ntrol area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when =
this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be just=
ified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell c=
ontractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within =
WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  Comme=
nts are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective dat=
e is 60 days from publication of the Order.

Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit =
is prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fine=
s does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as pa=
rt of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generat=
ion would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining pr=
ice. =20

Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) wheth=
er FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an esc=
row account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have o=
n the PG&E bankruptcy filing. =20

No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from Cal=
ifornia.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of the=
 foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will ke=
ep you posted.

 We are introducing functionality which will allow token reference periods for balance of month products, the scheduled process will therefore re-create these products every day automatically (essentially just a change to the description).  Therefore the product will already be there.   In the mean time, all of the other desks have been creating their products ahead of time to deal with this issue - we currently have most desks creating products weeks/months in advance.  This software change is scheduled for Friday to prevent traders from going through this issue next month (February).

We have only 2 logged/taped phone calls to the HelpDesk when Portland office has called the HelpDesk  with regard to this issue. Clearly in the second case we see a 9 minute gap, but this appears to be a single incident and not really something of the level of significance specified in your memo.  Dale does come in early specifically for any products Portland did not create the day before but obviously there can be times (bad traffic) when he may be late.

14/1 	07:35 (CST) J Richter  called to approve products
	Products activated products within 2 minutes.

24/1 	07:34 (CST) J Richter called  to approve products
	07:45 (CST) Anna Gardiner approved products
	07:46 (CST) J Richter called to inquire on status
	07:48 (CST) HelpDesk rang J Richter back to check that he had seen approval and had no technical problems
	
Clearly we are not intentionally trying to create a problem but EnronOnline is a new product and everyone is putting an immense amount of effort into getting the product up and running and helping everyone.  We only seem to have 2 times that  the procedure has been used to the HelpDesk extent and not failed dramatically.

Changing the procedure for two days (assuming succesful implementation of the tokenized reference periods) when we are all working  to keep the system up and running and keep all customers informed of developments may create more problems.  If we do not introduce this software change on Friday we should review this policy - I obviously have no problem with Tim approving such products as we will be moving to that level of authority shortly anyway.

Subject:	Approval procedure for Pending Products

I would like to talk  with you concerning our current procedure for daily approval of newly created products.  IT IS NOT WORKING!  The current procedure is for us to create the product and call Dale Neuner and let him know its out there.  If Dale is not in the office, or it is before or after normal work hours, the traders need to call the help desk, who in turn calls Amita in the London office who then approves the product.   The Portland office starts trading at 5:00 AM PPT.  In the event a product is not created ahead of time they create the product in the morning.  This morning the traders had several daily products pending approval.  It took 45 minutes to get those products approved.  On daily products the trading period may last only 1 hour.  As a result, the trader missed most of the trading period.  OUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT HAPPY AND NEITHER ARE THE TRADERS.  

A solution was proposed in December, which I have attached below, to address this issue.  However, it only works in the ideal world.  It would be overly optimistic to think that we are going to be able to always be able to create our products ahead of time.  That is not the reality.  By rolling out our products we have created an implicate contract with our customers that we will consistently make markets in the products we trade.

I would like to propose an alternate solution.  We need a direct method for Tim Belden to have approval rights to approve existing products.  These are not new products, we trade them every day.  There is no reason Tim should not have a level of approval to, at the very least approve existing products.  Especially where the only change is the term.

Please call Tim Belden at 503-464-3820 or myself at 503-464-3836.  Look forward to hearing from you.

Mike Etringer

Enron's Portland Office is a few hours ahead of Houston.  There are times where Portland needs products approved and the Houston Product Control Group is not available.  As it is important that products get approved as soon as possible, a new process has been put in place .   

1.	PORTLAND Trader calls for Product Approval.
2.	Advise Dale Neuner asap (x3-9746).
3.	If Dale is not physically able to take call, please call Amita Gosalia (x830-3-6888).
4.	Should Amita not be available, please advise PCG member that Portland
	need a product(s) approved.
5.	PCG member will find Amita, and get product approved asap.

Note:  Please be sure to assign the Remedy ticket to the appropriate group.

If you have any questions regarding this new procedure, please advise!

Thanks,

Subject:	Product Activation for Portland Power

Mike -

Regarding our conversation re: support of Power trading, we propose the following:

1) Suggest to trading that they create all DRAFT products that they will need for the next business day at the end of their day. I will always check for DRAFT products at the end of my day and Activate any that are in DRAFT. Just  FYI, Gas trading has adopted the practice of creating their products a couple of days (or weeks) in advance. I keep track of those and keep their products current in advance. It works very well.

2) I am usually at my desk no later than 7:30 a.m. each day. If trading creates a DRAFT product that they need activated prior to that time they should contact the Call Center at 3-4357 and state the following:

THIS IS PORTLAND POWER TRADING AND I NEED A PRODUCT ACTIVATED ASAP. PLEASE CONTACT AMITA GOSALIA IN LONDON.

The Call Center will then contact Amita, who has the authority and responsibility for activating products. Amita has agreed to perform this function for Portland Power and will instruct her people at PCG-London to locate her immediately (in the event that she is away from her desk) when this message comes in from the Call Center.

Donna Greif in the Call Center has been appraised of this procedure and will roll it out to the responsible Call Center personnel.

I hope this solves the problem. Please feel free to offer any comments or call if any part of this process is unclear.

Dale

Allegheny told us that we may be in default of the tolling agreement.  As part of that agreement, we had an obligation to deliver security agreements by July 31.  We have fulfilled that obligation but now Allegheny is saying that they are not in the appropriate form.  Legal believes that they do not have any basis for this claim.  Nevertheless this is a major problem given the exposure - we have commited to construct the project and to sell the project.  I do not know if they are negotiating hard or trying to blow up the deal.  We will likely need your time on this matter and we may need to respond quickly - possible fixes include modifying the ground lease in a way that would require us to take out the project lender on LVI.

Sorry for the delay...


Las Vegas:
Signed up.  Only condition is HSR.  The team is putting together a transition plan to deal with communications,  ongoing development, bank interfaces and closing schedules.  

Saguaro:
Submitted non-binding low bid last week to acquire Mission's 50% interest.  Waiting for Jeff Donahue to work out the engagement letter with CSFB for the more likely scenario (selling our 15% interest).  I spoke with him Friday and he was going to deal with it today.  (This episode was pretty silly - after Andy requested his group's involvement I sent Andy a draft, then sent drafts to Donohue, Metts, Glisan, then called Donahue, Metts, Miller, etc.)

Longview:
Finalized info memorandum - will send out to market later this week.  McCook still interested but slow.  Development is going well but slower than expected.  Viable EPC Contractor is Modern Continental - Karen Barbour from RAC and Jake Thomas visited them in Boston and gained some new respect for their people, experience, approach, credit, etc.  We will likely need a DASH for late July to put deposits down on additional equipment.  I still see this as a Q4 $15MM deal without taking any construction risk.

Munis: 
Mcdonald did a small term deal in NP15 - interestingly it was an index deal through the muni (Shasta) to an industrial (Kanauf) with whom we executed a financial swap - orig approx $400M.

Renewables: 
Air Force deal was booked to Foster because a mid-marketer worked with Elliot to close the deal and also some of the credits we sold had been banked by Foster from last year.   This is OK with me as long as all of the other wind stuff gets properly credited to orig (anything with ENE Wind, Cinergy, enXco, Pacificorp, Montana, putting a site to munis, etc.).  No need to referee!

AMPS: We pulled the plug on the Oregon site.  We are about to do the same with the Utah site.  Will continue to support Brett if he needs it.

Montana: another meeting went well - we are hiring bond and tax counsel to work on the structure.  Still looks like a $500MM prepay tied to a portfolio of assets and contracts.  Their bid is $40 escalated at cpi for 500MW 7X24 for 10 years starting 7/1/02.  Montana should trade at a discount to Mid-C so this is transactable if we can make the stars line up.   At their request, we are responding to a Montana Power RFP for renewables (Enron Wind has two sites and we are partnering with them in a RFP response).

This piece from Deutsche Bank is good macro overview of electricity supply / demand fundamentals.  A little on the long side - 78 pages, but has some good discussion on NERC (North American Electric Reliability Council Regions), beginning on page 15.

During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we=
 are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor buil=
d out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concern=
s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu=
cing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these conc=
erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu=
res without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to tal=
k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing=
 certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college re=
cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire. =
 We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple=
 of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p=
resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading=
 schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass=
 and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are unc=
ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon=
g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north=
west.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo=
st schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have a=
lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  =
The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit =
that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa=
rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it=
 is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our be=
lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=
 of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to empha=
size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will i=
nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba=
sed on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider t=
he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e=
mployees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we=
 don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro=
n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread=
y here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor=
e certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we =
still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo=
r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o=
n this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela=
ying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final arch=
itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo=
re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives th=
e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move=
.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=
 sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n=
ow.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje=
ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=
 right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w=
ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o=
r delay again. =20

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, rel=
iable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard=
 time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep=
 up the success of this office.

I am just tracking down the third 7FA you previously had outlined for Pastoria expansion.  As I understand this it went (as an option) in the sale to Calpine.  However in all the turbine reports it shows up as a firm commitment that ENA holds.  Which one is right - is it gone or do we still have it?

We are not done.  On Friday when we were prepared to sign, Black Hills Energy Capital said they needed until today to get a signature from their parent, Black Hills Corp.  At noon today they said that the signature was on its way.  At 4:00PM we heard that they will issue a L/C instead of the Corp guarantee.  The L/C approach is fine, but I am concerned with this flaky behavior.

Our plan is to sign the purchase and sale with Black Hills Energy Capital tonight/tomorrow morning.  They would have the obligation to deliver either a gurantee or an L/C for $15MM by Thursday.  If not, we can terminate at any time prior to close of business Monday.  I will update when something changes.

Louise,

Chris Calger mentioned that you had some questions regarding Fort Pierce and restrictions on their ability to assume liability by virtue of their status as a municipality.  I don't know if I've charactrized this correctly, but I've never heard of such a restriction, although it may be a Florida law provision I've never come across.  If I can be of any help running this to ground please let me know.  

Mike

Louise:

Tim Belden forwarded to me the files shown below for "soft targets for Q1."  It appears these reports are to track Middle Market transactions company wide.  However, the data does not match our records.  Attached is a recent report indicating Portland Middle Market year to date earnings of about $27 million and 163 transactions.  We also have the Services Desk here in Portland run by Greg Wolfe that is up an additional $3 million or so year to date. Can you give me the name of an individual who is involved with the reports below so I can contact them and figure out why our numbers differ from those in the reports below? 


Thanks!

Chris

Mike signed on Friday which is great news.  Richter, Heizenrader, and I are all waiting on language that gets us comfortable with the California litigation risk.  In case you were wondering, we are not talking to one another about this language.  Each person is working independently on this.  We have been waiting on Michele Cash for a week now on proposed language (and for me, a copy of Enron's corporate bylaws explaining officer indemnification).  I will keep you posted.

Mike stole my thunder!  The team did a great job - now we need to manage construction and sell it QIII.  We have one party (Northland Power) that is bid the equivalent of a $25MM promote.  We are showing it to others.  I will keep you posted.

Subject:	Re: How is our Allegheny deal?   

Great news on the $ - cash is king.

Our toll on the other hand has been painful.  As of this morning, the remaining business issues were limited to the following:

Gross Negligence:  We have been unwilling to say that if the plant operator is grossly negligent, we will compensate them for their market damages.  In general, legal says that the law is vague and Haedicke does not want to set a precedent on these types of deals.  Basically, we have said if the plant is not available Allegheny reduces the capacity payment pro-rata.   The example used is:  The operator has a pick-up baseball game in the plant yard - foul ball is hit into the generator - plant goes down for a month - we say sorry, dont pay us this month - Allegheny says pay ld's.  We both agree that it is not gross negligence if the operator drops a wrench and the plant goes down for a month - Allegheny wants a bigger penalty so we proposed a larger discount in the capacity payment.      

L/C - In the event we portfolio finance, they want a $25MM L/C to cover willful breach, gross negligence, etc.  They want it from a AA Bank with $2Billion of Net Worth, we want flexibility with A and smaller net worth - not a dealbreaker.

Qualified Entity: We want the right to assign the equity without their consent to certain qualified entities (large power companies).  We want to be able to sell to a company with min net worth of $200MM, 500MW of operations and at least one 150MW+ sized plant.  Allegheny wants a tougher standard - not a dealbeaker

Loan agreements:  They want copies of the loan agreements that would finance this asset - no.

All of this is very manageable and should be executable tonight.  However, each day this week we have been in this position and they have re-introduced new issues/comments which have resulted in negotiations till 4:00 - 5:00 AM.

One additional delay is that we just received very detailed comments from Finance.  We are going through them right now with Brian Kerrigan.

Overall, I think we will get there, but it may not be until next week.  

Chris

On our two quotes, my comment on the first quote is important; the second might sound a little better but says the same thing.  

The Pastoria Energy Center represents the second major power project developed in California by Enron since 1999, ...

Enron remains committed to helping meet the growing need for reliable and affordable electricity in California through the development of other highly efficient projects.

My only comment is that the project is referred to Pastoria Energy Facility and Pastoria Energy Center.  The name of the LLC is Pastoria Energy Facility LLC.  Calpine's wholly-owned sub, Pasotia Energy Center LLC, will be purchasing 100% of ENA's membership interest in Pastoria Energy Facility.

Per Chip's note, this is still s/t change.  The DASH is drafted to allow for approval subject to Delta signing and Hancock providing a financing commitment letter.  Neither of those have occured, but are expected to occur today.

Louise,

I enjoyed meeting you this week and appreciate your taking the time.  The discussion with RAC on the Roseville DASH went well and hopefully it will hit your desk within two weeks.  In the meantime, we're submitting an IDASH so that we can secure options on some of the Emission Credits we'll need for the project.

Thanks again,

Mike

Re-sending with minor changes to the prior documents.  A clean copy is now provided.

Lance Schuler advised me that it is now Jeff Donahue, rather than Mark Metz, that needs to sign off on Corp's behalf, and that either Tim Detmering, Louise Kitchen or John Lavorato can approve on behalf of ENA.

 << File: 092701 ABB Power T&D Co. Inc. Confid Agr-No Separate Agreement.doc >>  << File: 092701 ABB Power T&D Co. Inc. Confid Agr-No Separate Agreement-Clean.doc >> 

A redraft of the ABB confidentiality/exclusive dealings agreement is attached for review and comment.

This document is based on the form ABB provided and for which ABB has expressed a strong preference.  

This draft calls for bilateral exclusivity for the Term (2 years).  As several of us have discussed, this will prevent ENA from choosing an alternative technology or supplier during that time should it choose to construct a DC transmission line within a 15-mile radius of San Francisco.  As I understand it, we are prepared to link arms with ABB to do this project because ABB is the premier supplier of this type of equipment. 

Based on recent discussions between Wayne and ABB, the language necessary for creating the exclusivity arrangement has been added to the form of confidentiality agreement that we had been working on with ABB earlier.  The added language is somewhat lengthy, but was necessary to establish the relationship and at the same time protect ENA against arguments that we are obligated to proceed with the potential transaction.  

Because this transaction does commit ENA to exclusivity obligations I understand that we will need to talk with Tim Detmering and Mark Metz about the transaction.  

Please let me know of comments.

Subject:	Conversation with Edison re: Getting Negative CTC Paid

I talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:

They plan to "settle" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.
Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.
He said that they will propose to net it out in one of two ways:  1) lump sum netting (i.e., if they owe $50MM and the share of the undercollection is $30 MM, then they pay the ESP $20 MM; or 2) future reductions in PX Credit (i.e., they pay the ESP $50 MM, and then reduce the PX going forward until the $30 MM is paid down).  The numbers are illustrative only.
In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)
I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.
He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison "meet and confer" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.
Fielder is also the point person on "getting ESPs paid" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.
It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is a draft press release regarding the sale of the Pastoria Energy Center to Calpine.  I have added Enron to the headline and a quote from John Lavorato to the original Calpine release.

Since the deal signed on Friday and Calpine is already talking about the deal publicly (yet we didn't get their proposed release until now), please forward your comments to me as soon as possible.  I would like to get back to Calpine today (Monday, March 19) or first thing in the morning at the latest.  I am in Florida working on our power plants, but am online and can be reached at 888-809-7936 (pager) or 281-414-9669 (cell).

Thanks.

Eric

Mike,

Jeff Donahue said that ENE and CSFB are in general agreement and that we should proceed with CSFB as though the engagement letter is done (it wont actually get signed until after a 7/16 Fastow meeting).  If Bartlett or Stinebaugh resist any more, Jeff will call his counterpart.

Please forward this e-mail to other persons within your respective groups who may have access to the Tolling Agreement or whose responsibilities may cause them to deal with Las Vegas Cogeneration II, L.L.C.'s business operations.

Thanks.




As you may be aware, on Friday, May 4, 2001, Las Vegas Cogeneration II, L.L.C. ("LVC II") executed a Capacity and Ancillary Services Sale and Tolling Services Agreement ("Tolling Agreement") with Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC ("ALLEGHENY").  

LVC II is an affiliate of ENA and of JEDI II.

Due to the nature of the services to be performed under the Tolling Agreement, LVC II will have access to information, including pricing, dispatch information and outage schedules, that ALLEGHENY deems extremely sensitive.  Accordingly, the Tolling Agreement requires LVC II and ALLEGHENY to keep all information relating to the Tolling Agreement in strict confidence.  

ENA provides certain administrative services to LVC II pursuant to an Administrative Services Agreement.  Furthermore, as equity holders in LVC II, ENA and JEDI II have access to information from LVC II as a matter of course.

In the course of providing services to or on behalf of LVC II, or in connection with management of ENA's or JEDI II's equity positions in LVC II, you may obtain information regarding the Tolling Agreement and/or operational information regarding LVC II.  ALL SUCH INFORMATION MUST BE TREATED AS CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED INFORMATION, AND IS NOT TO BE DISCLOSED TO ANY PERSON OR USED FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN IN FURTHERANCE OF YOUR PROVISION OF SERVICES TO LVC II.

IN PARTICULAR, NO INFORMATION REGARDING THE TOLLING AGREEMENT OR ANY INFORMATION REGARDING THE OPERATIONS OF LVC II ARE TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OR DISCLOSED TO ANY PERSON INVOLVED IN THE POWER MARKETING OR TRADING OPERATIONS OF ANY ENRON AFFILIATE.

Under certain limited circumstances this information can be disclosed to third parties.  However, it is vital that you first confirm the appropriateness of making such disclosures with Dale Rasmussen, Karen Jones or Sheila Tweed of ENA's legal department prior to making any such disclosures.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Louise,

A DASH should hit your desk tomorrow.  We are requesting an additional $9MM to increase our exposure to $25MM.  This will cover us through 10/31 which should give us enough time to close the sale.  The exposure is as follows:

GE Gas Turbine:	$10.2MM
Alstom Steam		$7.0MM
Nooter/Eriksen HRSG:	$2.5MM
Engineering:		$2.2MM
Gas Interconnect:	$0.9MM
Soft Costs/IDC:		$2.7MM		

The development in general has gone very well.  We believe that the remaining development risk is low and manageable.  The info memorandum has lots of details.  The preliminary, non-binding, indicative notional bids are as follows:

NRG:		$25-$30MM
McCook:	$20MM
Calpine:		$18MM
PPL Global:	$15MM
AES:		$11MM
El Paso:	$10MM
Sempra:	$3MM

Williams and Allegheny showed us tolling bids.  Williams was below our desk mid ($5.50/kwmonth); Allegheny was not economic for our asset, but above our desk mid ($8.25/kwmonth).  We are countering to both with desk offers.

Nothing yet out of Duke or Dynegy, but they say they are working on it.  Everybody else is out (Mirant, Constellation, Entergy, FPL, PG&E, Orion, PSEG, Tractabel).

I am obviously available at your convenience to discuss.

Regards,

Chris Calger

Re-Regulation is Here; Cautious on Group; Much Risk Already in Stocks
*	As anticipated, FERC enacted electricity price controls yesterday
across the United States, west of the Rockies.
*	Controls only affect spot market (approx. 20% of total market), and
are set to expire on September 30, 2002
*	Details of controls suggest effect on earnings may be limited,
but...
*	We think the "skids have been greased" for further controls down the
road, as government regulators seek regulatory solutions to future market
imbalances
*	We are becoming more cautious on group, but maintain positive
ratings at this time given extent of recent pull-back and likely strong
2Q:01 earnings outlook
*	Refer you to our earlier note entitled, "Political Risk Worsens;
Expect FERC Decision Today" where we previewed the FERC decision and provide
further details of our analysis

After your and my conversation this am, our Legal team had meeting with Allegheny's.  

Meeting went well.  

Insurance still open, but we developed what should be a path to agt.  Other two major issues (remedies under default and legal venue) along with numerous minor issues were hopefully on way to being solved.  Docs to be exchanged again tonite. We'll see.

Since that meeting, new issue arose re letter agt.  It dealt with ensuring that the agts made by EPMI in ltr agt re collateral were final once Allegheny gave us notice that they were OK with Security Agts.  Issue not substantive and we will agree to their change.  Trying to get date of ltr agt to be today.

Calgary is done.  Ben is done.  Brett was in agreement verbally and with the first draft (he did not say done on the final draft because he left town till July 12, but Ben and I believe he is done).

Will do on the update every couple of weeks

Shock, horror we ended up at $30mm!  

Seems fine by me.  I presume the guys in Calgary are all happy with this way forward.  

Thanks for getting this done.  I am assuming that we are now done on this.  Can we get a strategy update on all the turbines going forward once every couple of weeks?

Our structuring and risk groups have "entered" the executed CDWR contracts into Enpower.  We have included executed contracts but not letters of intent.  There were a few contracts that did not have sufficient information to model.  We believe that we have captured 80 percent to 90 percent of value.  The attached spreadsheet shows the results by company.  The data comes directly from information released by the California state treasurer.  Since we are using Enpower to calc these deals, we can update them easily.  Let me know if you want anything else on this.

Subject:	DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative "mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

We have another opportunity to sell to DWR.  I have been in discussions with Ray Hart of DWR and Ron Nichols, their consultant. We are closing in on a structure that has less upfront risk for Enron with a larger overall short position in the back.  They want to move to contract negotiations next week.  I would appreciate your input.  I will arrange a conference call with the legal and credit teams for Monday to review the status of our EEI contract and the requirements for this potential deal.

Louise,

Cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e-Next banks (turbopark).  The cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date.  We do not need balance sheet cash to continue, but we need to come up with B/S cash if we terminate.  Hopefully the following clarifies:

Cash Payments to Date: 
GE7FA		13,328
ST		909
HRSG		1480
Interest 	350
Total:		16,067

Next Payments:
GE7FA		1,566		Nov 21
ST		2,849		Dec 1
HRSG		2,960		Dec 1
These are estimates - the timing of the actual payments depends upon when the vendor completes some of the work - payment based on milestones

Cancellation Charges:
10/31:		$23MM
11/1:		$24MM
11/30:		$28.3MM
Each day from 11/1 to 11/30 the cancellation charge increases by approx $150K 
   
DASH is based on contractual exposure, not cash out the door, hence the request at this time.  In addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project, we are looking into the ST and HRSG contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach.

sorry missing the message

When are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as I am not prepared to write down a 23mm loss.

Payments and payment dates please.

Thanks

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility=
.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in la=
te June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's ti=
me to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success.=20

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. cl=
imb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain.=20

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.=
  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to yo=
ur schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland=
, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.   =20

Regards

John

I have not spoken with him, but spoke to John Gillis and several NEPCO people on the project.  I will follow up with Keith.  FYI I am thinking of submitting a non-binding proposal tomorrow to buy the project  (I am preparing a few slides for your review on the value proposition).

Louise,

Calpine, NRG, Reliant, and Enron have expressed interest.  Calpine has been in the lead, but that complicates NEPCO's (and Enron's via the CTG)  position as RAC has a moratorium on taking any Calpine risk. As of today, the leader is NRG based on their submission. There is a new permitting process in the Northwest that will significantly slow new projects. This project is already permitted and not subject to the slowdown.

 John Gillis attempted to call you last week to explain the details of the opportunity.  John has a relationship with the developer and  is ready to discuss at your convenience.  His phone is 425-415-3100.

Keith Dodson

Good question.  I think he has experience using other people's money to get asset deals done - worth asking.  Answer probably depends on a gut feel on how we answer the questions:

Is something changing that increases the number of potential counterparties?
Is something changing that increases the number of products/risks that we can intermediate?
If answer is yes - perhaps we just need more good mid-marketers.
If answer is no - maybe we need someone that can look at bigger regional issues - infrastructure, cross-border basis, etc. 

Have him based in Houston and go for it for 12 months.  If nothing materializes, it's a small investment for a large, neighboring country.

Before we spend any money, I'll pull together the market info to determine if there is enough residual value/liquidity data to support a story that the loan would be secured.

With regards to the existing deal, the setup costs and timeline was primarily the result of working out the kinks on legal/accounting structures to find a deal structure both sides could live with. I would hope costs would be lower on future additions. Having said that, though, the underlying inventory items would have to be evaluated by the lenders for residual value and liquidity. To the degree the underlying asset would support less than book value upon a quick liquidation, the put/call price protection embeds more enron risk in the financing. In the current environment, I am less than confident I could sell the unsecured enron piece shortly. Jim, can you stay point on this exercise for the ercs and other items. Thanks.

Just to add to Tim's note - I suggest that the number of overlap issues wou=
ld be few and far between and can be resolved at the operating level.  I th=
ink ENA can offer up representatives from each region that have an open lin=
e of communication with the appropriate EES people.  If ENA and EES provide=
d each other with a short list of contacts there should be no need to deal =
with this at the OTC level.  For example, Chris Foster (ENA West Power Mid =
Market) would direct  questions/opportunities to EES and field calls from E=
ES people looking at deals in the western power market.

ENA Interface List:

Power:
West:  Foster
Midwest: Baughman
East: Pagan
Texas: Sukaly

Gas:
West: Tycholiz
Midwest: Luce
East: Vickers
Texas: Martin

Dave knows all of these people and I believe that they do things in the bes=
t interest of "One-Enron".

i heard dave's voicemail.  i appreciate his concern.  however, i don't thin=

Bascially, we will need to spend another $7.5 million on 11/30 to keep the equipment orders alive.

The spreadsheet below may help.

The line "Incremental Cash Spend" is what Enron will need to pay at the end of each November and December.  The line "Cancellation + E-Next Interest" is Enron's cancellation exposure (binding commitment to the equipment vendors and E-Next) to the extent we cancel on those dates.

Louise,

Cancellation charges have been the focus because the cash is provided by e-Next banks (turbopark).  The cash paid to date is less than the actual contractual obligation to date.  We do not need balance sheet cash to continue, but we need to come up with B/S cash if we terminate.  Hopefully the following clarifies:

Cash Payments to Date: 
GE7FA		13,328
ST		909
HRSG		1480
Interest 	350
Total:		16,067

Next Payments:
GE7FA		1,566		Nov 21
ST		  2,849		Dec 1
HRSG		2,960		Dec 1
These are estimates - the timing of the actual payments depends upon when the vendor completes some of the work - payment based on milestones

Cancellation Charges:
10/31:		$23MM
11/1:		$24MM
11/30:		$28.3MM
Each day from 11/1 to 11/30 the cancellation charge increases by approx $150K 
   
DASH is based on contractual exposure, not cash out the door, hence the request at this time.  In addition to looking for opportunities to sell the equipment and the project, we are looking into the ST and HRSG contracts to make sure the vendors are not in any sort of breach.

sorry missing the message

When are the payments and how much are they if we keep moving forward as I am not prepared to write down a 23mm loss.

Payments and payment dates please.

Louise:

A termination of equipment associated with the Longview project on or before 10/31/01 will require Enron to write-off approximately $23 million, not inclusive of approximately $3 million in development costs to date.
To extend orders for equipment to 11/30/01 will cost an additional $5.3 million in cancellation charges.
To extend orders for equipment to 12/31/01 will cost an additional $8.7 million (inclusive of the $5.3 million above, therefore, net $3.4 million) in cancellation charges.

Termination at any time between now and year-end 2001 provides no material recovery potential for money spent.

I am trying to close the bid/offer spread.  One thought on your plan below: If Ben and I own the ABB's at 29MM-30MM, we will try to sell them at 31-35.  That will create noise in the market for Canada's deals which will get re-priced down.   Likewise, if Ben and I own them, we can not be prevented from offering them below Canada's deals.  

Solution:   Transfer the turbines 9/1/01 at a price that we agree to today.

Hello, 

As I didn't hear anything last week on whether we had made progress on the transfer/sale of the ABB turbines (I know Ben was out too ) I thought I would put my thoughts in writing.  I am assuming that we are all on board with the fact that transferring these assets to the Turbine Book is the most efficient mechanism for dealing with the turbines going forward - please let me know if anyone thinks otherwise (excluding arguments about transfer pricing).

Transfer ABB turbines to the Turbine Book (under the management of Jacoby and Calger), capital charges to be picked up by the Turbine Book as of 7/01/01.   The Turbine Book is responsible for the turbines going forward.

Should a sale occur (negotiated by ECC) to any of the customers outlined in the documents, ECC has the right to buy back the assets at any time at the transfer price plus capital charge incurred during the period when the turbines were owned by the Turbine Book.  The call option expires 9/01/01 and can only be exercised for a sale to the counterparties in the document attached with the addition of Calpine for the purposes of a sale combined with the site (the call option for a Calpine sale is valid until 12/01/01).  If  ECC does not wish to pursue the sale to the counterparties in the document attached, then Jacoby can pursue these negotiations and if a sale is completed this year with these counterparties, the Turbine Book will receive a brokerage fee ($1 million) and ECC will pick up capital costs between 7/01/01 and the completion of the sale. 

Please agree to a transfer price for these turbines, if a price cannot be agreed between you, please let me have your arguments substantiating your transfer price and I will arbitrate on the number on Friday.  Let me know if anyone disagrees with moving forward in this way.

Regards

Louise

FYI NRG is the winning bidder for Mission's Saguaro QF.  They are bid $21 for our 15% interest.  We have it marked at $19MM.  They commented on our PSA and we expect to turn a draft/meet with them next week.  Don Miller and Jeff Donahue are aware of this.

Subject:	Avoidable Overtime Hours

We have had 100 percent turnover in our risk group in the last 9 months, including two people leaving in the last week.  One of the main frustrations comes from many overtime hours spent working through technology issues.  

Last Friday is a typical example.  The three members of our risk group were here until about 10 PM Friday night working through a problem caused by Technology.  For some reason, our Futures position was dropping out of our positions.  They noticed this and stayed until it was fixed.  It turns out that a DBA somewhere made a change that caused the mapping of our Futures positions to change.  Had this person communicated to people what he/she was doing, it is my understanding that the problem could have been avoided.  Stated another way, lack of communication by someone in technology caused our risk group to work an extra 15 hours on Friday night.  I should add that one or more people in technology had to work extra on Friday as well.

It is so frustrating to see this sort of thing happen over and over.  The list of little things that cause lots of extra work is so long that it is not funny.  It kills morale and burns out smart, hard working people.  What do you think we can do to change this situation?

His asst. called to let you know he will be out of the office for the rest of the week.  His wife is in the hospital and has been for the last 2 1/2 weeks with pregnancy complications.  They are suppose to induce her(not sure exactly when) and she thought Chris might be back in the office on Monday.  He will be checking his voicemail and emails and will probably call in to the office a couple times a day.

I will be sure to send flowers when the baby arrives.

Louise,

Chip will want to talk with you about the Longview equipment.  We are circulating a DASH to enable us to continue making payments.  If we do not continue to make payments, we forfeit the equipment and take a $23MM hit.  This is approximately 35% of the total equipment contract.  I think the equipment is worth more (than 65%) and I believe that we will get out of this problem with less than a $22MM hit.  I therefore recommend that we commit the extra $ for this equipment.  It will continue to be funded off B/S.  

We continue to have discussions/negotiations with Calpine, NRG and TransAlta.  We have also opened up general equipment discussions with Mirant and AES.  

Regards,

Chris Calger

Louise,

This is incomplete with some bids expected next week.  A lot of companies had a late start due to the 4th of July holiday so they have been whining this week about an extension.  Bids are preliminary and based solely on the info memo.  Bids are in addition to all sunk costs:

McCook Metals - 	$20MM (this is an ongoing, slow negotiation)
PPL Global - 		$15MM
Reliant			$10MM


Indicated that they will submit bid later today/over weekend/early next week:
Calpine
Allegheny
AES
Sempra
Williams
El Paso
NRG
Dynegy

I expect some of these wont show up.


Out for various reasons:
Mirant
Constellation
Entergy
FPL
PG&E
Orion
PSEG
Tractabel


If we end up with 5-6 positive bids, even if they are non-binding, I think it supports risking additional capital to get this project fully developed/sold (DASH in process).  

One interesting note: Allegheny wants to see our offer.  If we have several reasonable bids ($10-$20), it might make sense to offer a high outlier.

I will update. 

Regards,

Chris Calger

Enron has two mobile units that are available for placement in customer deals or in pure merchant sites.  These are 22MW, trailer-mounted and are being refurbished/packaged for delivery QIII, 2001.  In general, these units will be high heat rate, high emissions, but are cheap and available.  

In order to streamline the process and facilitate information flow, I have asked Jim Buerkle to be responsible for placing these machines into income producing deals in the WSCC.  He will evaluate site alternatives, work with the Enron groups that control these machines and structure the commercial deals.  Please forward any opportunities to Jim.  If these units get placed profitably, we will likely step up to manufacture more units available for Summer 2002.

Regards, 

Chris

My, my, my.  Note that Allegheny's power is firm.  As we thought, that must be why we had so much fun with them on LV.  

Are Yoder and Hall checking for prices?  That would be the info to get.

The exposure goes up $3MM-$5MM per month up to the equipment contract cost of $67MM for an incremental DASH of approx $49MM (with interest).  Chip and I talked about approving the full amount, but checking monthly with you and him as to whether or not we want to continue payments.  An alternative is to DASH 2 more months now and formally evaluate our position at year-end.

Louise,

Chip will want to talk with you about the Longview equipment.  We are circulating a DASH to enable us to continue making payments.  If we do not continue to make payments, we forfeit the equipment and take a $23MM hit.  This is approximately 35% of the total equipment contract.  I think the equipment is worth more (than 65%) and I believe that we will get out of this problem with less than a $22MM hit.  I therefore recommend that we commit the extra $ for this equipment.  It will continue to be funded off B/S.  

We continue to have discussions/negotiations with Calpine, NRG and TransAlta.  We have also opened up general equipment discussions with Mirant and AES.  

Regards,

Chris Calger

We had a bad accident at the construction site on Friday.  A construction worker slipped and fell in front of a bulldozer.  Over the weekend he had his foot amputated.  We have flown his family in and put them up at a Ronald Mcdonald House (non-profit institution for families of injured/ill patients).  The worker was employed by a sub-contractor of CIG, the pipeline company that is constructing the gas lateral for Fountain Valley Power LLC.

NEPCO is making some noise because they want it to be clear that this was not a NEPCO subcontractor and therefore not NEPCO responsibility.   We do not think this will materially delay closing the sale to Black Hills, but we will likely need to indemnify them from the litigation risk associated with this accident.  We are working with legal and insurance to assess risk and process.  

Chris

Louise,

Calpine, NRG, Reliant, and Enron have expressed interest.  Calpine has been in the lead, but that complicates NEPCO's (and Enron's via the CTG)  position as RAC has a moratorium on taking any Calpine risk. As of today, the leader is NRG based on their submission. There is a new permitting process in the Northwest that will significantly slow new projects. This project is already permitted and not subject to the slowdown.

 John Gillis attempted to call you last week to explain the details of the opportunity.  John has a relationship with the developer and  is ready to discuss at your convenience.  His phone is 425-415-3100.

I understand financing fell through on this project and we have Chris Calger's group looking at the project - can you please keep me in the loop on the way forward on this project for NEPCO to ensure the best solution for Enron.

I called him at home last night.  His absence from the office this week was somewhat unplanned.  He is at home with his kids as his mother inlaw is taking a break for the week (remember, he has four kids, including a two-month old baby and his son Erik who has had a variety of health problems).  He is planning on coming in at the end of the week to interview some internal people for a job on the services desk.  I agree that it looks like he is out of here, but he gave me no indication.  I think that we should sit tight for a few days.  I will know when he's coming in to do the services interviews.  Perhaps Amy should have a conversation with him at that time.

louise,
no hi how are you doing?  no how is it going up there in portland?  you just come in and go right for the west desk's eol jugular.  

as everyone knows, the west power desk has a spotty record, at best, on maintaining eol volumes.  there are some good reasons for this and some lame, tired excuses which i'm sure we will discuss in great detail in the near future.

i currently don't get the ice reports and will make sure i am on the distribution.  from what our traders tell me and what the report that you sent indicates, ice is having an even harder time in the west than we are.  it looked like there were two one-month deals on ice that day totalling 20,000 MWh.  in contrast, we had 87 transactions totalling 269,000 mwh.  if i'm reading it right, the ice report actually makes us look good by comparison!

We look at ICE volume reports every day and they are doing about 10-20% of the volumes (and # transactions) we are doing on EOL.   We are doing 300-350 transactions per day in East Power and ICE does approx. 45-50 transactions per day.

That Antelope number was last month (before closing the books on Pastoria).  Tri-Valley is a development expense that is being expensed this quarter against Pastoria.  Sorry for the confusion.  I am waiting on accounting to provide a QI listing of my balance sheet details and related capital charges.  Once I have that, you should not have to deal with surprises/discrepencies.

Antelope showed up yesterday for the first time on the balance sheet with a charge (on which you will get a capital charge of 15%) of just over $10m.  You may want to talk to Wes.
 
Also - what is Tri Valley - its another  one under you at $1.2m

Antelope is a project that we acquired last year from AES.  The project has land, some early permits, and a transmission queue position that we used at Pastoria.  Total consideration paid to AES was approximately $15MM, most of which was charged to Pastoria.  The resulting cost basis should be about $1.8MM plus the ERC's not used at Pastoria (approx. $6MM).  Over the next 4 months we will determine whether we want to pursue the project or, if not, write off the $1.8MM and sell/transfer the ERC's for a gain of $1.8MM+.

Coyote Springs was a project that we developed and sold in 2000.  It was a 280MW 7FA that we co-developed with Portland General and sold pre-construction to Avista for a $18MM promote.  There should not be any balance sheet exposure associated with it- we are done.

Louise,

I spoke with Mark.  I believe he is getting a little more comfortable.  He is now focused appropriately on the likelihood of the bonds getting issued.  He is going to call around to some law firms and I will talk to some Bankers, just to get some other opinions.  I will have a short presentation for the meeting.

Cheers,

Chris

It might be easier (for the sake of time) to just take the DPR numbers and split it out be originator.

These are the aggregate numbers:

Foster			37,642,000
Wolfe			5,678,000
Thomas/Macdonald	5,188,000
Parquet			77,191,000
Calger			7,000,000

Thanks

Subject:	Originations Schedule

Hi Louise,

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

?	by team
?	by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
?	by Originator (sorted by value)
?	Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
?	Top 10 Originators- Gas
?	Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!
