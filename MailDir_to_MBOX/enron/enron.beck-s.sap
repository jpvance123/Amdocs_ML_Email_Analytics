Richard -

Attached is an outline of the involvement we've engaged AA to perform for 
each business unit as they go-live onto SAP.  Please remember that ENA is 
going live onto SAP's "common design" that has already been reviewed by AA 
from a internal controls perspective.  So this attachment outlines those 
items outside of "common design" that Wanda and Sally  probably want covered 
from an ENA perspective.  As a rule of thumb, this proposed scope equates to 
$100k - $150k in fees to AA that is over & above the audit budget.

One word of advice:  Designate a lead within ENA that has the time to stay on 
top of the project, schedule meetings with AA, and coordinate their 
involvement with the SAP team members, e.g. not Wanda or Sally, but at a 
director/manager level at least.  I was the designee for Corp and ensured 
that AA kept the project going.  Also, I worked extensively with the Janet 
Tran, SAP lead director responsible for bringing Corp up.  Some big benefits:
Kept AA out of SAP's hair when things got rough.
Made sure that the SAP team knew what our goals & objectives were, especially 
when we found something that needed fixed before go-live.
Managed that in fact AA provided us a deliverable at the end of the project.

Please review and call if you need other info.  I'd be glad to assist ENA 
too.  I assisted Europe (Naomi Connell) and Int'l cos (John Berggren).  They 
appreciated having a "co-pilot" and we avoided duplication of effort with 
what had already been done for the prior go-lives.  Also, they felt that 
value was rec'd for dollars paid to AA for this work.

The SAP Reporting Team is currently scheduling Reporting Workshops for August 
and September.  These will be very focused, hands on, sessions from 1-4 hours 
long with around 5 people per session.   There is one overview class, Design 
& Data Flow, which will not be hands on but which will give you an overview 
of how data flows in the systems.   Each class will focus on how to pull 
reports within the specific module listed and how to use the standard SAP 
reporting tools.

Please review the list of classes below and provide me with a list of 
individuals that you would like to attend each type of session and your first 
and second choose of sessions.  It will work better if we can fill an entire 
class with people from either the same group or that perform the same 
function.  This will help keep the classes focused.  Please provide an 
initial list to me by noon Monday July 31st.

I will be out of the office on Thurs. and Friday July 27-28.  I my absence 
please feel free to call Kim Lesley at 5-77713.  She will be happy to answer 
any questions you may have.

Subject: SAP and Seller Rules!!!! Please read

All,

July 1, SAP goes into effect for us here in Houston.  Also, the seller rules 
principle comes into play.  This means that if we (the IR/FX desk) owe you a 
payment in USD, GBP or EUR, you MUST book the payable in SAP to company 0967 
(we are no longer company 1Y3).  We then go into SAP and remove the block and 
that allows the payment to be sent.  

Per Corp., all intercompany trades are to be handled in this  manner.  This 
means that when you are paying us any of the 3 above currencies, we will go 
into SAP and book a payable to your company.  Going forward, when confirming 
settlements with Ana, you must be prepared to provide her with your company 
number.  You are then responsible for going into SAP and removing the block 
to allow payments to be released.  

Is SIFT UK interfacing directly to SAP, or will you manually be booking these 
entries?  If you are interfacing, the payable entry should automatically be 
created.  If you are  manually booking into SAP, you will need to coordinate 
with your accounting/reporting contacts to make sure that all of this goes 
smoothly.  If you are not the person who will be manually booking the entries 
into SAP, please forward this message to the appropriate person.

The purpose of this message is to update a variety of interested parties on 
the status of several "hot" topics.  I will be very brief, so please inquire 
if you want to know more.  Also, please forward to anyone I may have left off 
this distribution.  I can't remember everyone who attended the various 
meetings last week.

Reporting
Live Users - A number of workshops have been conducted and are scheduled to 
be conducted to help users better understand how to get at information in 
SAP.  APACHI and South America users have had workshops; CALME and EECC are 
scheduled, and NEPCO/OEC are being planned.  Please contact me, Greg Nikkel 
or Kim Lesley to find out more on status.  Also, any feedback you have for me 
on the effectiveness of these workshops and suggested next steps will be 
welcomed.
4/1 and 7/1 Go Lives - Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson and the 
respective representatives from the Business Units are working to make the 
next to go lives smoother with respect to reporting.  Again, any feedback you 
could pass on to me, Kathy Kokas, or Susan regarding suggestions or concerns 
is appreciated.
Long Term Reporting Strategy - We are still looking to identify a lead person 
to head up the long term reporting strategy.  This would involve 
understanding any true reporting gaps, as well as the right processes and 
tools for closing these gaps.  In addition, the right degree of "common" and 
business unit specific reporting needs to be defined, and the degree to which 
reporting solutions are function-specific or cross functional (e.g., 
financial, HR, procurement, projects).

Close/Consolidations
Bob Butts and Jan Johnson have taken point to head up a group to review the 
consolidation and close process to determine how/when we get the process 
optimized.  Susan Bellinghausen has followed up with Bob to schedule the 
requested demos of ECCS vs Hyperion functionality.

F/X
I was requested to obtain resources to do a third party review of the overall 
effectiveness of our foreign exchange transactions as they flow through 
different modules.  I am meeting with Kimberley Scardino of Arthur Andersen 
this week to outline the assignement, and have obtained a commitment from SAP 
America to bring appropriate SAP expertise to the review.  We expect to 
complete this review in approximately 3 weeks.  The outcome would be a report 
on whether effective processes and controls are in place for f/x processing, 
and suggestions for how we could more effectively use SAP's capabilities in 
this area.

Customers - please let me know how we're doing.  Thanks!

The cause of this was the timing of when SAP went down.  SAP had a major 
system crash the day Willie finaled his supply verification in Unify.  Before 
Willie went into SAP to net the payable (same day), SAP crashed.  By the time 
SAP came up, the treasury run had already picked up the payable and wired the 
cash.  When we issued the recall, the money was already out the door.

As a result, we put a policy in place that all supply verifications for 
netout customers must be overridden as soon as they are finaled in Unify.  
This causes them to be blocked in SAP and not picked up by treasury until the 
payment block is removed.  This policy went into effect at the beginning of 
September.  

However, this still relies on human intervention to ensure the procedure 
works.  To ensure we don't "accidentally" release cash, I have asked Unify IT 
to change the interface to send all purchases for ENA to SAP blocked, which 
will require the coordinator to release funds.  This is an added step, but is 
worth it considering the stakes.  This change will go into effect on Monday, 
9/25.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

I have read this series of e:mails but I am not sure that I fully understand

works?  Are both of these an issue?  Please let me know if we have a far

Sally,

Are you aware of the problems with SAP?  This error caused an incremental 
$600,000 credit loss to Perry Gas Companies that could have been prevented.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was 
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P 
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on 
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

Russell

Tonight Kris and I met with the SAP team about the critical issues we 
discussed in the meeting this morning.  

As far as Xref1 (coordinator) and Xref2 (physical vs. financial flag) fields 
go, it appears that we are getting what we have to have in order to go live 
7/1.  Rena was working on a spec (the OSS that was discussed) that would 
automatically populate these 2 fields.  However, the test was unsuccessful.  
These two fields are being opened up for netting, so we can input them 
manually when netting.  I believe we need to pursue the auto fill post 7/1, 
but the first priority is having a place to put the data.

As far as settlement period is concerned, we are probably going to get a 
hybrid of what we want at this time.  The SAP team does appear to have 
appropriate resources working on this issue.  For data created in SAP, I am 
more comfortable that the data is being captured on the income statement side 
of the entry, and the SAP folks now seem to think they can link over to it to 
get the settlement data.  For data converted, we will not be able to get the 
settlement period in the same manner.  The offsetting entry in conversion is 
to a dummy conversion account rather than an income statement account.  The 
dummy account doesn't carry the settlement date.  Another issue is related to 
the indicator to let us know if an invoice has had cash applied or

As you know, we have substantially wrapped up our work related to this 
project.  Today, we are making what I hope are final changes to the maps and 
deliverables, with the anticipation that we will deliver to you complete 
binders by Wednesday.  

One issue that we wanted to communicate relates to the use of manual payment 
processes and the risk that processing manual payments presents in the 
automated Unify/SAP environment.  This issue was raised by Melissa during our 
discussion of the manual cash reconciliation effort caused by the inability 
of SAP to auto-match cash receipts and disbursements in situations where the 
money has moved or been received, but the corresponding JE has not been made 
in SAP.  Both Melissa and Cindy Morrow have been involved in subsequent 
discussions related to the below-mentioned risks. 

1.  Risk of JE and payment duplication:

Payments taken directly to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in 
Unify:
 In the event that the transaction giving rise to the manual payment is 
entered initially into Unify (which would be the case for all normal 
commodity payments, excluding broker fee and broker margin payment 
transactions), a risk exists that the payment could be recorded and paid 
twice (once by either A/P or Treasury when the manual payment is wired and 
subsequently recorded, and once during the normal Unify to SAP interface).  
Process controls will be put in place to mitigate this risk; however, all 
controls will be people-based, not system-based.  It is too late to rebuild 
the Unify to SAP interface to better address the use of manual payments.  One 
additional suggestion might be to work with each group to reduce the use of 
manual payments except under well-defined, important circumstances.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If the payment is not entered into SAP with payment method "J", A/P will not 
realize that the payment has already been made and will process the 
disbursement a second time.

2.  Risk of understated expense:

Payments taken to Treasury and underlying transaction is recorded in Unify:
For manual payments that are not finalized in Unify (a process performed in 
the system to mark an invoice as final) by month-end (but the disbursement 
has already happened), expense will be understated.

Payments taken to Treasury, and underlying transaction is recorded directly 
to SAP (does not go through Unify):
If payment is not input into SAP by month-end but cash has moved, expense 
will be understated.  (Cash outflow account will show a credit balance which 
will be flipped to A/P, but no income statement entry will be made at that 
time.)

3.  Risk of cash misappropriation:

In addition to the above risks related to the use of manual payments, we also 
believe that a risk exists related to the use of Excel-generated counterparty 
invoices and the lack of segregation between the person responsible for 
preparing these invoices and also for handling/having access to the related 
accounting records.  We believe that it may be possible for a settlements 
coordinator to change the bank routing instructions or bank account number on 
the Excel invoice mailed to the counterparty and then manipulate the 
accounting records during the cash application process to either write off 
the account balance or to reflect the receivable as being paid while 
constantly moving cash application balances from one counterparty to another 
(so that no one account balance ages past an acceptable range).  We have been 
unable to determine a set of control procedures that would mitigate this risk.

4.  Revision to counterparty banking details:

We are currently investigating the procedure performed by Treasury when 
problems with bank account details cause payments to kick-out of Treasury 
workstation.  If the risk of misappropriation exists related to this 
procedure, we will separately communicate.

The above may be unclear.  If so, we would be glad to sit down with you for 
15 minutes or so and clarify.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project.

Hello Everyone,
Please find below the issues, action taken, and action plan / proposed 
resolution for GCP / SAP / Mid Office Systems interface.
If you have further questions/comments, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Janet

Issues:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code - Counterparty tax code for these countries are 
required in SAP but not in GCP.
Bank Partner Type Changes - Partner bank type changes for counterparties -- 
triggered by master data changes in GCP -- while bank data remains the same, 
resulting in invoices being paid to the incorrect bank and/or bank account.
Ownership - who owns what?

Action Taken:
Brazil and Argentina Tax Code
Meeting took place.  Agreed upon plan is for mid office user to provide tax 
requirements and/or codes to Bill.  SAP is waiting for tax requirements 
and/or codes to determine whether user exits should be disable (these are 
custom user exits SAP has implemented to accommodate the Brazil and Argentina 
tax requirements back from 1/01/00 go-live)
Bank Partner Type
Our understanding is GCP has agreed to modify the GCP program to keep bank 
partner type static.  GCP technical team is developing this solution.
Ownership
Mid Office Users own data
GCP maintains counterparty master data
GCP and SAP ensure that solution in place to move master data from GCP to SAP 
satisfy invoicing and cash processing business requirements.

Summary:
Many meetings have taken place.  Major progress has been made.  Now we need 
to evaluate GCP reengineering initiative to see whether it affects scope  and 
requirements regarding current solution in place for this 3-way interface.

Proposed Resolution:
SWAT team representing both Houston and London to be formed and meet in 
London week of Sep. 11- 15th to:
Address all issues evolving around this interface.
Develop solutions to issues, workplan, ownership, and timeline.
SWAT team members:
Janet Tran - SAP TRAPAR
Pamela LeBrane - SAP TRAPAR
Diem Pham - SAP Technical  -- Will already be in London that week for EEL
Bill Hare - GCP Functional (Houston)
Mary Solmonson - GCP Functional (Global)  -- Will already be in London that 
week for other business
Energy Operations Reprentative(s) - with Brazil / Argentina tax knowledge
Bhautik Patel - GCP Functional (London)
Brian Hunter-Lindsay - GCP Functional (London)
John Paskin - SAP London

Cindy,

At this time, Energy Operations is not prepared to sign off that SAP 
development for Energy Operations has been completed and that based on what 
was seen at user reviews all requirements have been met.  Having been in your 
position on other projects, I understand your need for this sign-off.  In an 
effort to focus both our teams on resolving and remaining outstanding issues, 
we can provide the following list of known items which remain unclear to us.

Mapping profit centers/books
Inability to unit test the power interface due to lack of profit center 
definition for power
AR reporting by product/coordinator/counterparty
Reversal of prepay accruals for Financial Settlements
Netting control point for AP
Reporting Entities (Co 842)
Report Requirements
Cash forecasting tools
Netting intercompany offsetting 3rd party (FX)
Monetizations
Controls on writeoffs
Flex file upload

Call Melissa at X35704 for detailed explanations.  I'm available as always at 
X33179.

THIS MESSAGE IS BEING SENT OUT ON BEHALF OF GREG NIKKEL AND KIM LESLEY


Below is a summary of our activities this past week

Accomplishments:
Delivered workshops at NEPCO
Gained agreement with NEPCO on status of showstopper reports
Scheduled India' s workshops for next week
Rolled out (to NEPCO) the user manuals developed


Upcoming:
Complete gathering of data points and begin to layout longer term strategy 
(Elaine and Kim)
Develop additional workshops (design and data flow, consolidations and 
intercompany)
Develop and deliver second evaluation
Roll out manuals to user group in Houston 


Where are we at?
We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation 
to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting 
out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of 
management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR 
and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I 
don't understand what the data is telling me. 

This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data 
in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available 
and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions 
(upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big 
learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand 
their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure 
out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1 
training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.

Thanks, again if you have any questions please contact Melissa, Greg or 
myself.

Some good news and not-so-good news in the brief update below.  Good news:  
lots of people invited to the user reviews, lots of people attending, and 
feedback has been positive.  Not-so-good news:  Lots of people are invited 
and NOT attending.

PLEASE make every effort to ensure that your representatives attend the user 
reviews.  We can't build the system you want without your input.  There are 
only a few more days before they are over.  

Thanks!

Based on feedback from the site managers, participants, and team members 
involved, the reviews have gone quite well.  Currently the team members are 
addressing minor parking lot issues captured during the sessions.  
Business unit team members have been an integral part in this process, and 
the project team values and appreciates their involvement.
Many thanks to the user community for making personal as well as business 
sacrifice to attend this event.  Without you, there would be no reviews.
Kudos to the project team members for your extra effort and thorough 
preparation to make this a successful event.
Keep up the good work and we will continue to keep you informed.
Meg and Janet

At the request of the Financial Council during its last meeting, the COE 
established a SWAT team to assist the business units in SAP reporting.  This 
is the first of weekly status reports that we will provide.

Purpose:  

The team has begun to hold small, interactive workshops with production users 
to:

Show users how to extract data from SAP by:
Using on-line inquiry
Using SAP standard reports and
Creating and modifying a variant
Educate users on the SAP data model and where business unit specific data 
resides in SAP (which module).
Better understand what additional reporting needs users may have.

Team structure: Lead:  Kim Lesley (consultant)
   PS:  Andreas Kraus (COE), Damon Willis (consultant)
   FI/CO:  Randy Parman (COE), Esther Cortes (consultant)
   Education support:  Maria Young (COE)

The structure of the team reflects the initial focus on project and financial 
reports.  It has been balanced to include COE support analysts who will 
provide long-term customer support plus SAP consultants with deep reporting 
knowledge.  We will adjust the team members as appropriate to address the 
material needed by the business units.

In addition to this team, Susan Bellinghausen and Emitra Nelson are 
continuing their efforts on 1/1, 4/1 and 7/1 report development.

Progress:

To date we have held 5 workshops with the Apachi and South American regions.  
These workshops have been evaluated across several criteria.  

On a scale of 1-4 (1 = not at all and 4 = absolutely), the workshops have 
received an average rating of 3.6 in learning reports and increasing comfort 
levels.  The workshops are definitely providing the one on one experience 
that the users are requesting.  They are also seeing and learning (hands on) 
various tools that are available to them to adjust the display of reports, 
query the data from each module and analyze the data.  The sessions are also 
helping to remove some of the fear associated with trying things in a new 
system by providing helpful tricks and hints from the experts.  

However, there is still a concern about increasing the understanding of where 
data resides within SAP.  This is reflected in the average rating to the key 
question "can SAP meet your needs" being only 2.5.  We will further explore 
why the users think this is the case and what they are not getting.   We are 
adjusting our sessions to address this and will continue to seek feedback.  

Upcoming key activities:

Schedule the remaining International region sessions and the EECC home office 
sessions.  We have the participant lists and are working on logistics.
Complete the analysis of the needs of the other business units in production.
Develop a process to follow up on these sessions to monitor the learning 
progress of the users.
Begin to evaluate a cost center reporting tool that Enron Europe has deployed 
in London.


I would like to thank the active participation of the business units in 
identifying and providing the right group of resources to the sessions.  If 
you have any questions or comments, feel free to address them to Melissa 
Becker, Kim Lesley or myself.

Greg

the investment in SAP for Enron and for each business area.  You have been 
selected (whether officially or in an unofficial capacity) to represent a 
business area's SAP needs and wants for 2001.  In this capacity, you will be 
a major part of building upon Enron's SAP investment.  Your partners in this 
adventure will be the ISC.  

The Customer Relations solution area of the ISC invites you to join the ISC 
leadership to kick off 2001.  We'll be facilitating introductions and 
providing an overview of the roles and responsibilities of both the business 
area representatives and ISC leadership.  

The goals of the kick-off are to:

Clarify the roles and responsibilities of the ISC leadership and the business 
area representatives
Prepare the business area representatives for the SAP User Group kick-off in 
February
Begin developing the SAP "wish list" for 2001
Have a little fun getting to know one another

An agenda will be sent the week of January 8.  Please join us.

Date:  Wednesday, January 17
Time:  8:45 - 9:45 a.m.
Location:   EB 5C2

You will be receiving more information from Rick and Cindy, but here are the 
dates for the offsite Rick and Cindy are hosting to:
 Assess what we have accomplished with SAP relative to the original goals
 Assess where we are today (new initiatives on the horizon, acquisition 
strategy, state of the COE, etc)
 Determine strategically where we go next.

For those that participated in either or both of the original ASEs 
(Accelerated Solutions Environment, a professionally facilitated, 
specially-designed location for rapid, large-group decision making), this 
event will be similar in format (not content).  If you have not previously 
particpated in an ASE, detailed information will be forthcoming.

The likely location is Dallas (a new ASE has just been opened there).  We MAY 
be able to trim this down to two days (not probable, but we are going to 
try), but for now please plan on 3 full days (8 am to 7 pm or later).

The above is not the final invitee list (we will likely add a few more 
people), but we wanted to geet this on your calendars as soon as we had the 
date.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you will or will not be able 
to attend, and if there is anyone from your organization that you feel is 
critical to achieving the objectives above.

Thank you!

As scheduled, we are planning a quick status check meeting on the SAP / Unify 
/ Financials project  at 4:00 today. 

Key points that will be discussed include: 
Current status of any open requirement points (and resolutions to close them)
Current status of Financials development and testing (hopefully some good 
news here)
Current status of SAP interface test (and we believe some good news here as 
well)
Current status of contingency automated interface to Sift (Net-net: It's too 
difficult to develop this in the required time but with the good news above  
we may not need it)
Status and action items for FIT4 test planning in June. 


Thanks.

As we discussed in Rick's staff meeting,  you can help your 7/1/00 go-live go 
more smoothly, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only.  
Here is one way.

Timekeeping, though it seems mundane on the surface, is a focal point of the 
SAP integration.  Entry and coding of time populates not just payroll, but 
projects and cost centers, real time.  We will now have more flexibility to 
charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work (where 
people work on more than one area at a time).  This will only happen to the 
extent that the business and cost center owners drive it.  This capability is 
customizable not just by business unit or company, but by cost center within 
a company.

To make this work HOW YOU WANT IT TO on 7/1, each "organizational unit" (as I 
said above, you can drive this in your cost center(s) only or across your BU) 
needs to be clear on questions such as:

1.  Whether or not they want contractors to enter time in SAP
2. Whether you want positive timekeeping (each pay period specifying the cost 
center or projects one worked on) or "exceptions" only (e.g., vacation, sick 
time, etc)
3.  Whether an approval process is desired and if so, what it is
4.  Whether people will record their own time using the self service 
capability eHROnline (typically more precise and less handoffs) or whether 
they will continue to use a timekeeper (typically a little more convenient 
for people who (a)  rarely have access to a computer or (b) work in many 
different areas and are not willing/able to identify and use cost center 
numbers or project codes 
5.  Whether people  know the projects and cost center codes they should 
charge to

Your leadership in clarifying this within your cost center and/or BU will be 
instrumental in driviing the level of change you desire, as well as 
minimizing the noise related to the 7/1 go -live.  We have been using a 
variety of methods to communicate and drive much of this change, but the 
business drive for how much to utilize the tool is determined by you.

The deadline for the first SAP time entry period is 3 pm Houston time on 
Friday, June 30.

Despite all our collective efforts, I expect that it will be a few pay 
periods before we get each individual clear on what level of acitivity is 
desired from him by his cost center or company.  Thanks for your help in 
getting through the transition period.  Please call me or Andrea Yowman if 
you have any questions.

Last week y'all asked us to follow up with several key individuals within the 
ENA group to see how it's going with SAP.  We were not to give any "hints"; 
just ask some open-ended (but probing) questions.  I'm attaching all the 
responses (Georgeann directed us to Greg W ).  I don't see anything alarming 
or red-hot -- I just hope they were being totally candid and honest with 
us!!  Overall I would categorize them as normal support issues around the 
areas of needing some spot "1-on-1" training for users, more experience in 
overall information retrieval, editing of some reports, our security process 
and the difficulty of getting information from various and sundry databases 
(since SAP is interfaced) to get the full picture.

We have passed all these items on to the appropriate Solution Mgr, so that 
they can specifically address them.

As I think I mentioned several months ago we had complaints about 
nonresponsiveness (calls not being returned, being passed around alot, etc).  
Hopefully we've turned the corner there.

Please let me know if there are other areas you'd like us to address (as we 
discussed), otherwise we will continue to try to keep our finger on the 
pulse.  And please let me know who our contact person from ENA should be.


Thanks,

KK

Subject: ENA Summary

Kathy,

Please find the highlights below from my ENA customer meetings:

Bryce Baxter

Pleased overall with the support provided by the ISC

Small issues voiced by Bryce, not strong sources of contention :
Feels the response time does not happen with 'lightning speed', but works 
fine once they agree to a deadline with Pamela LeBrane
Zcash specification changes delayed due to errors identified by both groups, 
but they are still moving forward
Payment runs are generated early on occassion and it is tough to cancel a 
payment (they are blocking all payments now to avoid this issue)
Unify to SAP interface - files are not being picked up at least once a week 
(certain files 'drop off'); Mary Tyler Marz (ENA) and Teresa Mira (ISC) are 
working on this issue 

Leslie Reeves
Pleased overall with the support provided by the ISC

Areas Leslie would like assistance from the ISC:
Further editing on reports; understanding what information is available and 
how they can extract the information from SAP
Further training (coaching sessions) by members of the ISC Solution Teams to 
help with the following areas:
How to pull data from SAP (data mining)
Explanation of how to find all the pieces required to complete their monthly 
reconciliation process (balancing cost centers, reconciling the P&L to the G/L
Explanation of the interface reconciliation process for financial out of 
balances
Explanation of the steps required for new accounts, business areas, cost 
centers, allocation process (needs to fully understand the process in SAP)
Follow up with Debbie Brackett in Credit to determine if she is receiving the 
credit information from SAP in a timely manner
I told Leslie that I would follow up with Susan B. and Brandee and ask them 
to call her directly.  Leslie would like to meet with each of them and then 
determine the correct individuals on her team to become involved in the 
process.

Both Bryce and Leslie were very appreciative of the customer focused 
attention from the ISC.  They both thought it was great that we scheduled 
time to visit with them and understand their questions/issues.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mary

Greg,

Thank you for taking time to meet with me today about the ISC and SAP.  I 
appreciated your explanations and your feedback.  Please see if I have 
captured the main points below.  If so, no need to reply.  If not, please 
provide corrections or elaborations.  

I will talk with Sheila and Brandee about the best course of action to get 
Laura Scott's feedback about the issues in Canada.  I'll also check on the 
status of Hyperion.

I passed along your comments about Michael Gilmore to both Michael and his 
manager Vince Cacaro.  Both were pleased to receive positive customer 
feedback.

Regards,
Rebecca

----------------------

ENA's (Financial) SAP "Wish List"

Earlier inter-company cutoffs in month-end close, to facilitate the overall 
close process.
Clarity around the status of Hyperion -- will it be here beyond the end of 
the year?  If so, will the process for mapping between FI/CO and Hyperion be 
addressed?
Getting all the information for our customers into the same repository.  Brio 
should be the answer to many of our issues, as it should ultimately integrate 
data from the Tag database (ERMS), Empower, Unify, CPI, and Solark.  
A different type or level of support during month-end close, at least through 
1Q 2001.  In order of criticality, the issues/needs to be addressed are:
security (making sure people have the correct security and have it prior to 
month-end close)
cost center & profit center set-up (ultimately, centralized set-up is the 
right thing, but the process during close needs work)
reporting (quicker/better access to the right data post close)

Subject: Unify AR -- SAP Plans


	

Two years ago Enron North America made a decision to use Unify AR for cash 
application rather than SAP AR.  We decided at the time that SAP AR would be 
kept in sync with Unify AR by the Unify/SAP interface.  We believe that the 
business logic for that decision has changed, and are now recommending that 
Unify AR be permanently turned off and all AR functions be performed in SAP.  
I have briefly summarized the change in business situation below.

Two Years Ago	Today
Netting allowed by legal and credit ONLY if netting contract was already in 
place.	Netting encouraged by legal and credit wherever possible, regardless of 
existence of signed agreement.
Netting limited to one counterparty and legal entity at a time.	Canada nets across 
counterparties.
Netting performed in physical only, financial settlements to maintain 
separate net statement process.	ENA considering netting physical and financial 
together.
All account coordinators were to apply their own cash.	Cash applied centrally in 
Power, Financial and Canada  Individual coordinators apply cash only in 
physical Gas.
Cash was to be applied at the line item level to track variances and to 
facilitate calculation of cost of funds by commercial team.	Although gas 
settlements is applying cash for some invoices at the line item level, this 
functionality is not being used by power settlements and will not be used by 
financial settlements.  The company has not made any move towards calculating 
cost of funds by commercial team.
The Account Inquiry functionality in Unify was thought to be a key on-line 
tool.	Old habits die hard...most users appear to be printing reports and reviewing 
data, rather than using the on-line functionality.
Overapplication of cash was not to be allowed.  Overpayments would be 
classified as "on account", with issues tracked in a case management system.	Case 
management system does not exist.  Allowing overapplication helps the account 
coordinators track overpayments easier than leaving cash on account.
The counterparty/legal entity combination on the deposit needed to match the 
counterparty/legal entity combination on the Enron invoice.	Given the number of legal 
entities Enron has, along with the number of entities our counterparties 
have, this seems like a hopeless battle.  Allowing cross-application of cash 
seems easier.
Corp required that intercompany settlements had to be "settled" with cash 
movement.	Corp no longer requires intercompany settlements to be "settled" with cash 
movement.

Converting to SAP AR simplifies the Unify/SAP interface in the following ways:
Bank deposits into SAP do not have to be split off into Unify
Cash entries in Unify do not have to be interfaced back to SAP
Unify netting entries do not have to be interfaced to SAP
Payables information does not have to be interfaced from SAP to Unify

Given the change in attitudes towards our netting business process we face 
two problems in Unify.  
Controls built into Unify are already obsolete.
Unify does not maintain all products in one database, making efforts to net 
across products in the future (physical with financial, for instance) 
impossible.

Our understanding of the netting process in SAP indicates that there are no 
controls (which sounds good at this point) and that we would retain the 
automatic netting entries when the payable is netted with the receivable 
within SAP.  However, we emphasize that netting would be done in SAP, not at 
the time of finaling a payment in Unify.

To repeat, we are recommending that Unify AR be turned off and we convert to 
SAP AR.  We will schedule a meeting the week of February 22 to discuss.  
Please call me at X33179 with any questions or comments.  We WILL make this 
decision by February 28 because the SAP timeline does not allow any 
additional time for consideration.

Stephen

The response to eHRonline has been extremely positive, with over 1500 people 
using the system on the first day alone!  Though many of you have experienced 
success, some of you are logging on and encountering some "bumps" -- mainly 
questions relating to your system ID or issues related to your web browser 
settings.  Those with questions or issues have been calling the COE and some 
are having to wait due to the increased call volume.  

To increase our accessibility during this phase of implementation, we are . . 
.

increasing our call center staffing to decrease your wait time.
working with the Business Unit IT departments to resolve individual browser 
setting issues.

To help us help you, please . . .

Take a screen shot of any error message you receive and send it to the COE at 
SAP COE/Corp/Enron or SAP.COE@enron.com.
Be patient over the next few days when calling the COE -- remember that we 
are adding over 8500 new users.
Have the following information available when you call:
Your name, location, extension, and business unit
Your personnel number, if you know it
The exact text of any error message you receive

We appreciate your cooperation.

Accomplishments:
Conducted several workshops with EECC and the CALME region this week
Scheduled workshops with NEPCO
Have identified the needs to be addressed in the NEPCO workshops and are 
arranging appropriate resources
Met with the London COE to discuss their status in terms of reporting (we are 
sharing data from workshops)
Have made an initial offer to Corp HR cost center users to conduct workshops 
for them
Brought in some EY help to work with the business units to understand the 
multiple environments, extraction and analysis tools being used by the 
different business units

Upcoming:
Additional workshops for EECC and ESA
Identification of the Corp groups that would like to have these sessions made 
available (and subjects they would like to cover)
Will complete the "user" guides with screen prints to give out to all 
participants (step by step instructions, tools, and tips)
Finalize the NEPCO workshops (Mar 20-22)
Produce a plan for upcoming workshops for ECCS and Design review


Summary analysis of evaluations from this week's workshops:
Our overall belief is that the workshops, the one on one attention, the new 
content etc. are being received very well (scores averages around 3.5 on a 
scale of 1-4)
The score for the question of whether SAP will meet the reporting needs is 
still too low (average of 2.8).  We will continue to analyze the root cause 
of this problem.  
There is definitely an improvement in people understanding which modules 
contain which data.  We believe that a hand-out we developed really helped 
this and will continue to continue to emphasize this learning.

Comments received:
Very good and useful
Could have used this sooner
Sessions are not long enough
I love the workshop idea, its so much better than training classes

Feel free to contact me, Melissa or Kim with any questions or concerns.

As you are aware, the SAP Financial Systems will be implemented for the Enron 
Gas Pipeline Group, Enron North America and Enron Energy Services companies 
on July 1, 2000.  To effectively transfer the invoice processing from the 
legacy MSA system to the SAP system, the following dates should be followed:


June 23: Invoice processing on the MSA system will stop except for emergency 
payments, wire transfers and ACHs.

June 26: Invoice processing on the SAP system will begin for the GPG, ENA and 
EES companies.  Accounts Payables will input invoices into the SAP system 
starting on this date, but checks will not be printed until the first payment 
run is processed on July 5.

June 28: Last day to input employee expense reports with ACH in the MSA 
system.

June 29: Last day to input emergency payments and wire transfers in the MSA 
system.

June 30: Accounts Payable to clean up outstanding open balances in the MSA 
system.

July 5:  All invoices will be entered into SAP and the first payment run is 
processed.


Please remember, all invoices sent to Accounts Payable on or after June 23 
must have SAP general ledger coding applied to the invoice.

Key points that will be discussed include: 
Current status of any open requirement points (and resolutions to close them)
Current status of Financials development and testing (hopefully some good 
news here)
Current status of SAP interface test (and we believe some good news here as 
well)
Current status of contingency automated interface to Sift (Net-net: It's too 
difficult to develop this in the required time but with the good news above  
we may not need it)
Status and action items for FIT4 test planning in June. 


Thanks.

Sally,

Are you aware of the problems with SAP?  This error caused an incremental 
$600,000 credit loss to Perry Gas Companies that could have been prevented.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Russell - as I remember, Willie finaled the Supply Verification and it was 
interfaced to SAP.  This is fine, and then Willie was going to net the A/P 
and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

Willie,

Per our earlier conversation, can you or Audrey or Bryce, please give further 
explain to me as to why the funds were wired to Perry Gas for purchases from 
the counterparty instead on netting the amounts between purchases and sales.  
You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on 
SAP, although because of timing, the override did not take place.

Thank you,

Russell

At the Financial Council meeting last Thursday, we distributed a write-up 
entitled "Workshops".  In it we discussed the work performed to date, the 
results, and three options for proceeding.

Could you please take a look at the document (it's a very quick read), call 
me if you need more information, and then "vote" for which option you would 
prefer?  I would appreciate your response by this Friday.  if you don't vote, 
then you will get what the majority votes for.  If there is significant 
division in the votes, we can discuss a "tailored" approach at the next 
Financial Council meeting.

We are trying to do what YOU want; we just need you to tell us which approach 
you prefer.  Thanks!

The August end of month close is behind us.  Once again, we learned some 
things. We made progress.....but we also have issues to work. 


Summary On Improvements For This End Of Month Close

I would like to congratulate the users, the application team and the DBA team 
for a much improved end of month close for August gas. This would not have 
been possible without the significant commitment, focus and teamwork 
exhibited by all the folks involved in this effort. 

The most tangible measure of progress over the July close : 
We were able to keep all users in the system throughout the final week. No 
one was kicked off the system.
The gas accounting close process finished on time. Key users and IT folks 
didn't have to work significant overtime to finish the process. 

 Improvements arose from : 

Upgrading the Unify system to Sybase 12 with extra server memory. This 
reduced system 'locking and blocking' and made it possible to keep all users 
in the system throughout the week. Nightly settlements for gas invoicing also 
ran much faster. Many thanks to the DBAs - Jim Ogg and Kishroe Bharathi-- for 
many late nights and weekends. Many thanks also to the application team and 
the users for lots of testing before the production rollout.

Conducting a pre-planning session that identified new end of month techniques 
to improve efficiency. The users generated several new ideas including the 
idea to pre-process PMAs the night before running the current mass draft. 
This meeting provided several new approaches, a clear plan and cohesive 
communication throughout the end of month process. Many thanks to the all the 
users as well as Bob Superty, Bryce Baxter, Melissa Ratnala, Dave Nommensen 
and Chris Schomer for making this happen. Many of these ideas will now be 
part of a standard process. 

The performance monitoring and tuning team reacted quickly to address changes 
in system performance. Many thanks to Matt Pena and the rest of this team for 
keeping the system up and running as fast as possible during the day. 

Release of a new tuned version of the Accurals process that runs much faster. 


Issues, Challenges, Action Items

While we made progress this month, there are still several significant issues 
and opportunities for improvement. The following is a list of the things that 
'went bump in the night' and the action items we've identified. 

1. We experienced several Sybase 12.0 errors early in the week that impacted 
gas business. All of these problems are now fixed. This had the following 
business impacts: 
The bridgeback of deals to Sitara was delayed. These deals were bridged 
manually before the end of month valuation. We also fixed the code problem 
that generated th original problem.
Global Systems replication to Unify was down on Monday. This problem was 
fixed with a software patch from Sybase Monday evening. All affected deals 
were then uploaded. Nominations were completed for these deals on Monday 
through manual estimation by the schedulers. 
Communication between the DBA group and the application group was delayed on 
the Global Systems replication problem. This delayed our ability to notify 
users of the problem. Communication on problems will be be improved in the 
future. The default assumption will be to notify key application and 
infrastructure personnel as soon as any serious problem is identified. 

2.  We experienced a hardware issue with a bad server CPU at 3:00AM on 
Thursday.  As a result, database backups ran into the morning when the server 
came back up. This created slow system response and delayed logins for users 
until 10:00 AM. This problem is now fixed. 
 Action Item: Kishore will coordinate with Randy Matson from the 
infrastructure group to coordinate a stress test of all production server 
components. This will allow us to see if we can find any other marginal 
components.  This will be completed by September 18. 

3. All service PMAs for ENA and HPLC were not picked up by the Settlements 
process. HPLC PMAs were run manually by the users. For ENA, missing PMAs were 
immaterial and the users decided to close with these results. We have now 
found and fixed the error that caused this problem. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer is having his team investigate this problem to 
see if this is just a Sybase 12.0 issue or whether this error could have 
impacted previous months. A determination should be available by September 
15. 

4. Enpower deal load did not load deals with referenced prices correctly. 
These deals have now been successfully loaded and are currently completed 
through the mass draft process for power. We have identified and fixed the 
software error that caused this problem. 

5. Power mass draft is now running very slow as compared to prior months. We 
are currently working to complete the Power mass draft process. It will be 
completed by the user deadline for close of business Wednesday Sept. 6. 
 Action Item: Chris Schomer's team is investigating why the Power mass draft 
is running so slow.  At present we do not have a definitive answer. We hope 
to develop a definitive answer and action plan by September 15. Our current 
hypothesis for why we have this problem includes : 
Data changes - we now have a much higher volume of hourly priced deals
Potential database index issues. We will re-build all power database indexes 
and re-compile the stored procedures
Sybase optimizer flakiness. We often see Sybase suddenly start to have 
processing problems for no apparent reason.  


Update On Future Tactical  And Strategic Improvements

We have several pending tactical Unify performance improvements that are in 
process. These include: 

1) Isolating Unify Gas on a server of it's own 
2) Delivery of a middle tier mass draft process to reduce locking and blocking
3) Upgrade of the middle tier mass draft process to allow for drafting at a 
deal level (rather than just a counter-party level)
4) Delivery of the nominations and balancing process on a middle tier 
architecture.

Ramesh Rao and his team have the strategic projects progressing on schedule.  
We are seeing significant performance gains in our testing of SQL Server over 
Sybase. We also have identified a couple of hardware vendors that could 
provide very large, scaleable computing environments for this type of Unify 
architecture. We plan to have all critical evaluation testing completed by 
the end of September as planned. We will present our recommendations along 
with a high-level strategic delivery plan by early October. 


Let me know if you have any questions or concerns --  x39694 or (713)

Thanks.

Subject: update on offsite

I am happy to report that, because so many people wanted to bring a "first 
lieutenant", Rick and Cindy have agreed to put the primary focus of the Aug 
29-31 offsite on financials and procurement, with enough HR representation to 
cover some of the broad strategic issues that cross multiple functional 
areas.  

Consequently, Elise and Mike will be able to attend.  More information on 
logistics to follow within two weeks.  We will block off hotel rooms, etc. in 
the meantime.  

As with the last ASE, it's an "all or nothing" proposition.  Because of the 
structure of the event, participants must be there from start to finish (no 
partial attendance).  We are still trying to get it to 2 days, but worst case 
we will set it so that people can fly up Tuesday morning and fly back 
Thursday night.

I am looking forward to everyone's participation and input.Thanks!

Just a follow-up to a voice mail I left you last week since I haven't heard 
from you.   Do you have any documentation of the results of your SAP process 
audit?  I am particularly interested in the areas of Global Counterparty and 
the interface to SAP for customer and vendor master data.  We are 
experiencing considerable problems and are curious to see your findings.  If 
the audit was not in enough detail, then I would like to have you come back 
for a more detailed look.
