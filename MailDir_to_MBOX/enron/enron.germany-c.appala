John, I'm sorry my question was not clear. Please advise which Sitara deal 
tickets you want changed to match the spreadsheet volumes. This will be your 
decision as a trader. If it doesn't matter, then we can choose a deal ticket 
to adjust. Please advise by this afternoon, February 29th.

You have great ideas about consolidating the deal tickets. That is a 
commercial/trader role. Not sure who makes these decisions at Enron. You may 
want to check with your boss, Nelson Ferries or the Desk Director, Dick 
Jenkins. What I have found about Enron, if you have a good idea... just go 
for it... if it makes sense.

If your group does decide to consolidate these tickets... then please have 
the person responsible for inputting your deal tickets to do this 
consolidation. My understanding that Enron has hired someone to help you with 
the billing process for your appalachian producers... not sure if that person 
will also be inputting your deal tickets.

I'll ask Victor about the report by counterparty. CPR print manager has a lot 
of different print options and sorts for the Sitara Deal tickets.

Thanks for your patience!

Subject: Re: March Deals - Help!!!!  

I'm not sure how to answer you question.  For some reason, when the CES deals 
were input into ENRON's system, someone decided to put each tier of a deal 
into Sitara as a seperate deal.  Therefore, instead of having one deal with 
tiered prices to path, there are multiple deals to be pathed for the same 
counterparty (ie the same deal).

I would like to talk to whomever is in charge and suggest that where 
possible, only one deal with tiered prices appear in Sitara.

Since there are multiple deals instead of tiered pricing for JD Drilling , 
Power Gas , Riley & Scot and Viking Energy, you will most likely need to path 
each deal seperately unless someone decides that only one deal with tiered 
prices is appropriate.

If anyone is interested, I would gladly provide the information necessary to 
set up single deals with tiered pricing. 

It would also be helpful to have a report which would show the Sitara deals 
by counterparty. This would facilitate creating single deals with tiered 
pricing where applicable.

John

I have a question relating to Sitara Deal # 235505.  Columbia Natural 
Resources has invoiced me for some volumes at Tennessee,  42012 mmbtus at 
2.988.  Sitara deal # 235505 has gas at Tennessee but the volume is off and 
the price is $3.01.  Additionally I have a copy of an e-mail( May 9) that was 
sent to Anita Chin showing a rate of 2.988 for April Production and 3.195 for 
May production for a deal on Tennessee.  What I need to know, is deal #235505 
the deal that is referenced in the e-mail ?  If it is the price needs to be 
adjusted to reflect $2.988, if not  what is the deal number for the 
transaction that was referenced in the e-mail to Anita Chin.


Could you please take a look and let me know.  

Thanks

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Subject: Peoples

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples
  Phillips   Power Gas Marketing
Term
Price
Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

John

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). 
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered 
with the CES prefix.

John, can you fill in the missing details?

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that

Wade,  Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help 
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind 
the citygate deals  

Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate 
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and 
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of 
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to 
account for these transactions internally.

It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the 
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also 
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie 
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. 

Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in 
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???

By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!  
Please keep me abreast of the status.

Subject: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production

ENA is being invoiced by Phillips Production Company for production on  
Dominion Transmission (CNG) via Peoples Natural Gas.  This is 
behind-city-gate gas that we do not get documents supporting the volumes. I 
have invoices and production statements from Phillips.  

Per John Singer Notes Mail of 08/23 concerning the July production," Phillips 
Production / Peoples: Price:  @ $2.95/Mcf  Term:  1/1/2000 - 11/30/2000 Est. 
Volume:  500/MCFD  (Actual Volume will vary.)   I have no way of verifying 
the actual volume.  Chris Germany and Angie Zeman will try to get into CES's  
PNG pool via E-Script.  This may be the only way to verify actual volumes.  I 
have a call into Phillips to see if they might have a pipeline statement 
verifying volumes."  Joihn's call to Phillips read partially,  " I just 
talked to Sam Fragale @ Phillips.  The 7,843 Mcf @ $2.95 is ENA's. "

Our deals have been using point 20200 on Dominion Transmission (CNG).  Deals 
for Jan 00 - Mar 00 were 210359 and 210364.  These were copied to 226543 and 
229733 respectively for April 00 forward  Deal 226543 has April 00 only, but 
should probably be extended through June-00 according to deal notes from John.
Here is our current status on this gas

Prod  Invoice  Invoice  Current  
Month  Volume  Price  Unify Vol Sitara Deal 

May-00  4801  @$2.82  163  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9748  @$2.95  353  229733

June-00  5341  @$2.82  0  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9394  @$2.95  0  229733

July-00  7843  @$2.95  9552  229733

We need to get our proccess together for handling this each month through the 
end of the deal terms.

Please direct the appropriate parties to help make these invoiced volumes 
available on the deal and in Unify so I can pay Phillips.

Thanks  WRP

The contracts are the transportation agreements on CNR.  Robert sat with 
Chris Germany yesterday and to our knowledge these gathering contracts have 
never been set up in our systems.  

I'll be in meetings until 3:30, so please feel free to talk to Robert Allwein 
down on 30.  Actually, I think it would be a great idea to spend a few 
minutes talking about this to get on the same page before anyone gets too far 
into the process and we discover that rework is being done.

I just meet with Gloria to decipher what the status is on all her E-mails.  
She's identified all the remaining rate changes needed for today's payments, 
the transport contracts needed to be setup, Sitara numbers needed for 
contracts already set up, and the meters needing to be linked to transport 
contracts.  I'm still fuzzy on this whole process and am not sure what Robert 
Allwein's 60 or 70 contracts relate to... are these purchase contracts?   
I'll be up shortly, working with Brenda... let's see if a meeting would be 
good.

Subject: Dominion Transmission Gathering Charges

On Thursday, December 7,2000, IOGA WV and Dominion Transmission (formerly CNG 
Transmission)  announced that they have reached a five year agreement on 
gathering rates.  Although this agreement is subject to FERC's approval, 
there should be no problem having FERC OK.

This agreement becomes effective January 1, 2001.  Under the agreement, 
Dominion WILL NOT invoice either the producer or his agent (i.e. ENA) for 
gathering or processing.  Instead, Dominion will increase the gas retention 
percentages to cover the costs of both gathering and processing.  They are:

                                                       1/1/2001 - 6/30/2003   
                 7/1/2003 - 12/31-2005

Transmission Dry                                       
0                                                          0
Transmission Wet                                  
3.91%                                                  3.51%
Gathering Dry                                           
9.34%                                                   9.34%
Gathering Wet                                          
13.25%                                               12.85%           

As of yesterday, Dominion was not sure exactly how they will communicate  the 
production information to the producer and/or his agent.  My guess is that 
they will send a  monthly statement which willl have two volumes for each 
meter.  The first volume will be the wellhead volume delivered to the meter 
(a gross volume) .  This volume will be adjusted by the retention percentage 
which will equate to the sales volume (gross volume less gathering and/or 
processing).  The sales volume will be the volume we will pay the producer 
for since it will be net of gathering and/or processing.  There will be no 
additional charges.  ENA will not be required send monies to Dominion.

As additional information becomes available, I will forward.

John

Good morning.   I did locate the pooling agreement request form.   We had
originally talked about mailing these to you but faxing would be quicker.  I
am faxing that to you this morning.   It needs to be completed and faxed
back to us as soon as you can.   Also,  I am faxing a Pool Meter List form
and a Pool Operator Confirmation form (these are also available on our
website (www.equitrans.com) under the Equipath menu option.)

The Pool Meter List form needs to list all meters that you are placing in
your pool.   The Pool Operator Confirmation form will need to list all of
the shippers and their contracts that will be nominating out of your pool.


The Pool Meter List and the Pool Operator Confirmation form will need to be
completed monthly.  Normally these are due to Equitrans 30 days prior to gas
flow.  We will make an exception for August as this will be your first
month.  Try to have the latter two forms to us by mid July.

Yes, the producer receives a fixed price, however, these deals are probably 
in TAGG as Nymex plus basis deals.  Phillips deal was transferred to ENA, 
Power Gas was triggered on ENA books.
Or does it matter???

Here is what I know.  We started pulling 430 MCF (443 dth) from pool N424PB 
effective 7-1-00 which was changed to 430 dth effective 7-18-00.  I'm 
assuming pool N424PB is the CES/ENA non-priority pool.  Let me know if we 
need to do anything different on our side.

Subject: Re: PNG Local Production July 00  

Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Subject: Phillips Production PNG gas

For July, Phillips for PNG billed 12234 in volume (4391 at 3.02  and 7843 at 
2.95)  Sitara only has a deal for the 2.95  on  301/day=9331.  Can you 
clarify the pricing and volumes?

Also, I left you a voice mail about Braxton pricing for their Equitrans 
production.  Please reply.

Thanks

Brenda - isn't there a Cornwell pool and Hastings pool that is not an 
imbalance account?
ESOG does not carry an imbalance, but right now I cannot enter any volumes in 
these imbalance
accounts.  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

We have WV produced TCo.  To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer.  CES never 
wanted to buy Mountaineer production because of the daily balancing for both 
the production and the end-user side.

FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating 
that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me 
know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.

I have invoice information for CNG Field Services for january 2000 that John 
Singer sent to me.  Their are two deals out there that have the IF + 0.12 
pricing according to John's notes. 

Deal  204785 has location 25-35 CPA Pittsburg and has volumes actualized ( I 
am having trouble drafting a statement though) .  This deal was entered by 
Chris Germany on 2/24.  The volumes currently allocated to this deal are  
23,963  versus the 13,113 on the invoice.

Deal 216175 has location 25E CPA-4  with the same pricing, but no volumes. 
Wade Price entered this deal on 3/10 (not knowing of the other deal until a 
couple of days ago).  This deal should be killed.

I will pay the invoice as soon as we can correct the deal, the confirm the 
volumes, and get a supply verification out.

Thanks for everyone's assistance and interest in taking care of these.  WRP

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Attached is the backup fro the Jan, Feb and Mar for Belden & Blake's NYSEG 
invoices.  I created these spreadsheets from the information given me by 
Heidi Boyd, who was the person nominating this gas for CES.  Belden & Blake 
invoiced ENA base on these spreadsheets.
 The NYSEG gas is a back to back purchase/sale to CES.  There should be a 
deal for the sale in the system for the sale.  Check with Chris Germany.
There are three price scenarios for the gas.  Should there be a spereate  
deal for each price?

Actually, prior to the CES acquisition we had between 200 and 500 little 
wells of metered production in the Appalachian area of our own.  These wells 
produce anywhere from 10 dt's to 10,000 dt's per day.  Most are very minimal, 
probably 500 dt's or less.  This production is produced on several gathering 
lines off of CNG and Columbia Gas.  A couple of years ago Columbia Gas 
started getting out of the gathering business and sold part of the wells to 
Gatherco, then they spun off part to CNR, and the remainder are still held by 
Columbia Gas.  Around the 10th of the month we get estimates from Gatherco 
and CNR as to what it appears that the individual wells are producing and 
then we nominate the gas, which takes up to several hours of updating time.  
The Columbia Gas meters we do not have to individually nominate to the pipe.  
We receive an estimate from the pipe for the total volume and they give us 
credit for it in our pool.  Sounds simple.  The problem comes three months 
down the road when we get the actuals from Columbia Gas as to what flowed at 
these meters and accounting has to go in and make payments to all these 
little producers. 

Prior to unify, it didn't really effect us.  Client Services would just zero 
out the one lump estimate that we had made and then they would go in and add 
each producer, the wells that flowed, the volume and make the final payment 
to each.  It was a very time consuming process and they had one person who 
was solely devoted to doing nothing but this.  Because unify was developed to 
put as much work up front in the process, client services no longer has the 
'back door' to get the payment out the door.  This means that each well that 
we have on Columbia Gas must now have an individual ticket in sitara  with a 
volume of 0 (currently our responsibility to set up) and must have at least 
one path with a volume of 1 for each month in unify.  Several months ago 
after converting to unify, Robert, Molly Lafuze, Kathy Moore, and Victor put 
in a massive effort over the course of about three weeks to get all of our 
own meters taken care of while still maintaining their respective jobs.  
Generally, it's the same meters that flow and when we set them up, we do it 
over a long period of time so the path just rolls from one month to next and 
as long as we keep up our tracking and balancing, we're just in maintenance 
mode.  However, sometimes new wells come up, at which point the process is to 
1) have the global group set up the meters and the counterparties, 2) set up 
a deal in sitara, 3) put a path in unify with a volume of 1, 4) create noms, 
and 5) track and balance.  Since we don't even get actuals to 3 months after 
flow, we usually have at least 3 to 4 months of catch up to do.  And of 
course, as you are aware, our systems have been running a little slow lately.

With the acquisition of CES we have taken on even more of the gas.  I've 
heard on a couple of occasions just how many wells this is, but I'm sorry, 
the number seems to have escaped me.  I know it is at least several hundred 
and that it is quit a bit more than we had previously. 

This whole subject is one that has been passed around by several people 
including myself, Chris Germany, John Singer, Jim Javins, and Scott Neal on 
more than one occasion.  One thought that John Singer and Jim Javins had was 
to have someone named Hiedi in Jim's office get access to our systems and 
input the gas herself.  Seems like a nice suggestion, except that she is EES 
and I don't think that we want her in our sytems.  By the way, John Singer 
and Jim Javins are the ones buying this wellhead gas.  They picked Hiedi 
because she works in the same office as Jim and they feel that she could give 
these little guys the hand holding treatment that they sometimes demand.  
Yes, it's hard to believe but it's the ones getting the $50 checks that 
complain the most.  They thought that Hiedi could also be responsible for 
making the payments.  

Anyway, that suggestion wasn't really panning out, so another suggestion has 
arisen as to setting up a whole new Enron entity that would handle the 
metered supply and we would be buying the gas from this entity.  First, we 
would have to take into consideration whether it would restrict our 
flexibility on Columbia Gas.   I'm not totally sure how to go about getting 
something like this off the ground, but it does have merit.  Another thought 
was to hire someone here that's sole responsibility would be the metered 
supply.  They would hopefully become a specialist in the area and would work 
closely with Gloria in client services, Jim Javins and John Singer.  The 
thought was to have them report either to me or to Scott Neal.  Chris and I 
tend to disagree in this area.  he thinks there is plenty of work for a full 
time person.  My opinion is that there is definitely a need for a special 
project over the course of some time, but that once the initial push to get 
the meters in is done that it is more of a part-time responsibility.  The big 
problem with that though is right now, the guys downstairs don't even have 
time to get these special type of requests done and it might be faster for 
Gloria to do them herself, if she has proper training and access to our 
systems.  However, regardless of which group gets the responsibility, there 
is going to be a need for a very large effort within the next month or so 
when January actuals come in and we should be prepared.

Any way, please give it some thought and let me know if you have any 
suggestions.  I'd also like to here what your views might be.  

Thanks!

Bob, 

After talking with Robert about this request this morning, I told him that I 
would look at future option, but that in the meantime I would go ahead and 
take care of these for Gloria.  Well, to my shock, it took over three hours 
for me to complete the task of setting up 2 deal in sitara and adding and 
pathing 9 meters in unify over the course of six months.  I'm not sure why I 
thought this, but I thought it might take 30 maybe 45 minutes.  The whole 
process is really rather simple, just very time consuming.  What scares me is 
that we are soon going to be having to do exactly this same thing for the 
hundreds of metered production wells that have come over with the CES 
acquisition.  At the current rate of business that we are doing, I just don't 
see how will be able to accomplish this with our current resources.

We still have some time before we need to make a decision, but a couple of 
possible solutions would be 1) bring in some temporary help for a short 
period of time or 2)  give Gloria access to help out with this, but then we 
give up part of the control of our systems to other group.

ED/KATHY,  Please help.  There's gotta be a way that client services can add 
these producer meters and ZERO paths that are so old or learn how to do it!  
Volumes are minimal and the TCO guys are swamped.  I'm sure the SOUTHEAST 
schedulers get the same type of request from client services or they will 
with the CES wellhead stuff.  We don't have time to do the research for this 
stuff, set up the meters and the tickets and the counterparties for little or 
no volume that's from JULY of 1999!!! HELLO That was a millenium ago!!! Can

Cindy & Chris,
 EQUITRANS FOR JULY:
1. CBE, Inc meter 11480 will be nominated by Equitable Energy,LLC  for the 
month of July.  The paper work did not get in on time to effect a transfer of 
this meter into Equitable's pool.  Equitable is buying the production from 
the producer.
2.  Power Gas Marketing & Transmission  7,500 Dth (revised to 5,000 due to 
curtailments implemented by PNG) has been sold to Equitabel Energy, LLC @ CNG 
Index  plus 2 cents.   Equitable will do a pool to pool from PMGT's pool .
3.  Envirogas, Inc meter 11445 has been shut-in by Envirogas.  Do not nom any 
volumes from this meter.
4.  The other metered production (Aurora, Braxton,& Kennedy) of 296/day.  
Unless I can sell to Equitable this AM, you will have to take to ?????  (If I 
sell to Equitable, I'm sure they will want to use there own firm transport. )

Happy 4th of July

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.


If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

Subject: EOG for July, Peoples

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this 
after the 4th.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

You're the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Heads up... Chris will be calling you about the billing/invoicing process 
that CNR does. We are trying to get the stuff set-up in Sitara.

To ensure everyone is on the same page. TCO does not consider CNR gas as an 
agency deal. TCO just allocates the wellheads to the appropriate pools. There 
may be an agency agreement between CNR and CES and now Enron. Chris will talk 
to Heidi about that.

Okay... to ensure we are all on the same page. I've talked to Jill 
Linkenauger and Heidi Griffith... and the following will be done.

Jill has forwarded to Heidi the CNR file for CES customers and their 
addresses. Jill also forwarded the appropriate form that needs to be sent to 
the producers, signed, and return to Enron.

Terry Franklin will be the Enron North America contact on the form for these 
CNR producers (Jill estimates about 50 CES producers). 

Later this week, Heidi will send the form to the CNR's CES customers. Heidi 
will put Terry's phone number and address on the form.

We will need the Appalachian Traders (John Singer, Jim Javins, Jill 
Linkenauger) to encourage the producers to sign this paper work and get it 
back to Enron ASAP. We want the change over done by April estimates.

Jill said if the change did not happen in time for April estimates, she would 
help send out the ascii file one more time. At the end of March, Jill will 
end her employment with CES... so we can't depend on her in the future months 
for this ascii file.

Thanks again for everyone's help in getting the change over done ASAP.

Phillips Production has/had two seperate PNG deals:
 1.  500 MCFD; $2.82/MCF; 1/1/00 - 6/30/00
 2.  300 MCFD;  $2.95/MCF;  1/1/00 - 11/30/00
To my knowledge, PNG does not send out production information to either the 
producer or the pool operator.  This information should be available on 
E-Script.
 Phillips gets their production volumes (which they use to create our 
invoice) from the company integrating the meter charts.  I beleive that this 
is the same information provide to PNG.

Subject: Re: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production  

Wade,  Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help 
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind 
the citygate deals  

Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate 
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and 
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of 
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to 
account for these transactions internally.

It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the 
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also 
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie 
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. 

Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in 
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???

By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!  
Please keep me abreast of the status.

Subject: Phillips Production Co - PNG City Gate Production

ENA is being invoiced by Phillips Production Company for production on  
Dominion Transmission (CNG) via Peoples Natural Gas.  This is 
behind-city-gate gas that we do not get documents supporting the volumes. I 
have invoices and production statements from Phillips.  

Per John Singer Notes Mail of 08/23 concerning the July production," Phillips 
Production / Peoples: Price:  @ $2.95/Mcf  Term:  1/1/2000 - 11/30/2000 Est. 
Volume:  500/MCFD  (Actual Volume will vary.)   I have no way of verifying 
the actual volume.  Chris Germany and Angie Zeman will try to get into CES's  
PNG pool via E-Script.  This may be the only way to verify actual volumes.  I 
have a call into Phillips to see if they might have a pipeline statement 
verifying volumes."  Joihn's call to Phillips read partially,  " I just 
talked to Sam Fragale @ Phillips.  The 7,843 Mcf @ $2.95 is ENA's. "

Our deals have been using point 20200 on Dominion Transmission (CNG).  Deals 
for Jan 00 - Mar 00 were 210359 and 210364.  These were copied to 226543 and 
229733 respectively for April 00 forward  Deal 226543 has April 00 only, but 
should probably be extended through June-00 according to deal notes from John.
Here is our current status on this gas

Prod  Invoice  Invoice  Current  
Month  Volume  Price  Unify Vol Sitara Deal 

May-00  4801  @$2.82  163  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9748  @$2.95  353  229733

June-00  5341  @$2.82  0  226543 (has April-00 only, should extend through 
June?))
  9394  @$2.95  0  229733

July-00  7843  @$2.95  9552  229733

We need to get our proccess together for handling this each month through the 
end of the deal terms.

Please direct the appropriate parties to help make these invoiced volumes 
available on the deal and in Unify so I can pay Phillips.

Thanks  WRP

Paul,

An Amendment to Appendix "C" will need to completed by both the pool that the
meters are being transferred from and the pool that the meters are being
transferred to.  I have discussed this issue with Heidi Boyd at Columbia 
Energy
and I believe she will complete this form on their behalf in order to delete 
the
meters.  You will also need to complete this form in order to add the meters 
to
Clinton's LGA pool once the Pooling Agreement has been completed and the pool
becomes effective.  I will fax the form to Heidi this morning.  It must also 
be
signed by the producer.  Please confirm your fax number (614-760-2794) and I
will be happy to fax the form to you as well.

Carol

Hi Carol,

Can you help me with the below information?  I am looking to turn over our
local production.  After August we won't be in business anymore and this local
production that is in our name is really Enron North America's local
production.   I had suggested that Enron (Chris Germany) set up a local agg
pool or if he was selling it to someone else to let me know so that we can 
turn
this production over ASAP.   I am looking to write a letter to Peoples to give
them formal intent and need to know if I need to include meter identification
numbers in the letter (currently I do not know what these numbers are).

I apologize for this being such a mess, but I have been trying to get this
cleared up and seem to have no luck.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi Karen,

Please nominate a volume of 24,800 dth's for the month of July 00 for CES'
local production.

Please let me know if you need something more from me.  I understand that
Clinton Energy is setting up a pool and will soon be able to take over our
local production.  I will be sending in a letter soon relinquishing the local
production, is there a meter number or identification number that I will need
to mention in the letter?

Thanks,

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM

get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

Chris,
This morning I sent  you a fax regarding Power Gas Marketing's May East Ohio 
contract volume.  As per the fax, this gas did not get nominated, thus Power 
Gas Marketing was "cashed out" by EOG.  Power Gas will be sending ENA an 
invoice for $3,443.15 for the difference between the contract price and the 
"cash out" price plus pooling fees.

Wade, 
You may want go get a copy of the fax and the backup I faxed to Chris, or I 
can fax a copy to you.
Has the May PMGT East Ohio invoice been paid?  

John

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Yes, CES Retail did take this gas for Jan, Feb & March.  The Canonsburg 
office was responsible for the noms.  
 Yes, the deal needs to be input into Sitata.  Maybe, Terry can input.  Wade 
has copies of the monthly invoices from T & F Operating for all three months.

Deal details:
Volume = 10,000 MCF per month
Price for Jan, Feb & Mar = $3.465 / MCF
I would not worry about the Mcf issue here.  Just put the volumes and price 
in and pay the bill.

T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.

Here is the letter and an attachment that you will need to complete to move 
the CNG meters from the CES' pools to ENA's pools.  There are some 
highlighted notes that I put on the letter that tells you what you need to 
do.    You will probably just want to attach a spreadsheet list of the meters 
that you are moving for each letter.  The list will need to include the 
producer information also.  You will need to do one of these letters for all 
the agg point pools.  I filled out everything for you on the attachment all 
you need to do is make sure you attach the appropriate list of meters.

Please call me if you have any questions.  (614) 718-6340

Heidi

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

June nomination into the pool should have been 500 Mcfd of production gas 
(from Phillips) and 7,500 Dth of pool gas from Power Gas Marketing.  You 
should check with Heidi Boyd @ CES for the actual noms into the pool.  She 
should have nominated these volumnes into CES's pool since ENA does not have 
a pool.
As far as I know, the pool to pool transfer fee is $0.04/Dth or $100.00 which 
ever is LESS.  Therefore,  for volumes over 2,500 the transfer fee should be 
$100.00 no matter what the volume is.

Phillips' contract for 500 MCFD metered production  goes through NOVEMBER 
(this volume may be less because of high line pressures).
Power Gas Marketing's contract for 7,500 Dth /Month pool to pool goes through 
OCTOBER.

If Clinton is interested in the volumes through contract expiration, I can 
ask Phillips to grant us permission to move the meters into Clinton's pool.

Attached is a list of meters that will be Gatherco stations effective 
4/1/2000.  These stations were formerly on Columbia Gas Transmission and due 
to certain lines being sold to Gatherco, will now be Gatherco stations.  
Also, these meters will all be subject to the $.25 Gatherco gathering rate.  
This list should include all the meters for Enron North American and Columbia 
Energy Services combined.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I know where I stand!....
Yes, just go ahead and ignore all those emails, and lets start over, ok....

1) What is the status of CNG Producing Company  - Deal #77755?  The contract  
was called Trag 110, 
and I see that in the service list on CNG Transmission, but it needs to be 
pathed starting 07/99 through current.
Also, the rates are showing up as:
Transportation       $.19910     but should be $.06
ACA                           $.00220     Should not be paying ACA
Compression          $.00000    Should be $.22

2)   What is the status of CNG Field Services - Deal #125711 (Marco Pipeline) 
- Coronado Pipeline  Enterprises?

I have more, but do you think that we could get these 2  taken care of 
today?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Thanks,

Subject: Rates Corrections

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

Chris,

The term ticket in TAGG is for 1500/d @ .434.  Where is the remaining volume 
so that the hedge ties.

Subject: Local Production for June

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Subject: Local Production for June

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

The metered production from Questa Petroleum is  "Behind CPA city gate".  
Questa's meter is in CES's Columbia of Pa Pool (or CDC Pool).  Heidi Boyd 
nominates this gas to the CES Retail customers each month from the pool.  
This gas is in addition to any other gas provided for CES by ENA.  Since it 
is "Behind the City Gate" no one at ENA has to nominate the physical flow of 
the gas.  The only reason a nomination needs to be made by an ENA scheduler 
is to allow payment to the producer.

 Chris Germany should be including this gas in the invoice for CES Retail.

This gas is under contract through October 2000.

John

Gloria,
I'm sorry but as a manager, I spent the vast portion of my days and evenings 
involved in trading activities, in  meetings and trying to put out fires.  I 
have also been receiving on average 2 or 3 of these requests per day and I 
usually don't even begin looking at these until 6 in the evening.  Some are 
quick fixes, but the majority lately have not been.  Todays calendar isn't 
looking much better.

I contacted Wade on this last week, but have not received anything.  I hate 
to hold you back from making your payments, which is why we have spent 
another good chunk of time justifying a new position under Carrie Hollomon to 
handle these types of requests.  That position is now to be filled by Teri 
Franklin.  I'm sure that she is not totally up to speed on everything such as 
sitara, so please continue to be patient for awhile.  

So that this whole process might be sped up a little faster, I would like to 
suggest that you obtain the pricing information from either Lashonda or Wade 
and then pass the information that you need set up in it's entirety to Teri.  
If the information is provided in it's entirety this will keep us from 
setting up deals with incorrect pricing.  Which then causes us to have to go 
back and do further rework when either Wade of Lashonda informs us of the 
error, which is exactly what I received an
email on earlier this morning.  


Teri,

If you need any help with sitara or any other type of training in setting up 
these deals, please let either myself, Victor, Chris, or Brenda know and we 
will try to answer your questions.  Thanks for your help!

Kathy

Heidi,

 Per Jim Kuhn @ Belden & Blake, the volumes contracted for for NYSEG 
production are as follows:
 APR = 216 DTH/Day
 MAY = 179 DTH/Day
 JUN = 160 DTH/Day
 JUL = 192 DTH/Day
 AUG = 195 DTH/Day
 SEP = 191 DTH/Day
 OCT = 190 DTH/Day

Does CES need these volumes??

BBC has additional volumes for sale for the period Apr/Sep.  They are trying 
to seel the gas for the entire period vx monthly.  If you have an idea what 
volumes you need monthly for Apr/Oct, I will try to purchase from BBC.  
John

FYI.  Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract.  
The meter number is not know at this time.  The well name is Goodwin and is 
located in Barbour County, West Virginia.  This meter will be behind the 
Bridgeport Agg point and is expected to do about 15 dths a day.

Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on

No home yet. May have to take to Penn Fuel.  I left a message with Equitable 
to see if they are interested in Peoples, EOG, Equitrans and Penn Fuel.
What are you going to do with the CPA.  Bary Vanderhorst w/EES might be 
interested.  If not I wll contact Equitable.

I will contact Dominion to see if they are interested in any of this gas.

Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

Subject: Re: Herald Oil & Gas Jan Actuals  

For Herald Oil & Gas, I will set up the meters on the deal with deducts and 
OOGEEP, and get the actual volumes in.  Unify will calculate the difference. 
We will pay them on actuals from here on out.  I paid them originally because 
Herald was in that stack of producers we "create"an invoice for.

Power Gas and Phillips were paid yesterday (money going out today).  Kathy 
Kelly and Chris Germany set up some buy/sell deals so we could pay them and 
bill CES.  I gave them a list of similar deals for T & F, Questa, Phoenix 
Dominion.  

I got a call from Jim Spear at CNG Field Services for some CPA gas for 
January.  I left him a message to send me the invoice he previously sent to 
CES.  I'll get a deal set up and refer it to Kathy and Chris to finsh their

For Richard Burkland and William S Burkland (both CPA), I have no 
information.  Can you supply any ?

They are still trying to get transport contracts set up for the various pipes 
for "CES" production in order to be able to path and track and balance all of 
these meters we have entered on deals.  I am sending Global Facilities a list 
of meters for initial set up in the system, meters for tax codes to be set, 
and I will be putting the OOGEEP deducts on the deals.  And last but not 
least, I am setting up and assigning statement groups (a list of parties with 
no payment addresses set up is going out to Global Counter Party shortly) so 
I can draft these statements after the volumes are put in.

In between,I am setting up some spreadsheets for CNG, CGAS, and Gatherco 
information we have received to help track payments and information. 

I need some assistance with the pricing for Kenoil , RB Robertson, Cutter 
Oil, and a question on Oxford.  Please give me a call today when you can.

Attached is the updated (as of Wednesday) spreadsheet of CES Appalachian 
Deals.

Thanks  WRP

I would say the contact is Chris Germany at ENA.  His number is 713 
853-4743.  We should be paying ENA on actual volume produced.  If not, we 
will need to make an adjustment to the prior invoices. 

Pat - we should probably talk about this.

I ask Heidi Boyd to reduce the May production noms from 800/day to 500/day.
I ask here to nominate 500/day for June.
I was unable to sell any PNG to Amerda Hess (StatOil), therefore we will be 
cashed out by PNG for June.

Just to clarify who's on first...

Any requests that relate to Appalachian transport capacity tickets will be 
sent to Terry Franklin.  This includes additional capacity tickets that need 
to be set up, changes that need to be made to existing tickets, etc.

Any requests that relate to CES Appalachian purchase deals in Sitara will be 
handled by Wade Price.  Wade will continue setting up new deals, adding 
meters to deals, adjusting prices (based on information provided by John 
Singer), etc.

Once the deal is in the supply list and the appropriate service contract 
shows up in the service list, a request will be sent to Logistics to path the 
deal.  

Please let me know if anyone sees a problem with going forward this way.  
Thanks.

Subject: Appalachian Priorities

Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian 
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and 
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation 
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry "job description" includes other tasks, 
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed 
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on 
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for 
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie

Yes, CES Retail did take this gas for Jan, Feb & March.  The Canonsburg 
office was responsible for the noms.  
 Yes, the deal needs to be input into Sitata.  Maybe, Terry can input.  Wade 
has copies of the monthly invoices from T & F Operating for all three months.

Deal details:
Volume = 10,000 MCF per month
Price for Jan, Feb & Mar = $3.465 / MCF
I would not worry about the Mcf issue here.  Just put the volumes and price 
in and pay the bill.

T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.

I called Jill Linkenauger Friday afternoon... haven't heard back. My plan is 
to talk to her and then Kevin McCracken at CNR to have this agency switch 
over by April 1st. I thought it was done... but not 100% sure.

Hey cats. Sylvia needs to know if we are agent for CES regarding CNR 
contracts. I began setting up the contracts on Friday, but she stopped me in 
the middle cuz she wants to make sure that we are setting them up correctly. 
I have 50 to 70 to set up. Please let me know what you know. - Thanks, Rob

Actually, the deal is for 773/day @ into CPA via the Carnegie-Jefferson 
interconnect.  The price is NX1 + $0.12/Dth; the contract expires 11/01/00.
 This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for  March.  
CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply.
This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract.  CPA will only operate 
the interconnect on a day-to-day basis; no firm is available.  I am to check 
with CPA to see if they will do an exchange for this gas.

12,690 MMBtu, at CPA4 at a price of IF TCO Appal + $.12.  So, it appears that

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG 
Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.  
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell 
him.


I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Subject: Re: CES Pool Gas

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

Steve,
Please see the memo below regarding T&F Operating----
The only deals I see for T&F in our original deal listing from CES were for 
T&F Exploration, LP--There were two deals.  One was at TCO W for 10,000 MMBtu 
at $2.52 through October 2000; excess at IF TCO; The other is a Transco Z6 
NNY deal for 13,500 at NYX + .63 through October 2000.  Can you check to see 
if there were any additional files sent to us at any point showing this deal 
at a price of $3.465 through March ???   Otherwise, this may be another small 
true up item.

As a side note, John Singer sent a list of various "behind the citygate" 
deals--I took his list and tried to match them with what CES sent to 
us--there were quite a few discrepancies on prices, etc.  I'll bring this 
list to you later so that you can try to match them up with your lists of 
deals.  Although I don't think the dollar impact will be that much since 
these are all small volumes, I want to be sure we had the right information 
on the deals to begin with.

is 142786 . The contract   96029913 still has the CES - T & F Operating  
party name (as does the deal).

Per John Singer, this deal is for 10000 per month @ $3.465 for  01/00 - 03/00 
, @ $2.85 for 04/00 - 10/00  .  (by the way, they billed in MCFs).  

 I need to get this paid ASAP.  Please look into this and set up the sale as 
needed..

Heidi,
Attached is a worksheet of what BBC should bill us for the March NYSEG Gas.  
This differs from you sent to Lori @ BBC  in that we are committed to take 
1,000 per day @ NYMEX plus $.61.   Therefore I allocated volumes to the 
1,000/day committment.  I will fax this to BBC.

FYI.  Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract.  
The meter number is 4371201 and is at Hastings.  This meter is gathering 
dry.  This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October.  It is estimated to produce about 30 dths a day.  Please 
forward this on to anyone that needs to schedule this gas.  I'm not real sure 
who is doing your noms on CNG.

Thanks,
Heidi

That sounds wonderful to me.

If you guys are still working on the CPA or NYSEG local, I MIGHT be able to
help with that better so please let me know.  I'm so glad you cleared this up
with Sampson!

Thanks,

Subject: Re: PNG Local Production July 00


Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300
day from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be
4,000 for the month.

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to
Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool
gas.

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

Subject:  PNG Local Production July 00


Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates
it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do
it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was
not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out
there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I
will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is
the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain 
facilities to Gatherco, Inc.  There should have been a message in Columbia 
Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your 
IPP pool 37147 effective 4/2000.  The subject for this e-mail message was 
"Appalachian Meter Allocation".  The meters listed in this e-mail will now be 
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25 
gathering rate.  Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000 
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission 
to Gatherco.  He said he is not 100% positive that they will get this 
finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time 
they release our nominations.

Gloria and Wade,

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these 
meters.  Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's $.27 
gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any 
gathering.  Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.


Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi Griffith

I created deal  225281 for Leonard Hall for the Nov99 gas in February. 
The meters are not in Global Facilities, so I set it up on the general 
IMB-508674 point for now.

Robert, can you take it from here to get it pathed (or corrected) ?  Let me 
know when completed and I will draft a payment.

Hello!

As you know, Terry Franklin is beginning to transition into the Appalachian 
coordination role.  We spent time today with Bryce Baxter, Wade Price, and 
Gloria Barkowsky to determine how best to attack the current issues.

As Job 1, we determined that Terry's time is best utilized on transportation 
contract set-up.  Of course, Terry "job description" includes other tasks, 
but at this time, this is her #1 focus.  We decided this for the following 
reasons:

1.  Deals cannot be pathed without transportation contracts set-up in SITARA.
2.  In order to pay the producers and the pipeline, the deals must be pathed 
by Logistics (zero volume paths), and volumes must by allocated (based on 
actuals) by Gloria Barkowsky, Volume Mgmt.
3.  Wade Price, Settlements, is focused on setting up SITARA deals for 
producer wellhead purchases.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks,
Carrie

Subject: Re: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ  

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

Sorry guys.  I'm still working on the February invoice to CES.  I estimate 
that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day.  
Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having.
