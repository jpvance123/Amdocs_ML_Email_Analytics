Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, 
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with the 
group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing 
configuration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and 
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just 
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will 
keep you updated.

Looks good.  I suggest eliminating the reference to Southern in the 3rd para 
(end the sentence after "operating an RTO.")(since we are going to visit with 
Southern later this week,)  Thanks.

With the first round of RTO filings and responses complete, it is a good time 
to step back and review the highs and lows that occurred in 2000 and lay out 
our plan going into 2001. 

A. 2000 Key Facts --

1. FERC CONTINUES TO RELY UPON MONOPOLIES TAKING VOLUNTARY ACTIONS.

It does not appear that FERC (in its current form) will modify its standing 
policy that RTO formation is a voluntary process designed to let 1,000 
flowers bloom.  While Enron continues to ask FERC and FERC staff to take a 
different position, we have seen no signals that anything will change.  Faced 
with this policy, as the initial RTO filings made clear, almost all utilities 
are going to fight pretty hard not to have to give up their strategic 
transmission assets.  Accordingly, most of the proposed RTOs do not remove 
the fundamental problem - the Native Load exception.

2. THE MIDWEST CAN'T MAKE UP ITS MIND ABOUT WHICH RTO IS BEST.

The MISO continues to lose its members to the Alliance RTO.  The three big 
utilities that have declared their intention to switch sides include ComEd, 
IP, and Ameren (probably 40% of total load in initial MISO).   Key problems 
for the MISO include (a) MISO's not-for-profit status (key IP claim), (b) 
parties interest in taking energy east (key ComEd need), and (c) fair 
retention of 3rd party wheeling revenues (Ameren want).    Meetings with 
regional stakeholders (public power, industrials, State PUCs) have been 
productive in terms of getting agreement that one single RTO is the preferred 
option, however we await action from the FERC.  MISO is also telling everyone 
that can listen that if the big three pull out, it probably won't continue.  
While the MISO process is very open to the public (not so with the Alliance 
RTO), neither MISO nor the Alliance RTO have progressed far enough into the 
details to fully determine if our policy objectives will be met.

3. SOUTHERN AND GRID SOUTH DID PRETTY MUCH AS EXPECTED - NOTHING.

Rather than take a major step forward, Southern and Grid South (SCANA, CP&L, 
Duke) have initially filed non-compliant RTOs.  Grid South does nothing to 
advance a market, much less provide transmission service in a 
non-discriminatory fashion.  In fact, Grid South simply takes the current 888 
OATT and "combines" the three utilities for wheeling through purposes.  

4. PJM CONTINUES TO BE FERC'S SHINING LIGHT.

PJM was the only functioning ISO that filed with FERC earlier than was 
necessary (rumor has it that FERC invited PJM to file early to set the "right 
example").  PJM declares itself to be fully in compliance with Order 2000 in 
that filing.  PJM is also expanding.  So far, Allegheny Power and DQE have 
agreed in principle to allow PJM to operate a parallel control area called 
PJM West.  In terms of market coordination, PJM has been publicly reluctant 
to get involved in working to try to integrate the tight Eastern pools (PJM, 
NYISO,  NE-ISO, and Ontario IMO).   The other pools are not getting very much 
accomplished in their efforts.  For example, NE-ISO has indicated that it 
won't have the Day-Ahead market ready until 2003 at the earliest.  

5. ERCOT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL START ITS WHOLESALE MARKET ON TIME.

ERCOT is pressured to initiate its wholesale market by the needs of retail 
access (pilot program beginning next summer).  The rules are still being 
structured.  We are working to ensure that the tight deadlines don't 
overwhelm good market structure.   Robin Kittel and Ron McNamara are leading 
our efforts and are very active.  

6. SURPRISINGLY FLORIDA IS MOVING ALONG

In a surprise move, the actions so far in Grid Florida, while certainly not 
perfect, appear to be moving in the right direction.  The FL PSC has gone 
from saying never to asking FERC for assistance in getting the rules right.  
Governor Bush has set up a task force to study wholesale competition during 
this Legislative session; Enron will be involved.

B. 2001 Steps - 

1. FOCUS THE POLITICOS ON RTOs AND ENDING THE NATIVE LOAD EXCEPTION.

FERC will have new leadership some time in early 2000 (if we can get a 
President).  Enron is developing a coordinated political plan (Capitol Hill, 
media, Administration, industry allies) to impress upon the next 
Administration and FERC Chairperson that mandates are necessary to continue 
to drive wholesale market reforms.  Without a stronger mandate, it may prove 
difficult to have functioning RTOs by the end of 2001.  More importantly, it 
will take specific policy changes at FERC or within the state during retail 
wheeling proceedings to win the Native Load exception fight.  In those RTOs 
that have determined not to agree to ending the Native Load exception, no 
amount of meetings or filings will change the parties.

2. COORDINATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS SUPPORT MORE CLOSELY WITH THE DESK.

It is our intention to have a full time person working from the Desk to 
ensure that Enron's objectives are clearly presented to the developing RTOs.  
The goal is to work alongside Christi Nicolay and the commercial teams to 
coordinate day-to-day activities of our RTO staff and make sure that no 
opportunity is missed.  This should ensure that Enron is advocating the needs 
of the commercial teams.   We continue to have at least one person dedicated 
to each RTO market.

NYISO   -  Howard Fromer
NE-ISO  -  Dan Allegretti
IMO   - Aleck Dadson
PJM  - Tom Hoatson
MISO/Alliance - Jeff Brown / Dave Mangskau
Grid South - Tom Chapman / Joe Connor
Southern  - Joe Connor
Florida  - Dan Staines
SPP  - Ron McNamara
ERCOT  - Robin Kittel

Mike Roan from New Zealand will be arriving in early January to help out.  
Luiz Maurer is coming from Brazil in June / July to also work on wholesale 
market issues.

3. PUSH INTEGRATION OF THE TIGHT NORTHEAST POOLS.

NE-ISO and NYISO are required to file their plans for RTO status on January 
15, 2001.  While these pools have signed an MOU to discuss integration 
matters, not much progress has been made to date.  Moving power between the 
pools continues to be difficult given the different protocols and scheduling 
rules.  FERC is aware of these problems.  Again, FERC has not done anything 
to mandate compliance with Order 2000.  We have deployed an additional 
resource in Houston recently to help support Enron's involvement in the tight 
pool seams issues and make sure that the Desk is being made aware of all 
developments as close to real-time as possible.

4. CONTINUE TO FIGHT IN THE TRENCHES.

The list of people above continue to have day to day responsibility for 
ensuring full coverage of all relevant meetings of each RTO.  We continue to 
advocate our agenda (to anyone that will listen).   This work is time 
consuming (much spent listening to "junk" from monopolist Transmission 
Owners) and detailed.  Enron made solid filings in response to the RTOs 
initial work and will continue to respond in a manner that best leverages our 
resources.

5. FIND THE GRID OPERATOR FOR PROJECT e-trans.

Project e-trans has resulted in a new business consortium - 
etransconsortium.com.  This combination of APX, Cal PX, and Alstom ESCA has 
developed the necessary pieces of software and systems to provide the "market 
front-end" for any RTO (e.g., day-ahead market, transmission exchange, 
etc.).  Enron has also finished drafting a detailed tariff that incorporates 
our policy objectives.  We are now turning our attention to finding the right 
Grid Operator.  We are in discussions with National Grid, American 
Transmission Company, MISO, and PJM (although they may want to do something 
very similar).  The goal remains the same -- to have a fully functioning 
entity that can provide turnkey solutions to any Transmission Owner and use 
this entity to leverage FERC to take more dramatic action.  I will be taking 
a larger role in this activity as it moves forward in 2001.

6. DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE NEED FOR MORE RETAIL ACCESS AND GENERATION 
DIVESTITURE

Government Affairs also will continue to attempt to drive additional markets 
through direct access and divestiture.  It will take (1) non-discriminatory 
transmission access, (2) retail choice, and (3) generation divestiture to 
enable a fully thriving wholesale market.  Of course, additional market 
openings face the political questions raised due to the crisis in California.

I hope this helps put some framework around our activities.  If anyone wants 
to discuss this in more detail, I'd be happy to meet individually or as a 
group.

Jim

Attached is a summary of the New York RTO Order issued by FERC late 
yesterday. I apologize for the length, but I wanted to include a number of 
quotes from the Order that repeat arguments that we have been making over the 
past few years. In a procedural Order issued today, FERC has scheduled the 
Northeast mediation process to begin next Thursday, July 19th.

At yesterday's FERC meeting the Commission voted out an order in the Alliance 
RTO proceeding.  This is another example how the new Commission, changed with 
two new members, can put more teeth in the RTO process.  The order requires 
Alliance to establish an independent board to make all the business decisions 
for the RTO until final approval for the RTO is granted.  Further, the order 
directs that a stakeholder advisory committee should advise the independent 
board.  FERC is concerned that business decisions prior to implementation of 
the Alliance RTO are made solely by the Alliance Companies.  The order 
directs Alliance Companies to decide which alternative business plans they 
intend to implement and file with the FERC within 45 days.  

Commissioner Massey issued a concurrence with the order in which he argues 
for the establishment of a mediation proceeding (like Northeast and 
Southeast) to direct the two RTOs - Alliance and MISO - to work to develop a 
single Midwest RTO.  Though Massey did not get any other votes for this 
process now, Commissioners Wood,  Brownell and Hebert, seemed to support the 
objective of single regional RTOs in the four main regions of the country, 
including NE, SE, MW and West.

Although no commitments were made, it is quite possible that FERC will order 
a mediation-type proceeding (as in NE and SE) if the Alliance RTO does not 
expand its scope in the near future.

Subject: RTO Update

Christi, my 2 weekly RTO/ISO update is attached.

MISO

Enron had a big win in MISO during June.  The MISO CMWG (Congestion 
Management Working Group) met during June to discuss and agree on a set of 
principles that will guide day 2 CM deliberation.  In summary the principles 
mirror Enron's market design framework (the draft principles are attached).  
The key changes from MISO's model of last November are (and the key changes 
that will benefit Enron):

- Full LMP model to assist real time dispatch (across all control areas).  
There is ongoing discussion about delegation of MISO responsibilities to 
control area operators.
- No balancing requirement in the day ahead market.  Participants will have 
choice about whether they balance generation and load commitments ahead of 
time or use the 'spot' or balancing market.
- Forward instruments based on actual dispatch patterns rather than forecast 
patterns minimising uplift charges.  There is ongoing discussion on the type 
of instrument (ie FGR/FTR or some combination).

I continue to work with a small group of likeminded parties to ensure that 
these principles are realised in market design (the group appears to have a 
majority vote on the CMWG).  The real remaining risk is that transmission 
owners will veto and decisions made within the CMWG.  To minimise this risk I 
am beginning meetings with the large transmission companies to educate them 
on the benefits of the proposal beginning with Cinergy mid July.



ARTO

There is less likelihood of success in ARTO.  As noted previously the only 
forum that Enron has to change he ARTO day 2 CM framework is the MDAG (Market 
Development Advisory Group).  This group does not have any decision rights 
within ARTO's formal structure but will have an impact if it can reach 
consensus. My current goal is to obtain this concensus.  However, many 
participants are ARTO management committee member companies and they have 
firm views (somewhat misplaced at times but firm).  Anyway the MDAG met and i 
gave a day 2 CM framework presentation to the group.  Even in overview form 
this presentation was to complex for most of the attendees.  However this was 
intentional as it gives me the opportunity to call each participant and 
arrange to meet with them informally to further discuss and educate them on 
the benefits of the framework.  ARTO are very well organised and manage their 
support base on these issues well.

I am also working with ARTO (and Enron trading people) to ensure that they 
are concentrating on day 1 market operation by 15/12/01 and that they have 
educational and interface plans that will ensure an orderly transfer to the 
new environment.  On this front ARTO appear very disorganised and the 
perception is that they will have difficulty meeting the proposed 
implementation date.

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we 
expected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to 
satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The 
Commission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and 
its neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and 
configuration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a 
lack of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they 
failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or 
what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order 
states that the Commission favors the development of large, regional 
transmission organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission 
indicates that they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the 
order requires the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in 
settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these 
meetings will start next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope 
characteristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach 
to focus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The 
order states, "We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in 
the Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible."  
The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may be 
more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market 
development, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower 
wholesale electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the 
mediation as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is 
starting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other 
aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion 
managment, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, 
I am attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the 
order is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs 
are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  
Therefore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and 
file a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

Steve --

If still ok, I think that we should try and establish the date for the 
Southern - Enron meeting per Joe's message below.  It would be good to hear 
their viewpoints (just to know where they are coming from).

Subject: Re: Southern  RTO  

I met with Andy Dearman and Bill Newman of Southern on Friday.  They talked 
about what is going on with the non-jurisdictional utilities that have signed 
a MOU to develop a RTO.  The group has met a couple of times to discuss the 
process they will use.  Confidentiality agreements have been signed, so no 
details are available, but they have agreed to a voting structure for the 
development.  Southern has about one third of the votes (and 65%of the 
assets) and it takes at least two other parties agreeing with Southern to 
carry a vote.  Southern says they spent a lot of time convincing the other 
parties that Southern was not going to run, or dominate, the process.  After 
that, Southern said the group started to pull together and get organized for 
the development.  

They said everyone in the group appeared to be ready to find ways to make the 
RTO work and resolve the hurdles the non-jurisdictional utilities have been 
expressing with the development of other RTOs.  They said there were some 
rough spots that had to be resolved and they couldn't be sure agreement would 
be reached, but at this point there was a lot of cooperation. 

Andy and Bill wanted to convince me that this was not a delaying tactic by 
Southern and they were doing everything possible to ensure that a complete 
RTO filing could be ready by 12/15/01.  They also said they thought this is 
what Ed Holland wanted to discuss with Steve Kean.  

We talked about how other stakeholders could have input to the development.  
They said that it was too early to make any commitment, but the group had 
started thinking about it and they expected an input process to be available 
by late summer. 
They said Southern was in favor of some process that would provide 
stakeholders the opportunity to look at what was being considered and advise 
the development group as early as possible.  They said they understood the 
difficulty stakeholders had with the approach Southern used in its initial 
filing and wanted to do it different, but they pointed out again that 
Southern could not dictate the process that would be allowed by the group.  
In the meantime, they said if we wanted to provide position papers on any 
part of the RTO development they would make sure the papers were circulated 
in the group or we could continue to hold bilateral discussions with them or 
other members of the development group.

Jim, I still think it would be worthwhile to have a meeting between Ed and 
Steve Kean, and I would include you and invite Andy and Bill to come.  I 
don't think they want to discuss anything technical at this point; they just 
want to convince Enron that the approach Southern is taking provides the 
quickest development of a RTO for the Southern area, and they want any help 
we can give in convincing FERC to let this process run.  

I also think we need to pass on filing a response to Southern's May 15th 
status report, either alone or with Alabama Municipal Electric Authority ( 
Donna, I guess that's who you meant in the memo below, since AEC has signed a 
MOU with Southern?).  I will get in touch with Bob Reilley to find out why we 
haven't heard from EPSA on its filing.  I still think that's the best 
approach.

		 Subject: Southern  supplemental status report

I am attaching the supplemental status report that Southern filed in its 
RT01-77 on June 20.  They have included MOUs with Georgia Transmission Corp, 
Santee Cooper and Alabama Electric Coop to work on development of an RTO.  
These are really general, more of the same of what we've seen from Southern.

Also we had talked  about possible comments on the May 15 Southern filing; 
Coral was working on comments through EPSA.  Nothing has been filed by EPSA 
yet.  

Alabama did file comments on the May 15 status report and they have asked 
that the FERC establish a technical conference to "publicly air and evaluate 
the alleged governance concerns and the concerns regarding significant 
delay..."  Following a technical conference, they ask for a judge to convene 
a settlement conference at FERC to "undertake a properly supervised and 
serious development of an RTO for the SE without further wasted time."

At this point we could consider filing comments in support of the Coop 
comments.

Attached is the proposed protest that EPMI would file next Monday 11/20 
against FPL in its request for continuation of market based rates for its 
wholesale merchant function and affiliates.  EPMI has already filed detailed 
protests (unlike the attached generic protest) against AEP, Entergy and 
Southern due to problems with each utility's OASIS system.  EPMI plans to 
file this generic protest in other large vertically integrated utility 
requests for continuation of market based rates.  The attachment now includes 
a reference to Staff's investigation that states participation in an RTO, 
without the proper safeguards, including the elimination of the native load 
exception, will not necessarily reduce the utilities' ability to discriminate 
against third parties.  Plus, there is a reference that Staff found a 
perception that the SE is the worst area for discriminatory practices.

Please let me know if you have an issue with EPMI making this filing in FPL's 
proceeding.

Also, note:  EPMI plans to file this generic protest this Thursday in the 
current RTO proposals -- SPP, Entergy transco, Florida RTO, Southern, Grid 
south.  Then on Monday 11/20, EPMI will be filing its specific protests of 
other aspects of each RTO filing.

Yesterday, at the Midwest ISO, we successfully managed to quash the MISO's 
"at least one source-to-sink reservation" proposal.

MISO has been attempting to figure out a way to do security analysis on 
transmission reservations, and felt that the Entergy Source/Sink policy was 
too restrictive, but the policy of not requiring source-to-sink at any point 
was too relaxed.  Their proposal was that "at least one" reservation on a 
tag/schedule must have the true source-to-sink; otherwise, the tag/schedule 
would be denied for improper use.

Representatives from CINergy, Duke, Dynegy, ACES, Ameren and LG&E worked with 
me to fight this concept, arguing that it was effectively identical to the 
Entergy Source/Sink policy in almost all cases.  After a meeting and two 
conference calls, in which the MISO ignored our comments and continually 
pressed for their option, we finally managed to convince them that it was 
unacceptable.  

The new policy that MISO is planning to operate under is as follows:

 1.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
specified accurate source and sink, the tag/schedule will be approved.
 2.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
did NOT specify accurate source and sink, but analysis indicates the 
transaction can flow without compromising reliability, the tag/schedule will 
be approved
 3.) If, at the time a transaction is tagged/scheduled, the MISO reservation 
did NOT specify accurate source and sink, and analysis indicates the 
transaction cannot flow without compromising reliability (i.e., the 
transaction will cause or contribute to a constraint), the tag/schedule will 
be denied

While this is not as unrestrictive as we might want, it allows us a great 
deal more flexibility that the Entergy Source/Sink barrier while at the same 
time allaying the MISO's reliability concerns.  Effectively, this allows us 
to redirect both firm and non-firm at the time of tagging/scheduling without 
a loss in transmission priority.  Not only will this give us more flexibility 
within MISO, but the MISO intends to sell it to the Alliance as well under 
the IRCA.  

This also can give us a cornerstone in proving to the FERC that the Entergy 
S/S policy is not required for reliability, as other entities are able to 
meet reliability goals without the stifling limits Entergy claims are 
necessary.

As an aside, we are also pressing the MISO for a Redirection policy that will 
allow for "partial" redirects of service on a short term basis (the Separate 
proposal referenced in the attached document).  This will allow us to 
accomplish the same goals as the new MISO policy, but reduce the availability 
risk by allowing us to redirect prior to the time the transaction is 
tagged/scheduled.  These two proposals, when combined, will allow us for much 
more flexible uses of transmission without ignoring the reliability mantra 
providers chant whenever we ask for innovation and change. 

A detailed write-up of the work accomplished is attached.  Proposal 4, 
Discussion item "Confusing POR/POD Naming," Discussion Item "MISO Proposal  
...time of scheduling," and the Resolutions should be of primary interest to 
those wishing to see more detail on the directions MISO is heading.

Attached are some brief ideas that I thought we could discuss at our 
requested Rick-meeting.  I tried to reflect things I heard Larcamp say, plus 
the idea that Kevin had for an RTO-group.  (Rick--Jim and I talked about 
these on the phone today).

(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition 
market based rates on RTO participation.

GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the "voluntary" nature 
of Order No. 2000.
Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is 
premature due to Southern's "significant progress" in developing an RTO.  
Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating 
that the Investigation is based on "perception," not fact, and contains 
conclusions that are "ill-formed."  Southern concludes that the "Southeastern 
bulk power market worked quite well" this summer because there were no price 
spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge 
stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first.

(2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO 
filing in abeyance:

Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day 
period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and 
additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will 
provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the 
conclusion of the this period.  

(3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order 
request that it can be an RTO

States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about 
spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate 
transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.)

(4)  GridSouth response to protests

It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership 
structure of the LLC
GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the 
West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined 
Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing 
Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission 
system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking 
by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an 
OATT?)
Grid South will file interconnection procedures by 2/01.

Kevin --

Attached is the East Power RTO Status Matrix as of 12.8.00.  I think that 
we've captured almost all issues (although we may need attributes to add or 
change as we move forward).  

Additionally, given that this is the first time we've put out the matrix, the 
regional people need to confirm the proper response to each attribute (so 
some things may change as I confirm the responses).  As the RTOs are so 
undefined in many cases, we are using our judgement as appropriate.

Hope this is helpful.   My thought is to re-fresh monthly.

Jim

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
            Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: June 29, 2001

RE: Draft Letter to FERC Commissioners Regarding Alliance
      RTO Stakeholder Process and Interconnection Agreement

Attached is a draft letter addressed to the FERC Commissioners concerning the 
collaborative stakeholder process of the Alliance RTO (ARTO).  As you are 
aware, EPSA sent a letter in April to the ARTO transmission owners outlining 
our concerns with the development of the ARTO stakeholder process.  The ARTO 
subsequently made its compliance filing to FERC in May describing the 
progress of the collaborative stakeholder process.  Many parties filed 
comments outlining the flawed progress and their inability to provide 
meaningful stakeholder input to the ARTO.

Most recently, the ARTO removed all system upgrade transmission crediting 
provisions from the latest draft Interconnection Agreement and 
Interconnection Procedures covered during the June 7-8, 2001 collaborative 
meeting.  We are concerned that such an action will have grave effects on 
generation and is clearly inconsistent with FERC precedent.  We are also 
concerned with the ARTO's commitment to uphold its interests in the Inter-RTO 
Cooperation Agreement ("Cooperation Agreement") to form a common pro forma 
Generator Interconnection Agreement with the MISO.

We intend to send the letter to the FERC Commissioners as well as all parties 
in the active docket.  The letter will be signed by EPSA, but if individual 
generators would also like to sign on, please let us know.  If you have any 
comments, please contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or at eperrigo@epsa.org 
by noon EST on Tuesday, July 3rd.

Rick  -- Attached is my list of rehearing issues for the Southern and 
GridSouth RTO orders that you requested. 

   

Also included are summaries of GridSouth and Southern Orders.

  

Jim, Tom and Christi -- Please send these to others that you think would like 
to see them.  Also, call me if you would like to discuss.
