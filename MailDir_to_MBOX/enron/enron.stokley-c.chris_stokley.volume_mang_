Charge types 402, 403 and 404 have been fully re-allocated and are set to A.  

Finals for the regular stuff have been completed; incomplete actualization found for 9/5 and will need to be re-run on Monday.  Data had not been set to M as the allocations were not correct.  Did not discuss the date with Brett.

Charge type 405 (Import Deviation) is being re-run, with exceptions created that will require manual allocations.  The volume is still not allocating properly and research must be done to determine what is causing the bad allocations.  I may need some help looking at the data, if help can be found.

What is outstanding for Prelim actualization:
Finish 405 allocations, upload to Oracle, and set them to A.
Run Total 407 to assign remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA.
Run entire process, comparing A's to F's for Finals
Upload Finals to Oracle and set to M
Re-run 9/5 Final
Run Flash reports for A and M to double-check a match to the Invoices.

Still shooting for a COB Tuesday for all.

We have transferred new allocations for Gen and Export Dev based on the changes to the formula that I gave to TJ.  Tomorrow we will work on redoing Load Dev using the same formula changes, then we need to finish researching whatever is wrong with Import Deviation and get that one done.  

Once all four are done and transferred, then we can do the Total 407 part, which will identify remaining dollar variances and allocate that amount to ECTstCA.  The code hasn't been fully tested yet, so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday.

I am finished with September Finals for the non-deviation stuff through the 28th, and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning.

I anticipate having all of September completely actualized (for both Preliminary and Final) by cob Tuesday.

TJ looking into the formulas, with Anna's assistance as best she can by telephone and IM.  We had to dump the existing export deviation records and re-do the manuals that had been previously added incorrectly, so that type will have to be run through the process again for sure.

No additional progress on any of the other things that need to be done for September, with the exception of 3 days worth of Finals actualized without deviations.

Tomorrow is another day, and if Anna is back we'll get that much closer to completion of Prelims by weeks' end.  At least we didn't have a database crash today.

Continue to have difficulties matching up volumes for Import Deviation, caused by an internal database functionality problem.  

Have analyzed the Instructed/Uninstructed settlement data provided by the ISO and created formulas for variance identification and allocation for all types of deviation, as well as special case handling (exceptions or export deviation for example).  Also looking into Region differences and working with Anna on how to incorporate region into the process.

Anna has added the functionality to be able to actualize by settlement file SeqID, but this needs to be tested (settlement database crash prohibited proper testing today).

Reviewed TJ's functionality for allocating dollar variances in Total 407 (after volumetric and related dollar variances are allocated, remaining dollar variances are applied to ECTstCA); provided feedback on same.

Review formulas currently in database - revise if needed
Test formulas
Obtain valid allocations for variances (especially for 405)
Check results on new allocations for 402, 403 and 404 to see if formula changes made any difference, and if so, is difference good
Delete existing allocations (based on current formulas, may be invalid)
Send new allocations up to FSP
Run total 407
Re-run whole process for Finals
Finish Final actualizations (Brett left off at the 19th)

Anticipate completion of deviation stuff for Prelims complete by end of week, and finals by Tuesday next.

Pete,

I called Glenna and she informed me that they are no longer in Folsom but are in Alhambra.  Apparently an email was sent to you and Chris in regards to this, but I am not on this distribution list.  

The new IP address is 166.49.55.18.  

Chris will need to resend yesterday's Load meter files and I will need to pull the meter files. 

Please Chris or myself a call when you get back in the office so we can get this squared away.

Thanks,

KN

Chris & Kourtney,

I think the ISO Meter system is not working.  I even tried running the Meter Scout manually and the confirmation still times out.

Contact Glenna and find out what is going on. 

 I'm leaving for a funeral this morning so I'll be out of the office and pager range.  You can reach me by cell, 409-656-6219.

Dear Traders,  

  I am seeing a trend that I am trying to get my hands around for clarity.
  It seems that of late, I have been seeing more ancillary charges being enforced for transmission deals.
  Charges range for Voltage, wheeling losses, loss energy, loss capacity, scheduling fees, etc.  
  Before, it seemed that with wheeling losses, the overalll price for tranny averaged $3 - $6 per MWh.  Now, it seems that that    price has gone up to $9 or more per MWh, once all ancillary charges have been applied.   

  Cara and I are working on a comprehensive excel document that will show you all of the charges that could be assessed when you purchase and wheel transmission. We hope to have this updated soon.

  Until then, I have been handing out summaries as I receive information.  I will continue to put information in your boxes or give it to you in our weekly meetings.

  Thanks for your attention,

  Virginia

Pat,

This e-mail is to follow up on our phone conversation for Meter Data on 4/19, PGES zone SDG1.

The average for this zone runs around 717, that day meter for that zone is 444.13.

Looking for your investigative answer!

Jim, I left you a message regarding 3/25 settlement file.  The original

Also, could you please add the associated charge codes to the description. Then go back and audit the document by cross checking the number of ISO charge types vs. what you have been given in the document. The final document should have all charge types that the ISO currently has in place.

Details of Changes:

The changes to SettleSupp were in the rate formula.  The original formula said, :"=IF(AK4>0,Curves!i49,Curves!I42), which means that if the volume in AK4 is greater than zero, use the Inc (I49 reference) price, otherwise use the Dec (I42 reference).  The problem was that the references were backwards, so I switched them to be . . .Curves!I42,Curves!I49.  That made the correct price come in.

This affected the 405 part of SettleSupp only, no other charges were modified.

For 403, the rate formula was "=IF(AK20<0,CURVES!I81,CURVES!i88" which means that if the deviation volume was less than zero, use the Inc, otherwise use the Dec.  I changed it so that it reads . . .(AK20>0,CURVES!i81. . .) so that it would use the Inc if the dev volume is greater than zero.  I confirmed that the dev volume calcs were correct first.

In all of my test runs, both of these changes pulled in the correct Inc or Dec rate, and applied it to the correct dev volume.

All,
	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.  Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.  
	The CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002.  They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volumes are, thus reducing the amount of megawatts they can effectively spread out their GMC charges over.  
	I have the following observations:  1.  Despite the decrease in volumes, and the decrease in overall market activity, the CAISO has no plans to reduce its current workforce of 500+ employees.  2.  When posed the question: Is CERS charged GMC for out of market energy?  Their answer was circumspect at best.   3.  The CAISO currently does not assess GMC charges to ancillary service volumes, they indicated however that they are strongly considering changing this policy to increase the denominator that they can spread out GMC.  
	The CAISO would also like to point out that these increases are worse case scenarios, and may not be this high.  But as we are all aware, in the California energy market, the worst-case scenario ends up looking optimistic in comparison to what actually ends up happening.  Below is a detailing of the changes.  

-Kit

Charge Code	Description	Current Rate	Proposed New Rate	Percentage Increase	
521	Control Area Services Charge	$0.4060 	$0.5140 	27%	
522	Inter-zonal Scheduling Charge	$0.2230 	$0.3080 	38%	
523	Market Operations Charge	$0.9510 	$1.6080 	69%

Hi Jennifer,

Sorry this took so long.  We experienced problems while running the October 2000 numbers.  I've attached spreadsheets which include the Load Deviation numbers for production months September, November and December 2000 for both EES and PGES.   I will forward October as soon as calculations are done.

Please note that the numbers have not been actualized.  The spreadsheets are draft quality and are for information purposes only.  Please let me know if you need any additional information or have any questions.  I can be reached at 503-703-8402 (mobile).

Thanks,
Donna Sheidun

Chris,

FYI:  Harbor's October wire will be going out tomorrow in the amount that Foster noted below.  Melissa and I confirmed these numbers.  And Caroline went over the November numbers with Foster as well.  So I think we are getting the process down!

Hope you're having fun!  :)

Confirming our discussion, there are 2 things that I want to make sure happen Monday and Tuesday this week:

1.  Harbor gets paid for Oct.  The amount is      $185,631.78 
2.  Caroline is going to get me final numbers for Nov. Harbor so I can put in the Services Desk Profit Annuity.

Anna, 

I am missing some manual entries that I made.  For 12/8/00, I made some manual entries for Willamette and I see them in the Del do not open qyr for Trans type D and E, but not for C.  I was under the impression, that EPMIM's could be saved as D's, E's etc, but that they would always stay as a C.  I also see the same problem for ECTRT on 12/11/00.    

Please let me know how I should proceed or if there is anything else you need from me--or if I should contact someone else??

Thanks,

Kourtney

course the Imbalance Energy (CT 401) and Excess Energy, CT 481.

Keoni,

	I realize that there are no penalty charges associated to Load,
I am referring to the neg. and positive load deviation. What are all of
the charges associated to the penalties for deviation from schedule.

	Ps  Jim, take your best cut at what you think these charges are
and then get Keoni too sign off on what results you come up with. We
need to put every charge that we think is linked to a schedule and then
just have Keoni fill in the gaps and sign off on the document.

We have transferred new allocations for Gen and Export Dev based on the changes to the formula that I gave to TJ.  Tomorrow we will work on redoing Load Dev using the same formula changes, then we need to finish researching whatever is wrong with Import Deviation and get that one done.  

Once all four are done and transferred, then we can do the Total 407 part, which will identify remaining dollar variances and allocate that amount to ECTstCA.  The code hasn't been fully tested yet, so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday.

I am finished with September Finals for the non-deviation stuff through the 28th, and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning.

I anticipate having all of September completely actualized (for both Preliminary and Final) by cob Tuesday.

TJ looking into the formulas, with Anna's assistance as best she can by telephone and IM.  We had to dump the existing export deviation records and re-do the manuals that had been previously added incorrectly, so that type will have to be run through the process again for sure.

No additional progress on any of the other things that need to be done for September, with the exception of 3 days worth of Finals actualized without deviations.

Tomorrow is another day, and if Anna is back we'll get that much closer to completion of Prelims by weeks' end.  At least we didn't have a database crash today.

Subject:	Deviation Actualization Update

Continue to have difficulties matching up volumes for Import Deviation, caused by an internal database functionality problem.  

Have analyzed the Instructed/Uninstructed settlement data provided by the ISO and created formulas for variance identification and allocation for all types of deviation, as well as special case handling (exceptions or export deviation for example).  Also looking into Region differences and working with Anna on how to incorporate region into the process.

Anna has added the functionality to be able to actualize by settlement file SeqID, but this needs to be tested (settlement database crash prohibited proper testing today).

Reviewed TJ's functionality for allocating dollar variances in Total 407 (after volumetric and related dollar variances are allocated, remaining dollar variances are applied to ECTstCA); provided feedback on same.

Need to accomplish the following  to wrap-up September:

Review formulas currently in database - revise if needed
Test formulas
Obtain valid allocations for variances (especially for 405)
Check results on new allocations for 402, 403 and 404 to see if formula changes made any difference, and if so, is difference good
Delete existing allocations (based on current formulas, may be invalid)
Send new allocations up to FSP
Run total 407
Re-run whole process for Finals
Finish Final actualizations (Brett left off at the 19th)

Anticipate completion of deviation stuff for Prelims complete by end of week, and finals by Tuesday next.

Subject:	Question about Instructed/Uninstructed Energy Data Usage

Keoni,

We are, still, struggling to fully understand the Instructed/Uninstructed Energy data (IE), specifically the two columns that report Uninstructed Deviation and Uninstructed Energy.

The volumetric totals in one of these two columns is supposed to match the volume in the Settlement Detail file for Charge Type 407.  However, I have discovered a couple of (annoying) things in September:

In comparing the two columns within the table - 
For LocationTypes L and C, there is no volumetric difference between the two columns.

For LocationType G, there is a volumetric difference of 153.15 (more in the Deviation column than in the Energy column)

In comparing IE to the Settlement Statement data - 
When I use the volumes in the Uninstructed Energy column for all LocationTypes, I have a volumetric difference of 10.52 (less in the IE data).
However, when I use the Uninst Energy column for L and C, and the Deviation column for G, I then have a volumetric difference of 142.63 (less in the Settlement Statement Detail data).

My question is two- or several-fold:

What causes the volumes in the two columns to be different for the G type?  I could find no discernable value to make it change anywhere in the data.
Which column has the values that the ISO uses in determining the total net position for EPMI?
Why don't the two sets of volumes match (IE to Settlement)?

I really need to understand this, as we are required to tie all of our customer's volumes back to the Settlement Statement file, and, again, when the backup file doesn't match or is inconsistent, that makes our goals that much harder to achieve.

Caroline

Chris,

I believe that you know what things have come up in our dealings with Godfrey, but I wanted to reiterate them via email.

-We send out wires on the 25th for each of the generators energy payments from the prior month.  I sent an email to Audrey and Godfrey stating the amounts to be paid on the 13th.  Normal procedure is for Audrey to send an email to each of the customers prior to the wire in order for their A/R to prepare for them.  Audrey gave Godfrey the contact list that I had created for her.  Godfrey sent emails to customers on the 24th, but there were two emails that went to wrong customers.   Thus payment amounts were given to wrong customers.  I believe that this was due to a tech person working on his email but obviously not something to be repeated next month.

This is the major dealing that I have had thus far w/ Godfrey.  He has always been really concerned about getting things right when I've talked with him.  So I think that he really wants to do a good job but he just really does not have enough knowledge yet to do a good job.  

I will be working w/ Chris Foster to pay Harbor for July, August and September activity.  I will let you know how that goes.

We have all but the last of the exceptions actualized for 405.  TJ is writing code to take the customer search up to the day level and automatically allocate these records.  There is one day with a 35MW difference between the variance and the allocations - I will chase that down and fix it in the morning.

I have the last of the numbers ready to send to Seattle, showing the breakout between us and them.  There was a swing of about 104k in Import Deviation - we estimated a charge of about 15k, and the final actualization shows a credit of approximately 88k.  Of that credit, roughly 84k belongs to Seattle.  I will e-mail the document to Steve in the morning.

Once the 405's are fully actualized, we will transfer them to Oracle, set them to A, then run the Total 407 process (allocates remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA) for Prelims.  Set the newest actualizations to A, run a Flash and do the last cross-check to the Invoice.

For Finals, we have seven days to run through the actualization process, then transfer to Oracle, set to M, and run a Final flash.  We will then be able to provide details to Houston Settlements.

Anticipate completion of Preliminaries and Finals by mid-Thursday.

Charge types 402, 403 and 404 have been fully re-allocated and are set to A.  

Finals for the regular stuff have been completed; incomplete actualization found for 9/5 and will need to be re-run on Monday.  Data had not been set to M as the allocations were not correct.  Did not discuss the date with Brett.

Charge type 405 (Import Deviation) is being re-run, with exceptions created that will require manual allocations.  The volume is still not allocating properly and research must be done to determine what is causing the bad allocations.  I may need some help looking at the data, if help can be found.

What is outstanding for Prelim actualization:
Finish 405 allocations, upload to Oracle, and set them to A.
Run Total 407 to assign remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA.
Run entire process, comparing A's to F's for Finals
Upload Finals to Oracle and set to M
Re-run 9/5 Final
Run Flash reports for A and M to double-check a match to the Invoices.

Still shooting for a COB Tuesday for all.

TJ looking into the formulas, with Anna's assistance as best she can by telephone and IM.  We had to dump the existing export deviation records and re-do the manuals that had been previously added incorrectly, so that type will have to be run through the process again for sure.

No additional progress on any of the other things that need to be done for September, with the exception of 3 days worth of Finals actualized without deviations.

Tomorrow is another day, and if Anna is back we'll get that much closer to completion of Prelims by weeks' end.  At least we didn't have a database crash today.

Subject:	Deviation Actualization Update

Continue to have difficulties matching up volumes for Import Deviation, caused by an internal database functionality problem.  

Have analyzed the Instructed/Uninstructed settlement data provided by the ISO and created formulas for variance identification and allocation for all types of deviation, as well as special case handling (exceptions or export deviation for example).  Also looking into Region differences and working with Anna on how to incorporate region into the process.

Anna has added the functionality to be able to actualize by settlement file SeqID, but this needs to be tested (settlement database crash prohibited proper testing today).

Reviewed TJ's functionality for allocating dollar variances in Total 407 (after volumetric and related dollar variances are allocated, remaining dollar variances are applied to ECTstCA); provided feedback on same.

Need to accomplish the following  to wrap-up September:

Review formulas currently in database - revise if needed
Test formulas
Obtain valid allocations for variances (especially for 405)
Check results on new allocations for 402, 403 and 404 to see if formula changes made any difference, and if so, is difference good
Delete existing allocations (based on current formulas, may be invalid)
Send new allocations up to FSP
Run total 407
Re-run whole process for Finals
Finish Final actualizations (Brett left off at the 19th)

Anticipate completion of deviation stuff for Prelims complete by end of week, and finals by Tuesday next.

Hey, just wanted to clarify the capping in the new order--

--During non-emergency hours, the region-wide cap is at 85% of the highest price bid during the last Stage 1 emergency.

--During emergency hours, the price mitigation rules are the same--based on the operating costs of the least-efficient generator

Good to chat with you this morning, I hope that things start to look up soon!  I'll keep my fingers crossed.

Dear Chris,

Just a reminder that I will need 1/2 of a personal day this Wednesday 5-2-01.  I'll be in the office until about noon.

My mother's graduation is this weekend also, so I was wondering if it is OK that I will not be in the office on Monday 5--7-01, as I will be in Atlanta over the weekend.

Please let me know if there is anything that you need from me before that time.

Thanks,

Virginia

Dear Chris,

This e-mail is to let you know that I will need to be out of the office on a personal matter for part or all of the day on Wednesday, May 2, 2001.  

I will also be in attendance of my sister's graduation in Massachusetts from May 25, 2001 thru May 29, 2001 , returning to work on Wednesday, May 30, 2001.  (That is Labor Day weekend, so I will miss only 2 business days)

Please let me know if there is anything I can prepare for you before that time.

Exception handling coding changes are nearly complete.  TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

For the regular actualizations, I have set 10/1 - 10/18 (except 10/16) to M today.  There is a strange anomaly going on on the 16th, and neither Donna nor I could figure out what.  I will get back to it.

Anticipate completion of all by Monday, May 7.

Caroline

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

Scotty,
    Below is all of the emails between Bob Buckingham (LP), and Godfrey (Houston settlements).  This is entirely unacceptable how Godfrey and Settlements ignored this.  Bob has been waiting for three months on a resolution to a six month old issue.  Bob should have been notified by Melissa Ratnala of Godfrey's departure and the account should have been handed off to someone else.  I will be forwarding this to Melissa and ask her to address it immediately.  I am copying everyone in the group who deals with settlements to keep them informed.  The Houston Settlements saga continues.

John,
We're having a difficult time resolving a discrepancy with Enron on our February billing (we were overcharged $8,300).  I've forwarded several requests to Godfrey Hyde (Houston) with little or no response.  Also, we have not done July's "check out" as of this date.  Godfrey has been the individual of late that has usually contacted me and taken care of that.  Technically that means that Enron is unable to invoice us for July, until that is done.
 
Can you shed some light on the issue(s).  Is Godfrey still handling LP from an accounting standpoint? I'm including the pertinent e-mails to date.
 
Thanks,
 
Bob Buckingham

Godfrey, (Enron)
It's been nearly six months since the February billing error and three months since we began investigation of it.  Is there a problem in us being able to resolve this one way or the other?  Please advise me ASAP of your progress or actions to know if we need to get others involved.  Also, I've yet to hear from you on July's "check out" for our Missoula facility.  I'm assuming you guys want to bill us some time soon.  Please contact me at my new number below on both of the above issues.

Subject: Louisiana-Pacific Missoula - Descrepancy in February 01 Billing


Godfrey, (Enron)    
Per our phone conversation of today, we've discovered a potential overcharge situation in our February '01 settlement numbers for this location.
 
Enron billed us as follows:
4,590 total MWhs sold Enron to LP (@ $48 - $220,320)
288 total MWhs sold back LP to Enron (@ $177.74 = $51,189.73)
That adds up to total MWhs for the month of February: 4,878
 
The descrepancy occurs when you verify the total available MWhs for the month was only 4,704 (7MW x 24hrs x 28 days)
If I'm correct, that means we were overcharged for 174 MWhs @ $48/MW or $8,352.
 
Please investigate this potential error and advise me of your findings.
 
Thank you,

Hi,

The October ISO Actualizations are completed for Preliminary and Final Invoicing.  The Flash file can be found in the CALISO shared folder in the M: drive, with the title, "1000 A and M Settlements Summary Flash_051001.xls."

Hello All,

	I want to give you an update about where we are with January actualizations, and going forward.  Currently, charge type 523, a grid management charge, is proving very difficult to allocate given the limited information the CAISO is currently giving us.  If you want specific detail regarding this feel free to talk to myself or Caroline.  Our deadline has currently been the second week of this month to have through March completed.  Given where we are today, which is half-way through January, this deadline is probably unrealistic.  Further progress depends entirely on being able to reconfigure our tools to allocate this charge type.  It is unknown at this point how long that will take.  I plan to keep you up to date where we are so there are no surprises.  We will have a better idea in a few days when we will be finished.  Again, please talk to myself or Caroline should have any questions.

-Kit Blair

Dear Amy,

Please have a look at DMS # 7706 for an AEPC deal.
You wrote the following comment in DMS:   "Deal came through after 1st workday.  We are missing this deal.  They say the downstream is Southern Cal. Edison - there is one deal for SoCal on this day #461072.1 - but it is not routed in scheduling?"

When I looked a the deal ticket,, the deal was entered on 3-12-01, which is the day before the deal flowed.  

We are wondering why, if the deal was entered before it took place, is it just now comming thru after April 1, 2001?   Is there a chance that it was paid in March and then again in April?  

Please inform.

Thanks,

Virginia

Dear Mark and Tom,

We have received the bills for January and February transmission line losses.  I have disputed a few days each month and we have now paid the bill according to our figures for wheeled transmission: 


January 2001  Annuity Deal #  559263   for a total of    $115,579.91  (Tom's name)
February 2001 Annuity Deal #  559250  for a total of      $ 9,068.93  (Mark's name)

I have attached an excel document for each month to show our differences and how we have calculated the total annuity.  Cara and I have looked over them and we think this looks good.  (both annuities we are paying less that SRP is asking for, according to our MW Wheeling #'s)
  
Please contact me with any questions.

Thanks,

Virginia

I am on the very last piece of the actualization for October.  TJ and I went through the code for the dollar match-up for the 407 and figured out why it was creating such outrageous dollar amounts.  I have kicked off the month and will wrap it up when I get in tomorrow.

Bottom line:  October will be done early Wednesday

Next:  Start on November

I will be following behind Donna and Kit and actualizing the regular stuff and setting to M as I go.  I will also be running the Deviations through the tool, ensuring that it runs automatically and correctly.

Cross-training for Kit and Donna will follow, or will be part of the November actualization.

Deadline for November is Friday, and I am going to shoot for it.  However, I will not be able to stay past 5:00 as I have to make it to the Chiropractor that day.

I spent several hours with TJ shadowing and we tested the 402 code while I examined results.  As each error or incorrect result was noted, we went to the code and walked through and made changes.  TJ is now running actual dates and we will check them in the morning.  When all is well, we will run the rest of October.  Next we will perform the same testing and coding revisions for 405 (only need to test for EPMI-side exceptions) and then we will be able to run 405 for the month.

After the latest unsuccessful run of 403, I delved into the specific details of the variances, and all of the material volumes are included in the Finals, so any allocations that would be created as a result of those variances would be reversed when I run the Final actualization.  So, this morning I manually calculated appropriate allocations for our Load customers (the variances are due to re-submitted meter data), entered the values in the ProRata allocation table, created an additional allocation for the remaining 1.9496MW variance, matched all up to the ISO, and completed 403 for Preliminaries.

I have actualized the regular stuff and set to M through October 27.  I will wrap those up on Friday.

At this point in time we are on target for completion of Prelims by Friday afternoon, but Finals may not be done until Monday.

Anna and I worked through the coding for 403 and she made some changes to the method for finding percent usage.  I reran the tool and looked at the results and we still do not have valid allocations.  On October 1, we now have an 877MW difference between the variance and the amount allocated.  Will look into it again tomorrow.

402 is nearly complete.  Ran into an error while running a test day, and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow.  405 should be a quick fix once we get the 402 exceptions working properly.

I have actualized finals on the regular charges through October 23, and should be able to wrap up most, if not all, of the rest tomorrow.

If we can get them working properly tomorrow, then I will be able to finish the Prelims on Friday, and the Finals on Monday.

Exception handling coding changes are nearly complete.  TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

For the regular actualizations, I have set 10/1 - 10/18 (except 10/16) to M today.  There is a strange anomaly going on on the 16th, and neither Donna nor I could figure out what.  I will get back to it.

Anticipate completion of all by Monday, May 7.

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

I received a message today from one of the brokers at ED&F Mann, who said he was waiting on our payment for a Palo Verde futures contract for April. I remember something like this happening last month, and I remember you two coming to the rescue, which is why I'm asking for your assistance. If either of you get a chance on Monday, let's get together and figure out why this hasn't been paid, or maybe why it HAS been paid and not received.

I believe the deal in question is 531782 - Long Term Southwest buys from Avista for the month of April, price $196, trade date 2/26. Doesn't this seem eerily reminiscent of the last contract that ED&F Mann didn't receive payment on? Was it Avista that time too?

The contact at ED&F Mann is Martin, and his number is (212) 566-9329. Just let me know when you have a moment to talk.

Thanks,
Kate

I will be traveling this week to Houston for a meeting with Houston Settlements and I wanted to give you all the opportunity to voice any concerns, issues, or feedback that you'd like me to address while there. This meeting is to address settlements issues and cleanup.  Any feedback you can provide will be extremely handy.

I'll leave the Portland office at 3 PM tomorrow, Tuesday 4-17-01, so please e-mail me by 2 PM.

Thanks, 
Virginia

My back office has explained that we have received our  final payment for September business.  Thank you for the processing on that  part of the transaction.  We have, however, invoiced EPMI for interest  payments based on the understanding we had reached at my meeting in your offices  late last year.  The two interest invoices we have sent are for $16,359.28  and $4,530.74, for a total of $20,890.02.  To date, no payments have been  made by EPMI.  Could you look into the status of the processing on these  bills for us?
 
Thanks,
Steve

Keoni,

Is it possible to reload the Preliminary and Final Settlement Statements for trade Date 10/6/00?  What's the timeline on that?  We need it ASAP.

Thanks so much,

Hi Keoni,

Would you please clarify zones for me.

Here's what I think:

Congestion Zones are - NP15, SP15, SF HUMB, ZP26
Load Zones are - PGE1, PGE2, PGE3, PGE4, SCE1, SDG1
Tie Point - SYLMAR_2_NOB
Location ID -  ?
Resource ID - ?
Branch Group - PATH26_BG

Please provide examples of each and when they would be used (What charge
types).  I tried looking in the glossary on your web-site and wasn't
able to find everything.  Is there someplace else I could look.  I also
reviewed the settlements manual and was unable to clearly answer my
questions.

Thanks for any help you are able to provide,
Donna

Ola Mr. Stokley,
	I spoke with Les Rawson today, and he met with El Paso last week.  He said they are "really nervous," about how much money they owe us for underbilling of PX losses.  The believe it is at a minimum half a million, maybe more.  Could you forward to me any information or data regarding what we charged them, and what they still owe us?  Let me know if I can help at all, I know you are very busy.  Sweet.  Peace out.

Godfrey,

Thank you for your message this morning in regards to the payment made in December.  I would prefer if you outlined the details of the payment in an email, in order for me to clearly understand and be able to explain to my customer what the payment entails.  Also, you mentioned demand charge in your message, could you be more specific to what the various demand charges relate to?  That would be very helpful.

Thank you,

Kourtney

Dave,

Hope you're enjoying Houston.  The weather is probably alot better than it is here.  (big surprise!)

I'm a little concerned about the CP names in CAPS.  Today when I was looking at the GenSchedules for 4/30/01, there were a few CP names that were different from prior days.  "HARBOR" came across as "HARBORCOG" and "SierraPowe" came across as "SIERRAPWR."  This is only an issue b/c our lookup tables search for specific names.  I do not understand why names are changing in CAPS to their names in Enpower.  If you could look into this and let me know if there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.

Thanks Dave,
Kourtney

Godfrey,

The final actualizations for Preliminary and Final Settlements are available and can be found in the following Flash file:

M:\Electric\CALISO ACTUALIZATION\Actual\2000\Final\0900 Settlements Final ISO 042701.xls

The following customers have been paid an initial amount, and are owed the additional amount as shown:



You will note that Snohomish was overpaid, and owes us a refund in the amount of $1,591.06; the remaining amounts are balances owed to the customer.   I can find no record of an initial payment to El Paso (EPE), but the Flash report reflects a payment owed to them.  Other customers reflected in the Flash are handled in a different manner and we need to talk about those (CRC, DELANO, HARBOR, Willamette, etc.).  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions about this data, or the details in the Flash file, as well as to discuss the special-handling customers.

Please set up these payments to go out as quickly as possible, and let me know the expected payment date.

Thanks,

Caroline

Ola Mr. Stokley,
	I spoke with Les Rawson today, and he met with El Paso last week.  He said they are "really nervous," about how much money they owe us for underbilling of PX losses.  The believe it is at a minimum half a million, maybe more.  Could you forward to me any information or data regarding what we charged them, and what they still owe us?  Let me know if I can help at all, I know you are very busy.  Sweet.  Peace out.

Godfrey,

Our counterparty Wheelabrator Martel has asked me to look into the wire payment made on Dec 26, 2000 in an amount of $535,795.23.

I received an email from Audrey confirming that a wire for this amount was to be sent on the 26th.  This payment was for the Forward energy payment for the month of November as well as the November's Green Credit payment.

The forward energy payment, which I pulled from a CARP is $498,138.03
The Green Credit payment is $11,734.79
This totals   $509,872.82

Audrey added the following note:

"Wheelabrator Martel - Includes adjustment to Green Credit already paid of $25,260.59 for October.  The new adjusted amount was $12,207.  Therefore, an amount due Enron of $13,053.59 was generated."

But even with this note, I can not tie back the payment amount of $535,795.23.

If you could please assist me in researching the variance, I would greatly appreciate it.  I realize that you are still working on month-end but I would like this resolved by tomorrow if possible.  

Thank you,

Kourtney

Anna and I worked through the coding for 403 and she made some changes to the method for finding percent usage.  I reran the tool and looked at the results and we still do not have valid allocations.  On October 1, we now have an 877MW difference between the variance and the amount allocated.  Will look into it again tomorrow.

402 is nearly complete.  Ran into an error while running a test day, and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow.  405 should be a quick fix once we get the 402 exceptions working properly.

I have actualized finals on the regular charges through October 23, and should be able to wrap up most, if not all, of the rest tomorrow.

If we can get them working properly tomorrow, then I will be able to finish the Prelims on Friday, and the Finals on Monday.

Exception handling coding changes are nearly complete.  TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

For the regular actualizations, I have set 10/1 - 10/18 (except 10/16) to M today.  There is a strange anomaly going on on the 16th, and neither Donna nor I could figure out what.  I will get back to it.

Anticipate completion of all by Monday, May 7.

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

Caroline

All,

Clarification on new findings statements below:  trading minute and trade
interval are the same thing.  So,

  -- If an  exception occurs at trading minute level, the volume usage at
trade hour level is used to do pro-rata
  -- If an  exception occurs at trading hour level, the volume usage at
trade date level  is used to do pro-rata

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

Jim,
	We are missing one significant piece of info in this document. We need to add the charges associated Positive and Negative  Load Deviation (Penalty Charges). I don't think that there are any for Positive Dev., but I know that there are charges associated to Neg. Dev.

Anna made a change to SettleSupplemental today to accurately reflect the sign convention for dollar amounts for Import Deviation.  The tool was calculating payments where there should have been a charge, and vice versa.   I compared hourly values for both volume and amount between a new caclulation with the volume and expected amount result in the ISO IE table and it is reflecting them both with the correct sign convention.

Steve,

Attached are the details of the results of our actualization, estimates compared to ISO actuals, for the Import Deviation assessed against SCL schedules in September 2000.  Please note that this does not include any of the transactions for which we have submitted disputes.  I have also included details reflecting our original estimate for these charges.

Please feel free to call me or Chris Stokley if you have any questions.

Here are the comparisons that I ran for September for both energy and capacity payments between the estimate sheets that SCL is using, and the actuals received by the ISO.  I also have provided explanations for the differences between the two.   Please call me this morning (before 9 or after 10, please) if you need to discuss this further.

Melissa,

I have a question in regards to the handling of Harbor's ISO numbers with the recent payments made to them.  Were the ISO numbers included in the payment, netting against any revenues and charges in the system through Enpower?  Or were these handled in a different manner?  I just want to make sure that I have an understanding of how they were handled.

Thank you,

Kourtney

Here is a short write-up on Charge Type 521, which is one of the three new Grid Management charge types.  I am close to completing the analysis of Charge Type 523, and Donna is working on Charge Type 522.  I should be finished with my part of the analysis and have new estimations ready for actualization by the end of the week.  I will be more than happy to walk you through my discoveries so far.

Caroline

Dear Melissa,

   I was wondering if you had a chance to go over the Tools worksheet that I had sent last month (and again 2 weeks ago) that was created in response to Settlement Coordinators' request expressed in the meeting we had in March while I was in Houston?

   I spoke with Thresa Allen and she made a good suggestion that you should introduce it to the group.  
   I understand that of concern is how to introduce the worksheet as an aide and not as something that we are dictating to Settlements that must be used.  
  
   If you remember, during our meeting the Settlements Coordinators had some great questions for us pertaining to research tools and the objective of each tool.   Someone          even asked "I'm expected to do a certain amount of research, but how do I know where to find these things and how do I know what to look for?"  I think this is a pretty comprehensive attempt to answer that question and to provide documentation as to what each tool in the system provides.  

   It seems that Houston Volume Management is on board with this, so possibly we could introduce this as a tool designed by VM to help the Settlements Coordinators in the checkout and DMS processes.  

   Please let me know your thoughts on it.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

Chris,

I just wanted to take a moment to let you know what a great job Kit is doing.  He is energetic, inquisitive and consistently takes the necessary initiative to get the job done.

He asks all of the right questions, especially "why?," which inspires me to tune up my own knowledge and skills.  It is refreshing to have someone like him join the group and I anticipate that he'll be able to handle allocations completely by the end of next week.

Thank you for your foresight and for the help.

Donna

Sharon,

Please talk with Godfrey about the payment to Saguaro, as a couple of weeks ago he worked with Les Rawson to arrange a payment to them, and the ISO capacity payment was included in that amount.

You are correct on the SCL payment, and I have revised the actualized file to reflect it.

Thanks for checking.

Caroline

Caroline:

Upon review of October ISO revised activity, we have found the following discrepancies:

1.  The amount of 3,025.52 for Saguaro has been listed as an amount settled on estimate, but we show no such payment
     having transpired.
2.  We show payment of 2,050.00 for SCL on Feb. 20, 2001 by Ck No. 2000075016 but do not see the amount listed on
     your revised copy of the EPMI ISO customers for 10/00.                                                     

Please review and advise on these descrepancies.

We will make payment, with the exception of Valley Electric as per your instructions, on May 17, 2001 or May 18, 2001 depending on the journal entry booking, and will advise you of the final payment date as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Sharon

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

Caroline

I've just received approval to go ahead with the adjustment which I will be
submitting to Settlements today.  They are a bit behind so I don't expect
the change to take place any day soon, but I will keep it moving forward and
keep you appraised.  Keep in mind that there is no adjustment for December
9th as OOM calls were only made for the 7th and 8th.

Keoni,  I have been working with Donna Johnson at Enron in regards to
several days in December where the CALISO paid El Paso Merchant Energy for
some power that they should have given credit to Enron for.  The days in
question are December 7-9.  For various hours on those days, we sold the
power from our San Joaquin plant to Enron.  Enron has already paid us for
this power.  Below is a breakout of the hours that are in question.

Day 7, hours 11-24
Day 8, hours 1-6 and 23-24
Day 9, hours 1-6

This was the Uninstructed Energy, charge 407

If there is anything else you need me to do, please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Just a reminder that when entering a wheel, the Interchange ID must be the same for the import and export.  When the Import is labeled as "EPMI_CISO_**" and the Export as "CISO_EPMI_**," the ISO views these as unique imports and exports.  They will not be linked together for a wheel, thus causing ancillary services charges to occur.  

Thank you!

Hi Jennifer,

Sorry this took so long.  We experienced problems while running the October 2000 numbers.  I've attached spreadsheets which include the Load Deviation numbers for production months September, November and December 2000 for both EES and PGES.   I will forward October as soon as the calculations are complete.

Please note that the numbers have not been actualized.  The spreadsheets are draft quality and are for information purposes only.  Please let me know if you need any additional information or have any questions.  I can be reached at ext. 7733.

Thanks,
Donna Sheidun

All,

I made changes to SettleAnc and SettleSupp that will use the absolute values instead of only positive values for uninstructed energy when calculating CT 523, Market Operations Charge.

Please use the following tools so that they can be tested.  Let me know if you run into any errors or have problems, or if they meet with your approval.

The problem has been corrected and the files for 5/26 and 5/28 were

Dear Melissa,

  Per our conversation on Friday 6-8-01, I want to come to a clear understanding of the expectations of Mike and I for completing outstanding PRIORITY DMS's and true-up.

  The following have been presented as priorities (in parenthesis are comments on their status):

   PGE - purchases and sales true-up for August - November 2000  (August and September are done, October is very messy with more than 3 discrepancies on any given day; we have only 3 days left oustanding in October, and only one day outstanding in November) (No DMS's for these)

  PAC - Friday we spoke about pressing issues with PAC (that have not been entered into DMS and that we in Portland didn't know about until Friday 6-8-01).  September 2000 DMS's have been completed and we are awaiting DMS's for the October and November outstanding stuff.  (There was one day in February 2001 that was outstanding that has now been completed for Feb 2001checkouts, so we should be current now for the year 2001)

  BPA - has completed their control area checkouts for purchases, sales, and transmission for June 2000 - December 2000.  (I have trued up the transmission side for August 2000 thru December 2000 and we are currently working on trueing up purchases and sales for June 2000 thru August 2000.)  There are many discrepancies each day given that these are the summer months and there are alot of cuts.  This will take a while to finish, but we are working on it every day.

  CRC - We spoke about on Friday; nothing has been entered into DMS, thus we did not know about any discrepancies until Friday 6-8-01.  We will await the DMS entries for discrepancies with Colorado River and work on them accordingly as a priority.

  El Paso - Kate Symes in the Real Time group is almost finished with May 2001 true-up and then we should be current.  She will be the point of contact person for El Paso going forward and she will work with Kathy at El Paso daily to make sure that our numbers, Kathy's numbers, and the El Paso Model match on a daily basis.

  These are the Priority issues as I understand them.  As you can see, Mike and I are spending almost 100% of our time just on last year's true-ups.   Please understand that given this information and per your agreement, Mike and I will be putting all current issues on hold until these things are complete.  Please also let Houston Settlements Coordinators know that we are not ignoring their current DMS's on purpose.  
Please let me know if any of the above mentioned are not a priority and I will move them to a medium status with a note to the Settlements Coordinator as to why they are off of the priority list.

Thanks,

Virginia

All,

This is actually NOT a cut on a wheel, the Interchange ID's on the wheel were not identical thus the ISO did not see these as a wheel.  I corrected this in the tables.

The ISO cut the one side of my wheel on HE24 on 4/13. 

I had a firm export at 4C (EPMI_CISO_BUNNY)  of 20 mw for a sale to powerex and a wheel EPMI_CISO_ TOBY at PALO going out at Silverpeak. 
They cut the sale to POWEREX and the following imports. They cut the following:

EPMI_CISO_BUNNY 20 to a 8
EPMI_CISO_TOBY IMPORT 12 to 4. 

All this while keeping my EPMI_CISO_TOBY Export at a 12. 

Basically they used both the WHEEL IMPORT/ FIRM IMPORT to Fill the WHEEL EXPORT.

Anna,

I ran SettleGen for 4/1 and 4/2.  These appeared to return meter data in correct form.  I then ran SettleGen for 4/23-25 and these are the results I received:

4/23/01:  HE 1 = meter data
	  HE 2-24 = 0

4/24/01: HE 1= 0
	 HE 2-24 = meter data

4/25/01: HE 1 = meter data
	 HE 2-24 = 0

I understand that with the Daylight savings, there is a one hour shift, thus explaining the HE 2 on 4/23 finishing HE 1 on 4/24. I confirmed that there is meter data available for 4/23 & 4/24.  There is no meter available for 4/25 (that's another issue).  It seems that the pull is skipping a whole day.  

One other thing that I checked:
I pulled meter from the Settledb from qyrMeterDstGen_Interval for 4/24 and ran SettleGen for 4/24.  The qyr meter data HE 1-23 is equal to the SettleGen data for HE 2-24.  

If you could please call me at your earliest convenience so we can get this taken care of today if possible.

THANK YOU ANNA!!!

Kourtney

Melissa,

This looks fine.  We will let you know when payments can be released for the ones on hold per the traders.  

Amounts for Valley for September - December have been provided to Alicia for inclusion in their April billing.

For Harbor, we will be netting the amount owed to us with all of the rest of their December transactions (gas, and day ahead energy), leaving an amount owed to Harbor of $(2,843.58).  The Gas amount = $616,304.42; Day Ahead energy = ($680,400).  The ISO amount is $61,251.  The net of these three amounts is the amount due.  Please confirm that you are seeing these values in the system.

Amy,

I did some research on the first adjustment that Redding shows (2/7/00, 20MWh, price change HE 18 per the backup e-mail from the ISO) and found the following deal:  291440

The deal is for 20MW in various hours (including HE 18), and is at NP15.  The price in EnPower reflects $37.14, which does not match either of the prices that Redding is showing.

This is a deal that would have been settled at the ISO Ex Post Market price and included in the checkout by the Houston Settlements group, and is not a transaction that we would have knowledge of.  My suspicion is that all of the rest are the same kind of deal.  You can research them using Deal Entry in the Find screen.  Fortunately, there aren't a lot of adjustments. You will also need to know what we originally settled on with them for these dates in order to confirm the additional invoice amount.

Hope this helps,

Caroline

I analyzed the results of last nights Settle15 run for Load Deviation and discovered that the change made did not solve the rate problem.  I then analyzed all of the formulas that calculate the volume and the associated rate to use, retrieved some sample Load Schedules and Meter data to use in testing, and have made the right corrections to a copy of Settle15_TenMinute.xls (Settle15_TenMinute_403update042401_cme.xls).  I ran a test day and verified that the Load Deviation piece is now using the correct volume and applying the appropriate rate.

I have also verified that we have the right formulas in place for Import Deviation for both volume and rate.  These correct formulas are in the copied workbook.

Since these were incorrect, I researched the results that we obtain using SettleSupplemental and discovered that the formula that determines which rate is applied had the cell references backwards (where the result should have been the Inc it returned the Dec instead, and vice versa).  I reversed them in a copy of SettleSupp (SettleSupplemental_IncDec_reversal_042101_cme.xls), ran a test day and confirmed that the resulting volumes and rates are correct.

I also took a quick look into the formulas for SettleAncillary, and found no inconsistencies.  Fortunately, since that is the tool that created all of the SCL charges.

I have all of these documented if you want to go over them.  The upshot is that in order to restate our actualization for 403 and 405 (hence, total 407), I need to re-run Settle15 for the month of September for charge types 403 and 405 only, as well as SettleSupplemental (I will be using the copied workbooks until everyone has tested them and they are changed to the originals).  I am going to kick off the Settle15 part now (on Terminal Server 1), then come in early tomorrow and kick off the Supplemental piece.  

I anticipate completion of this restate for 403 and 405 by close of business Wednesday.

Caroline

Charge types 402, 403 and 404 have been fully re-allocated and are set to A.  

Finals for the regular stuff have been completed; incomplete actualization found for 9/5 and will need to be re-run on Monday.  Data had not been set to M as the allocations were not correct.  Did not discuss the date with Brett.

Charge type 405 (Import Deviation) is being re-run, with exceptions created that will require manual allocations.  The volume is still not allocating properly and research must be done to determine what is causing the bad allocations.  I may need some help looking at the data, if help can be found.

What is outstanding for Prelim actualization:
Finish 405 allocations, upload to Oracle, and set them to A.
Run Total 407 to assign remaining dollar variances to ECTstCA.
Run entire process, comparing A's to F's for Finals
Upload Finals to Oracle and set to M
Re-run 9/5 Final
Run Flash reports for A and M to double-check a match to the Invoices.

Still shooting for a COB Tuesday for all.

We have transferred new allocations for Gen and Export Dev based on the changes to the formula that I gave to TJ.  Tomorrow we will work on redoing Load Dev using the same formula changes, then we need to finish researching whatever is wrong with Import Deviation and get that one done.  

Once all four are done and transferred, then we can do the Total 407 part, which will identify remaining dollar variances and allocate that amount to ECTstCA.  The code hasn't been fully tested yet, so completion of this part may be delayed until cob Monday.

I am finished with September Finals for the non-deviation stuff through the 28th, and will have the last two days done tomorrow morning.

I anticipate having all of September completely actualized (for both Preliminary and Final) by cob Tuesday.

TJ looking into the formulas, with Anna's assistance as best she can by telephone and IM.  We had to dump the existing export deviation records and re-do the manuals that had been previously added incorrectly, so that type will have to be run through the process again for sure.

No additional progress on any of the other things that need to be done for September, with the exception of 3 days worth of Finals actualized without deviations.

Tomorrow is another day, and if Anna is back we'll get that much closer to completion of Prelims by weeks' end.  At least we didn't have a database crash today.

Continue to have difficulties matching up volumes for Import Deviation, caused by an internal database functionality problem.  

Have analyzed the Instructed/Uninstructed settlement data provided by the ISO and created formulas for variance identification and allocation for all types of deviation, as well as special case handling (exceptions or export deviation for example).  Also looking into Region differences and working with Anna on how to incorporate region into the process.

Anna has added the functionality to be able to actualize by settlement file SeqID, but this needs to be tested (settlement database crash prohibited proper testing today).

Reviewed TJ's functionality for allocating dollar variances in Total 407 (after volumetric and related dollar variances are allocated, remaining dollar variances are applied to ECTstCA); provided feedback on same.

Need to accomplish the following  to wrap-up September:

Review formulas currently in database - revise if needed
Test formulas
Obtain valid allocations for variances (especially for 405)
Check results on new allocations for 402, 403 and 404 to see if formula changes made any difference, and if so, is difference good
Delete existing allocations (based on current formulas, may be invalid)
Send new allocations up to FSP
Run total 407
Re-run whole process for Finals
Finish Final actualizations (Brett left off at the 19th)

Anticipate completion of deviation stuff for Prelims complete by end of week, and finals by Tuesday next.

Keoni,

As our group has researched all of these new Out of Market charges, we
have yet to see charges tied back to strictly to exports.  The Soft Cap
Pmt/Allocation charges (481/487) are based on underscheduled load and
overscheduled generation.  CT 485 relates only to generators.

The Underscheduled Load Penalty/Revenue charges (480/1480) apply to
total load plus exports if there is a variance by more than 95%.  For
our non-load customers, this would most likely only occur if the export
schedule is cut.  The alternate way this might happen is if EPMI
decreases load and exports the power.

Are there any other OOM penalties that we are missing?  Specifically any
relating to exports.

I know how fun these things are to sort through, thank you for your
help.

Sean,

The estimated charge for December 2000 DC Line Loss for ECTstNW is approximately $200,000.00. This number was based on the following:

*The total Line Loss at SYLMAR_2_NOB was approximately 1,394 Mw
*ECTstNW's allocation was approximately 920 Mw (66% of the total line loss).  The 66% was derived using ECTstNW's total scheduled exports divided by EPMI's total scheduled exports.
*The rate used was $217.68 which was the average of the incremental price for December 2000.

I've attached a couple of spreadsheets which may be helpful.

You may look forward to the final numbers for December 2000 by May 21. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Donna

All,

An error was discovered in SettleGeneration for Charge type 402.  Prior to the change, the rate being pulled was always the Dec, the logic in the formula was incorrect.  Now, when the deviation mw are greater than zero, they are paid the dec and when the deviation mw are less than zero, the are buying the Inc.  This was tested with Caroline and Donna's approval.  The new tool is effective as of now and is properly names in the ISOandPX folder.

Thanks,
Kourtney

I used the Volume from either 521 or 351 to calculate the average price for various charge types.  Look at O:/portland/westdesk/volumemanagement/volmgnt/Jim/EES Monthly/Average Rate Analysis EES.xls

Murray and Chris, 

The following is more detail on what had occurred below.
In running the metervalidation tool, I noticed on 5/28-a Monday there was a lower than average meter for load zone SDG1 (San Diego).  It was reported at 2,461, when a typical weekday is around 2,750.  I phoned Pat, and we discussed what was occurring and we noticed that Sat. was reported at 2,757 5/26, Sat.  Typically weekends days run at 2450 in SDG1.  

Pat's explanation doesn't fully explain why the weekend would slide one day.  And just in time, we discovered it.

If you need more information, please let me know.  I just re-ran the meter validation and the correct values are placed in 5/26 and 5/28.

I discovered this error, and had Pat send us an e-mail explaining the reason the Meter was wrong as well as updating the data.  They updated this within the 45 days.

Jim, the above settlement files were misstated due to an error in tracking
weekend vs weekdays. The original file showed the data for 5/26 to be a
normal load for a weekday while 5/28 reflected the load for a weekend.
The problem has been corrected and the files for 5/26 and 5/28 were
reposted.  The file for 5/26 was reposted on 7/17, day 45.

Dear Laura,

Just wanted to let you know that the $0 price on Nevada Power deal # 549117.1 is correct.  David Porter gave the following reason:

Monika thought she had purchased APS transmission to wheel from LV Cogen to NEVP, but she hadn't.  I guess this is kind of a bookout at $0 cost to customer.

The NEVP doesn't need to know the reason, just that the price is at $0.

Thanks,

Virginia

Jennifer, we received full payment for September and October; however, for November and December 2000, the ISO charged one hundred cents on the dollar and paid partial cents on the dollar.  Please see the emails below for details on those distributions.

Hopefully this helps, if you need anything else, please call me.

Subject:	CAISO Notice - Disbursement of Funds for December Invoice


		SC Settlements Contacts:
		Cash clearing for preliminary invoices for December 2001 was
to take place on March 5, 2001.  The ISO received market related funds
totaling $46,369,847.29 from total market receivables of $1,503,186,210.21.
The ISO intends to distribute these funds on March 7, 2001.  The ISO delayed
this distribution to allow us to complete the complex calculations necessary
to ensure that all funds are distributed equitably and in accordance with
the ISO Tariff.
		In addition, PG&E transferred $177,000,000 ($171,116,114.43
net of GMC obligation) to the ISO on March 2, 2001.  Such funds were
intended by PG&E to satisfy PG&E obligations to the ISO through the
California Power Exchange.   The California Power Exchange is the subject of
a preliminary injunction (Case No. 01-00901CM of the US District Court,
Central District of California,  "Enron Power Marketing and Enron Corp. vs.
California Power Exchange") which provides that "CalPX shall not be required
to make payments to creditors of CalPX resulting from its clearinghouse
function."    The ISO is discussing with its counsel the appropriate course
of action to take in light of this injunction, and has placed such funds in
a segregated interest bearing account until such a determination has been
made.

Dear Thresa,

  I'm writing to follow up on our phone conversation of last week regarding the document I put together to help Houston Settlements in the researching disputes.  
I know that you and Melissa have been busy, so I was wondering if you had yet had a chance to talk with her and the Houston VM group about it, as I hoped to get it into production this week.  Please let me know your thoughts or suggestions.

 Thanks,

Chris,
    Could you please look at this?  We are trying to determine if we should pay this or not.  It appears we withheld payment from CDWR because of the PX short payment.  Do we need to call CDWR and tell them we are not going to pay until we collect from the PX?  Amy Clemons keeps talking about an annuity that needs to put in Enpower.  Stuart seems to have no idea what to do.  In any case, I am not sure what to do with this, can you shed some light on it.  Word.

Stewart, I would like to come to an agreement on November and December payments.  The situation to date re the sharing agreement:
 
CDWR November Profit    $1,025,958.32
EPMI Paid CDWR                606,753.73
 
December Short Pay         $ 419,204.59    from EPMI's records
 
Edgar Najera of CDWR invoiced EPMI for $189,148.33 for the month of December 2000.  In addition, EPMI owes CDWR $20,500 for 82 MWs x $250/mw for HE 2200 on December 6, 2000.  CDWR delivered 275 MWs to EPMI in NP15; EPMI delivered 193 MWs to CDWR in SP15.  Total owed CDWR = $209,648.33.
 
What is the status of the December payment at this point?  The last phone conversation I had with you you indicated the $209,648.33 did not include any short pay for December.
 
Will you please get back to me and let me know what is needed to complete the November/December transactions?

I have passed this information on to the group (Mike Marryott) that will be making the appropriate changes to the Meter Scout.

I don't own that application in the FSP/VMS world (at least for now).

The Meter Scout will have to be re-written to handle the new procedures.

Overview
The California ISO is enhancing two of its meter data systems, scheduled to
be in production by October 2001.  The objective of this development effort
is to provide the ISO with robust, flexible, maintainable, and more
cost-effective metering systems to meet its ever-changing market and
internal needs.  Market participants and other systems will use the internet
based MDAS-Online application for meter data submission and requests.

Timeline for project
Market Simulation	August 20 through August 31
Production Implementation	October 1

Impacts of project
	*	New interface for MDAS-Online
			o	Same look and feel as new OASIS interface
	*	Multiple valid file formats
			o	MDEF and CSV file formats for meter data
submission and requests
	*	No longer use FTP to submit MDEF files
			o	Interim FTP service for file submission
during transition
			o	File submission only, no FTP
acknowledgements or requests
	*	Automation specification will be provided
			o	Submission of meter data file
			o	Download of meter data file submission
status
			o	Download of meter data
	*	Additional equipment and software
			o	Smart Card security
			o	Netscape Navigator browser
	*	ECN connection no longer required for meter data submission
and requests
			o	The file submission and reporting will take
place over a secure internet connection
	*	No formal training required
			o	Online help in application
			o	MDAS Operators
			o	System Support


Questions will be addressed at the next TSWG Conference call (6/26/01 @1330
PST) or send inquiries to Leslie Feusi at Lfeusi@caiso.com.

FYI-

  As of June 2001, Portland General Electric's Enpower name has been changed from PORTLAND to PORTLANDGE.  
  You can pull CARPs for both counterparties, but if you enter deals, only PORTLANDGE is active.
  This will make a difference for anyone true-ing up months prior to June 1, 2001 by entering the deals into the system after June 1, 2001, as the information will fall under 2 counterparties and will have to be merged in Excel.  

  Please ask me if you have any questions.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

All, 

HA Wheeling Cong was calcing incorrectly.  Donna and I made a change to how the charge was being calculated as follows:

OLD:

(HA Export Wheeling MW * HA Import Price) + (HA Import Wheeling MW * HA Export Price)

NEW:

(HA Import Wheeling MW * HA Import Price) - (HA Export Wheeling MW * HA Export Price)

Thus effective at COB today, the new Settle15 will be in production.

Let Donna or I know if you have any questions,

Kourtney

Donna, 

Can you give me the a  percentage that is related to EES?  The traders at EES is concerned how much cash we are actually receiving from the ISO related to ancillary sales EPMI has made on EES behalf?

Thanks,

Jennifer

Jennifer, we received full payment for September and October; however, for November and December 2000, the ISO charged one hundred cents on the dollar and paid partial cents on the dollar.  Please see the emails below for details on those distributions.

Hopefully this helps, if you need anything else, please call me.

Subject:	CAISO Notice - Disbursement of Funds for December Invoice


		SC Settlements Contacts:
		Cash clearing for preliminary invoices for December 2001 was
to take place on March 5, 2001.  The ISO received market related funds
totaling $46,369,847.29 from total market receivables of $1,503,186,210.21.
The ISO intends to distribute these funds on March 7, 2001.  The ISO delayed
this distribution to allow us to complete the complex calculations necessary
to ensure that all funds are distributed equitably and in accordance with
the ISO Tariff.
		In addition, PG&E transferred $177,000,000 ($171,116,114.43
net of GMC obligation) to the ISO on March 2, 2001.  Such funds were
intended by PG&E to satisfy PG&E obligations to the ISO through the
California Power Exchange.   The California Power Exchange is the subject of
a preliminary injunction (Case No. 01-00901CM of the US District Court,
Central District of California,  "Enron Power Marketing and Enron Corp. vs.
California Power Exchange") which provides that "CalPX shall not be required
to make payments to creditors of CalPX resulting from its clearinghouse
function."    The ISO is discussing with its counsel the appropriate course
of action to take in light of this injunction, and has placed such funds in
a segregated interest bearing account until such a determination has been
made.

Dear Bill, Kate, and Les,

   I wanted to let you all know what we are doing concerning deals # 524528.1 (purchase from Willamet)  and 524529.1 (sale to PACE).  
I believe that we are all now familiar with the details of these deals.   Mike, Geir, Les, and I have spent a combined 4 hours or more researching this deal over the last month.  Our last resort is to pull the tapes.  As we do not have access to our tapes and I am not sure when we will have them back, we have decided to do the following until we have the tapes back and can verify that the sale to PAC did take place:  

* I have extended the sale of 4 MW's of Willamet generation to PAC to include HE 13.  
* I have TEMPORARILY zero'd out the HE 14-24 piece of this deal on the PAC side with notes

As the payment is 3 months overdue, we will pay now and get reimbursed if we find that we are correct.

Please share any thoughts with me that you may have.

Thanks to everyone for your help in researching this.

Virginia

Chris and Murray,

To reiterate the story, Phil Tuohy needs access to Wheelabrator Shasta and Martel unit information.  He is able to access Shasta's information but not Martel's information.  When he goes to the Enronwest website, he sees the two counterparty names "WheelSHAST" and "Wheelabrator Settlements" (the second is Martel's info) but the "Wheelabrator Settlements" gives him an error.  I first approached Allen about this in the beginning of December and sent an email with the details on December 7th.  This email is below.  I then followed up with another email Jan 24th describing two different issues with the enronwest site.  Allen called with an answer to one of the problems, but did not address the second issue--which was Phil's issue.  This email is also below.  I do not believe that Allen was able to replicate Phil's error, but I do not know how much further he looked into the issue.

Phil Tuohy called this morning and is frustrated that he can only receive the Martel information via emails that I send.  He sees the Wheelabrator/Enron relationship continuing indefinitely and needs timely access to the data.  I told him that I would elevate this issue to my manager in order to get an answer for him.  Let me know what else you need from me.

Thanks,
Kourtney

**DECEMBER 7th email**

Allen,

Talked to Phil at Wheelabrator.  His browser is AOL version 4.0.  But he made a good point--
if he can see WheelSHAST with this browser, shouldn't he be able to see Wheelabrat Settlements?

When he clicks on Wheelabrat Settlements, this is the URL address that pops up:

eel.enronwest.com/goPage.asp?url=/settlements/settlementlist.asp?/Wheelabrat

But when I log on as him and click on Wheelabrat settlements, I get this URL address:

http://eel.enronwest.com/settlements/settlementlist.asp?/Wheelabrat

The URL he sees matches the one that we use in Lotus Notes workspace for setting up the accounts.  

So obviously it is sending him to the wrong address.  

His name is Phil Tuohy at (863) 665-2255 x112 if you would like to ask him any questions directly.

Thank you for you help on this,

Kourtney


**JANUARY 24TH email**

Allen,

I have spoken with each of our customers that are having problems and asked them the questions that you requested.  Here are the results:

USER NAME AND PASSWORD:  to view both:  ptuohy, phil;   only "Wheelabrator Settlements":  martel, tuohywm
INTERNET BROWSER,VERSION: AOL 4.0 for Windows  (he said that he thought his browser was IE but AOL came up when he went to the Help:About menu)
COOKIES?: could not find where to check for this

Also, Heather logged on as Phil Tuohy (WheelSHAST) on an outside analog line and could see both the "WheelSHAST" and "Wheelabrator Settlements."  She also logged in as Fabi Mendez (Arco) and she could see the customer information.

If you could please see where the problems may lay, I would greatly appreciate it.  I have dealt with some very frustrated customers and would really like to be able to serve them better.  If there is anything else you need from me or the customers, please let me know.  This is an issue I would like resolved as soon as possible.  Thank you Allen and enjoy the long weekend.

Hi,

The final ISO Invoice for February is available.  We are owed a total of $700,107.52 for Market Operations, and there is no payment due for Grid Management.  We should receive this payment sometime on May 17, 2001.

Please call me if you are unable to access the database for retrieval, and I will be more than happy to fax you a copy of the Invoice.

This is the latest:

*10/1/00-10/11/00 have been set to "A."
*10/12/00-10/20/00 have been allocated and transferred to oracle.
(Need to do some manual work with Grid and Wheeling before setting to "A", should take 1/2 day tomorrow)
*Created the allocation records for 10/21/00-10/31/00
(Need to transfer to oracle and Set to A)

I put in 7.5 hours today and tried really hard to wrap October up tonight.  I ran into some manual adjustments that took longer to research than I anticipated.  
We're still on tract for getting October out this week.  I'll stay as long as I physically can tomorrow to complete it.  The only reason I'm leaving now is because I'm getting really tired and I want to cherish the Lakers win (smile).

I will give you another update at the Staff meeting tomorrow.

The tool was calculating payments where there should have been a charge, and vice versa.   I compared hourly values for both volume and amount between a new caclulation with the volume and expected amount result in the ISO IE table and it is reflecting them both with the correct sign convention.

Dear Melissa, Rebecca, and Michael,

  I'm sending you an attachment of a manual that I have in progress that I think may be a useful tool for Settlements in order to help the Settlement Coordinators in their research before they enter a dispute into DMS.

  I believe that by following this outline, the coordinators can easily find information that will help to settle a dispute and I hope that we can eliminate 10% of the total number of disputes entered each month.  

  Please look over what I have put together and provide me with any feedback or additions that you might have.  
  
  I hope to have this document ready for implementation by next Friday 5-18-01.

  Thanks for your help, guys.

  Virginia

Chris,

I understand that Virginia has been approached to head down to Houston and meet with the Settlements group.  I would like to be part of that as well, if that is alright.  There are still some things they do on their side that I would like to learn about, and I think that Virginia and I could collaborate on a sharing of information meeting and both would get a lot out of it.

Let me know.  I guess the date hasn't been settled, yet, but I am available pretty much any time in the next few weeks.

Pete,

Last week I resubmitted meter data to the ISO for 3/25/01.  The files CSC placed out there are still there after 
I re-submitted.  Are you the one to delete the files after re-submittal?

I spoke with Pat, and that was her understanding.  Any files over 45 days are held in suspense until we 
delete them, even if they have been sent to the ISO.

Correct my understanding if this is not the case...  If it is the case, you can delete the 3/25 files for ees and pges.

Jim

Dear Tim,

Thank you for your feedback.

The weekly meetings are going well.  We're actually meeting every other week and I am providing DPR impact reports and feedback to the traders on a weekly basis.  I find that meeting every other Wednesday gives me a chance to monitor trends per each desk and gives me time to collect information about settlements issues, such as new fees and or ancillary charges that affect the short-term desks.  (For example, please see summary of newly-imposed Nevada Power transmission fees and e-mail from Amy Clemons regarding the APS/Pinnacle West EOL purchases that were provided in yesterday's reports.)

I am getting excellent feedback and response time from the traders.  Cara has been extremely helpful in providing feedback on issues that pertain tot he ST NW and ST SW desks, and Jesse has been a very valuable resource in the real-time desk.  

Below is a summary of what we spoke about in yesterday's meeting:

Real-Time: Getting better; no apparent trends.  There were 25 new disputes this past week that were real-time related.
I have had to pull 8 tapes in the past month.  Of the 8, we were correct twice (25% of the time) and the counterparty was correct 6 times (75% of the time).  If better notes had been kept, we could have avoided the tape-pulling process.  
Real Time will be affected by the new NPC transmission ancillary charges when NPC tranny is purchased real-time.
DPR impact: Overall positive DPR impact for the month of March ($1,101,755.20) has decreased by  $18,350.00 due to disputes that were settled not in our favor.  (Common negative impacts are a result of: a lower sell-to price than what was originally recorded in EnPower, a higher buy-from price than was originally recorded in EnPower, the addition of transmission to a deal that had been left out of EnPower, and over-purchasing of transmission or power.)  

Services:  I'm still seeing too many deals that are not being recorded in EnPower, though they may be in the trader's log.   Many of these deals go unrecorded in the Dispute Management System (DMS), as Caroline and Virginia do weekly checkouts with these counterparties to catch problems before the month-end. 
DPR Impact: The most common problem comes from Real-time not recording each deal in EnPower.  The DPR impact is typically positive when this happens because when both sides of the deal are entered, EPMI nets between $1 - $5 per megawatt hour.

ST NW: No trends.  We have some transmission cleanup from November that has come back.
The NW will not be affected by the new NPC transmission charges.
DPR Impact: This week's disputes, yet still unsettled, create a negative $ 9,605.75 impact.  These disputes have been re-opened for the month of November 2000.  This year's to-date DPR impact has been minimal (approx. $900) and has been mainly due to month-end annuities for ancillary charges.

ST SW:  Only trend: counterparty name changes from APS to Pinnacle West.  No DPR impact on name changes.
The southwest desk will be affected by the new NPC transmission ancillary charges, as this desk reserves Nevada Power transmission.  The southwest desk will also be subject to the APS/Pinnacle West name change for all EOL deals as of 3/10/01.
DPR impact:  This year to date, there is a positive $82,361.57 impact that is due mainly to a credit annuity for overpaid transmission.  Any negative impacts are due to month-end annuities for ancillary charges and are under $5000.00.

ST CA:  All bilateral disputes have come from EES.  
DPR impact: The large positive DPR impact over the last month is the result of two EES deals that had not been added to the system.



In addition, I am working with the DMS computer team in Houston designing reports that will give the following information:

date dispute was entered into system vs. date dispute was closed
date dispute was presented to trader vs. when the trader responded
patterns on each desk or trends that can be addressed
trader's name who is responsible for the hour that is in question during a dispute
when the dispute is resolved, how much actual time was put into it
percentage of how often we are correct vs. how often the counterparty is correct 
who is responsible for the labor that went into the dispute (counterparty, EPMI trader)
DPR impact per desk
trend in number of disputes per month vs. prior year

 I will provide you a preliminary design of what I would like these reports to look like in the first go-around.


Any feedback you can provide will be extremely helpful to me.
 

Thanks again,

Virginia

This is what I found:

1) Waheed A. Ahmad of CSC, has records of entering PGES 4/29/01 into Sparky.  Apparently, this did not occur.

2) Pete Davis ran meter scout, and we have confirmations everyday except the 29th.

3) On June 14, Reyes ran both Meter Validation and Schd Vs Meter for several days including the 29th; the lack of data for PGES wasn't picked up.  29th was checked off

4) During April actualization, Anc Charges, and deviation variances for the 29th were not flagged and addressed.

5) Today, 7/17, Chris Stokley calls me and asks why there is no meter in the system.

That is what happened on 4/29.

Dear Murray (and Chris),

    Mike and I have been noticing that a newcommer in Houston, Alicia Nguyen, may be in need of some additional attention from the Settlements group.  We understand that she had limited training time with Laura Dewett before Laura left the Settlements group, and we recognize that she is not at fault in her mistakes.  This does, however, seem like an issue that needs to be addressed immediately.  
    It does not seem that Alicia knows how to identify real variances or how to then enter the disputes into DMS properly so that we understand what we need to research (and skewing the numbers that I report to our traders) .  Often times, we have found that a problem that she has identified as a dispute is not in duspute, which can be frustrating to us as well and delaying the DMS process.  We think that with some guidance, she will have a much better understanding of the process and be better able to identify real discrepancies. 
   For examples and recommendations, please see Mike or myself.

   We appreciate you attention to this matter,

  Virginia

Virginia,

It seems that Alicia Nguyen in Houston Settlements is not understanding the nature of disputes and the DMS system.  On many occasions we are getting disputes that are not justified when comparing to Enpower.  Alicia may need more training in determining a disputes and how to lay them out on the DMS form.  

Thank you

Murray-

  FYI - I have asked Bill Williams to take a moment to sit down with me to talk.  
The purpose of our conversation will be to come to an agreement on the process for intra-month and end-of-month checkouts with EL Paso.
It has been my understanding that the Real time traders are responsible for making sure that the El Paso Model matches EnPower before the end of each shift.  
This past month, Thresa Allen called me regarding the recurring problems that we are having with El Paso and wanted to know why Amy is seeing so many discrepancies at the end of each month.  I have since then filled in the reconciliation model which hi-lights the variances that we have between the model and Enpower and have researched many of those discrepancies intra-month.  Of the ones I could not figure out, asked Bill for help so that they would be finished by month-end.  He gave them to Kate (who is not familiar with the El Paso Model), so Kate and I spent 2 hours going over the issues. 
Today, Amy Clemons called me, having repeated the reconciliation and wanted to know if she should be entering all of the disputes that are still outstanding into DMS since I am working on them and wanted to know if she needed to repeat the checkout process if I am already on it.  She also asked if she should correspond with Kate or Bill in Real Time.  

As I wish not to take on another counterparty for checkouts, I would like to come to an agreement and hold everyone to it.  (I spent at least 3 hours on El Paso's May numbers already and we aren't even finished).

Let me know if you'd like to know the outcome of our discussions.

Virginia

Dear Bill,

  If I remember correctly, you will be having a real-time trader meeting tomorrow.  
We were wondering if you thought it might be beneficial for Mike, Donna, and I to formally introduce ourselves (especially to the 4 new guys) at the end of your meeting and to address a few items of importance and how they affect EPMI getting paid (California, El Paso, MPC, tranny charges, and traders' logs).  Please let us know if you think our input might be useful.

Thanks,

Jes,

Can you please let me know what steps have been taken to improve the disputes we are having with EES?  After speaking with our settlements coordinator in Houston, we both think that 80% of the problems are on our Portland side.  Is there a better process that we can impose that will help us to make less technical errors (especially when sending EES our spreadsheets)?  

Just wondering so I know what to expect.

Thank you,

VA

Pat,

I have been reviewing the Meter Vs. Load Validation Report we use to keep an eye on Load Schedule vs. Meter Data.

I have been running these reports daily since 4/1/01.  We have found the following information missing from the reports from 4/1-4/9.

All the missing information is for PGES

1) Zone MID1 and SMD1 is missing both Load Sch. and Meter
2) Zone PGE1, PGE2, PGE4 are missing Meter Data

Due to all the issues we have been experiencing lately, we want to make sure that all the data is complete.  Could you let me know via
e-mail, what you know about these zones, and why we are missing this data.

Thank you.

Jim

I spent several hours with TJ shadowing and we tested the 402 code while I examined results.  As each error or incorrect result was noted, we went to the code and walked through and made changes.  TJ is now running actual dates and we will check them in the morning.  When all is well, we will run the rest of October.  Next we will perform the same testing and coding revisions for 405 (only need to test for EPMI-side exceptions) and then we will be able to run 405 for the month.

After the latest unsuccessful run of 403, I delved into the specific details of the variances, and all of the material volumes are included in the Finals, so any allocations that would be created as a result of those variances would be reversed when I run the Final actualization.  So, this morning I manually calculated appropriate allocations for our Load customers (the variances are due to re-submitted meter data), entered the values in the ProRata allocation table, created an additional allocation for the remaining 1.9496MW variance, matched all up to the ISO, and completed 403 for Preliminaries.

I have actualized the regular stuff and set to M through October 27.  I will wrap those up on Friday.

At this point in time we are on target for completion of Prelims by Friday afternoon, but Finals may not be done until Monday.

Anna and I worked through the coding for 403 and she made some changes to the method for finding percent usage.  I reran the tool and looked at the results and we still do not have valid allocations.  On October 1, we now have an 877MW difference between the variance and the amount allocated.  Will look into it again tomorrow.

402 is nearly complete.  Ran into an error while running a test day, and I will discuss it with TJ tomorrow.  405 should be a quick fix once we get the 402 exceptions working properly.

I have actualized finals on the regular charges through October 23, and should be able to wrap up most, if not all, of the rest tomorrow.

If we can get them working properly tomorrow, then I will be able to finish the Prelims on Friday, and the Finals on Monday.

Exception handling coding changes are nearly complete.  TJ had to weave through the code for 402 all the way, as well as add 3 new function points: EPMI exceptions, ISO exceptions, and repeating (scavenging, he calls it) the exception roll up function from another module.  He has a test environment set up and is testing EPMI variance allocations, EPMI exceptions and ISO exceptions.  He has not yet done the 'scavenging' part.  He will be finished with 402 tonight, and tomorrow I will test the results on one of the days where I had samples of these exceptions.

The part of 405 that needs to be changed is for EPMI exception handling, which should be a much less involved endeavor.  

For 403, I attempted to follow all of the queries through to see if I could run some tests within the environment and determine what was being pulled as a variance, and how that variance was being allocated.  However, these queries are currently beyond my expertise (I plan to rectify that).  We are going to enlist Anna's help as much as possible for 403, and get to the bottom of what is happening.  As a side note, for the time change date, we have an extra HE 2, and the ISO has HE 25.  We are also going to get with Anna on how to resolve that.

For the regular actualizations, I have set 10/1 - 10/18 (except 10/16) to M today.  There is a strange anomaly going on on the 16th, and neither Donna nor I could figure out what.  I will get back to it.

Anticipate completion of all by Monday, May 7.

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

Chris,

The issue here is whether the CalPX or California Energy Resources Schedule=
r ("CERS") owes us $186,000 for the power we delivered to the CalPX from Fe=
bruary 1st through 6 under our block forward contracts.=09=09=09=09=09=09

The State of California, i.e., CERS, is responsible for payment of this pow=
er.  It is true that we scheduled the block forwards through the Cal PX on =
Feb. 1-6, and that we did not schedule this power through CERS until Februa=
ry 6 (delivery on the 7th).  But Governor Davis issued Emergency Orders D-2=
0-01 and D-21-01 on January 31st.  Under these Orders, the So. Cal. Edison =
and PG&E block forward contracts were "hereby commandeered by the State of =
California to be held subject to the control and coordination of the State =
of California."  The Orders were effective "immediately."  Because the Orde=
rs was effective on January 31st, the State had title to the contracts from=
 January 31st forward.  Section 8572 of the California Emergency Services A=
ct authorizes the Governor to commandeer private property, but requires the=
 State to pay the "reasonable value thereof."  Therefore, since the State o=
f California had legal title to the contracts and the power supplied under =
those contracts on February 1st, the State of California---through CERS---i=
s responsible for paying for power delivered on February 1st, and forward. =
=20

Responsibility for payment falls on the party with title to the power, not =
the party responsible for scheduling the power.  Just because the CalPX con=
tinued to schedule power for a few days while CERS got its act together doe=
s not mean that the PX was responsible for payment.  Once California took t=
itle to the power,---and all the benefits of having the power---it also ass=
umed responsibility for payment.=20

I would be happy to explain this to CERS, if you want.  Let me know.

Hi Chris,=09
=09
=09I wanted to check on California Energy Resouces Scheduling - the piece t=
hey disputed paying us in February.  Virginia had in DMS that you are handl=
ing this now. So, to refresh your memory, they did not pay us $186,000 in F=
ebruary - broken down as follows:

Deal #533136.1  2/1/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/2/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/3/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/5/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200
Deal #533136.1  2/6/01  800 mws on peak @ $46.50/mw =3D $37,200

They said CDWR did not pick a block forward from the PX until 2/7/01.  So t=
hey are saying these weren't theirs until the 7th.

Thus my accounts receiveable shows that we have been shorted $186,000.  I n=

so that they will not be charged for the above days they are disputing.  I =
really need to get this fixed as soon as possible - since this shows possib=
le exposure to us if we can't collect or DPR to the West if we have to remo=

Let me know if you have any questions and let me know what info. you have.

Thanks!

Pete/Dave,

There still seems to be an issue with the PMI data pulling in every morning.  The Forecast and DayAhead data has not been coming in on a consistent basis.  Basically every morning,  I have had to run the ISO crawler/CAPS Import tool in order to pull in the data.  This seems to do the trick so I am curious as to why the job that runs every morning is not picking up the data.  This has been taking 20-30 minutes for me to pull in the data in the morning and it would be great if I could decrease this time.  Please let me know if there is something that can be done to help speed up my process.

Thanks,
Kourtney

Godfrey,

I have revised the Snohomish number, as we had a counter party called SNO that actually belongs to Snohomish.  I am inserting a new table with the corrected amount (they still owe us money, it's just more money).

Godfrey,

The final actualizations for Preliminary and Final Settlements are available and can be found in the following Flash file:

M:\Electric\CALISO ACTUALIZATION\Actual\2000\Final\0900 Settlements Final ISO 042701.xls

The following customers have been paid an initial amount, and are owed the additional amount as shown:



You will note that Snohomish was overpaid, and owes us a refund in the amount of $1,591.06; the remaining amounts are balances owed to the customer.   I can find no record of an initial payment to El Paso (EPE), but the Flash report reflects a payment owed to them.  Other customers reflected in the Flash are handled in a different manner and we need to talk about those (CRC, DELANO, HARBOR, Willamette, etc.).  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions about this data, or the details in the Flash file, as well as to discuss the special-handling customers.

Please set up these payments to go out as quickly as possible, and let me know the expected payment date.

Thanks,

Caroline

When logging a problem, if we do not assign the incident to anyone--who receives the email and how do we know who is going to resolve it?  Is there a 'default' person whom we should assign issues when we don't know who should handle the problem?

Also, is there a closing procedure for the incidents?  If we add an incident and work w/ the IT person to resolve it, do we need to close the incident?  What is our responsibility?  

Thanks Mike, we just want to make sure that we are using your tool in the most efficient manner.

Kourtney

Dear Joy and Michael,

Please have a look at DMS 7325 which is associated with deal # 347382.1.  

This DMS is a dispute with South Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc.   Our trader Mark Fischer's name is on this deal, but he does not trade ERCOT / Texas.  

When I type in the deal # that is on the DMS, the counterparty pulls up as Valey Electric Association, not South Texas Electric Cooperative, Inc.  (maybe this DMS was copied and all of the changes were not made?)

I'm wondering which thing the DMS is actually for?  (is the deal # correct, or is the Counterparty S. Texas correct?)

 It looks like Michael Jacobson made some changes, so I'm guessing that the deal # is wrong and the dispute was for south texas.  If that is the case, please put in the correct deal # so that my trader's name is not on it.

Also - Michael, did you make changes to the Valley deal or to a S. Texas deal?  I need to know if my trader's book was affected. 

Please let me know.  Mark is anxious for an answer.

Thanks guys,

Virginia

Jim & Chris,

The meter file from EES, ees_20010416.dat, contained bad information for the Start and Stop Time in the Meter Header section.

EES needs to correct this problem and send a new file.

If EES does not understand what I'm talking about, they can call me.

Dear Settlements,

I'm writing to let you all know that Mike and I are working as quickly as possible on all of your outstanding DMS's.  

This month, we have had 220 new DMS's and unlike in prior months, I have not had Caroline's help to manage the number of DMS's that were entered.  My trip to Houston, as well, put me behind a week with disputes. 

Last week, we brought Mike on board to be fully dedicated to DMS.  (He's doing a great job, so please keep in mind that Mike is still new to DMS.)  Together, we hope to have everyone's DMS's finished in the near future.

Thanks for your understanding.

Virginia

At this time, we ask that you e-mail or call ONLY with absolute URGENT matters.  We will get to everyone's DMS's soon

Hi Jennifer,

Sorry this took so long.  We experienced problems while running the October 2000 numbers.  I've attached spreadsheets which include the Load Deviation numbers for production months September, November and December 2000 for both EES and PGES.   I will forward October as soon as calculations are done.

Please note that the numbers have not been actualized.  The spreadsheets are draft quality and are for information purposes only.  Please let me know if you need any additional information or have any questions.  I can be reached at 503-703-8402 (mobile).

Thanks,

Melissa,

This looks fine.   Paul Choi will again be offsetting any payments to Valley Electric, so no physical payment will be sent to them.

Just as a final cross-check to make sure we are all operating under the same understanding for Willamette, they have been paid the full amount plus an overage of $25.  They will not be receiving any additional funds on 5/31, nor will they be charged for the overage.  The amount overpaid to them will be included  in the entry for ECTstCA.  Is that your understanding as well?

Other than that, payments listed in your spreadsheet are good to go. 

Please let me know when the payments are actually released.

Thanks!

Caroline

Hi,

The Preliminary and Final Actualizations for November 2000 ISO transactions have been completed.  A Flash file has been saved in the CALISO shared folder as "1100 Settlements Final ISO_051701.xls."  This file reflects the total amount of settlement, as well as the amounts to pay or invoice based on the short-pay amount that the ISO actually paid to EPMI.  This amount will be found in column G under "New Settlement."  The amounts in column H, "Short Pay," represent the amount that we did not receive from the ISO; an accrual needs to be put in the system to account for this unpaid amount.

Please feel free to call me or Murray O'Neil if you have any questions regarding this file.

Caroline

Hi Chris,

Look at the file called Flash_06_01_2000 EES.xls.  It is saved in the directory I told you O:Portland/Westdesk/VM/VM/Jim/EES Monthly  I created a pivot table and a formula  to separate Peak from Off Peak on the flash...Look it over, it covers June 2000 and July 2000.

If this is some thing you want, it takes about 15 min per spreadsheet.  Let me know 1) if you want this kind of analysis and 2) what months and in what order you want.

Please forward this message to all members of your group and to anyone else who might benefit from this program.

Enpower IT has done an outstanding job in creating this application.  It is invaluable to me in verifying that all my deals are in Enpower correctly 
and the delivery point is balanced.  It should be very helpful to be sure that a desk, delivery point and/or region is balanced.  Please take a look 
and come by my desk for a demo if you would like.

PS - Thanks you Casey, JP, Gerald and Jason for helping me to test this application.

Rebecca

To Open:



To Run: 

1)  Enter the criteria into the filter at the top, paying close attention to whether you want Physical or Financial deals, and whether
you want to "Include Desk-to-desk" deals.  The more filter criteria you add the fast the extract will run.

2) Hit Extract




To Export:

The middle section of the application displays all the records or strips that were extracted.  This may be quickly saved to a text
file to analyze in Excel, by choosing File...Save... from the menu.


	
To Summarize and Subtotal:

The Subtotal area at the bottom of the screen, groups and subtotals the records based on the fields that are dragged 
into the gray area right below the filter (shown here in blue).  At the very bottom of the subtotal area is a GRAND TOTAL 
for all records extracted.

Pete,

Chris Stokley called me regarding Meter data on 4/29 for PGES.  What we received from the ISO does not include meter in our data base, yet below you can see there was meter for PGES.  

We ran the schedule to meter report, and the data is missing from this report.

I will also find the e-mails reporting sending this to the ISO.  We need to determine what part of the process broke down keeping the data from being reported.

Jim

Dear Mike, Diana, and Heather, 

  I wanted to let you know that I have entered the following annuities in order to account for capacity charges that were not entered into the original deal for BPA for the month of April 2001.  Detail is as follows:

ANNUITY 607843.1  (Long Term NW / Swerzbin)   This purchase annuity for $165,000.00 was entered to account for capacity charges that were not accounted for in deal # 548567.1 . 
The calculation should be 25 MW demand charge (this 25 is half of a total 50MW) x $11,000 per MW /mo.  = $275,000.00.
$110,000 was accounted for already in deal # 548567.1 and this annuity accounts for the rest)


ANNUITY 607868.1 (Short Term NW / Scholtes)  This purchase annuity for $165,000.00 was entered to account for capacity charges that were not accounted for in deal # 547839.1 . 
The calculation should be 25 MW demand charge (this 25 is half of a total 50MW) x $11,000 per MW /mo.  = $275,000.00.
$110,000 was accounted for already in deal # 547839.1 and this annuity accounts for the rest)

Please feel free to see myself or Holly Krebs for further detail on these annuities.  I also have a copy of the confirmation agreement if needed.

Thanks for you attention.

Virginia

All,
	Attached is a spreadsheet detailing the amount the ISO short-paid the market for months December - March.  I reviewed these numbers with Keoni to confirm them.  According to Keoni, the amount paid to market participants will improve, as is evidenced in the month of March, but it will be "a long time," before the ISO will be making payments in full to parties in a net-receivable position.  The ISO's ability to pay market participants relies heavily on the status of the two large utilities in California, one of which is not expected to come out of bankruptcy court for several years, among many other factors.  Also please note, when the ISO receives payment for prior months, it prorata allocates this amount across the market in the current month.  Example:  The ISO collected $2.7 million in March for the month of February, and included that in its March disbursement.

-Kit Blair

_________________

All,

At the conclusion of yesterday's meeting, I felt there was still some room for us to clarify the situation with Harbor.  I have summarized below what the Volume Management team concluded the process will be on a go-forward basis (starting in May):

1)  On the 2nd to last business day, Chris Foster will enter two annuities for the gas transaction.  The 1st annuity is for the West Gas to sell to West Services and the 2nd annuity is for West Services to sell to Harbor.  The amount of this annuity is based on the most current number Vivan Chen provides Chris and has zero financial affect on the WestServices book.

2)  On the last business day of the month, Risk calcs the month's transactions taking into account the gas annuities and the Forward power (deals which are entered on a daily basis).  Also included is the ISO Actualization for a prior month as well as an annuity entered by Chris Foster to account for the West Services shared savings for this prior month.
	-this shared savings calc is from a spreadsheet that takes into account all the costs that Harbor informs Chris Foster of 	and will never be a loss to the West Services book	

3)  20th of following month, update both gas annuities by production month

4)  25th of following month, send 2 separate invoices/payments sent to Harbor for 1) gas and 2) forward power.


For the clean-up of months prior, Chris Foster and Kourtney will go over the July through September spreadsheets in order to determine the deal entry and clean-up that needs to occur.

Please respond to all with additional comments/ammendments.

Thanks,

Kourtney

There were changes on made on 4/24 to both Settle15 and SettleSupplemental related to the rate calc.  The old versions have been copied off into the Backup directory with today's date, and the new versions have been saved as Settle15_TenMinute.xls and SettleSupplemental.xls.

Dear Laura and Alicia,

Could you guys spend a few minutes reviewing how to enter DMS's, as Mike and I have found 6 or 7 that are entered so confusingly that it takes us a longer time to figure out what the dispute is than it takes us to actually solve it.  

Please also remember that ALL DMS's that are not Counterparty changes should have a DPR impact.  All of the DMS's that I have done with your name on them this week have had a $0 Impact, when, in fact, there is a very large impact.

Thank You,

Virginia and Mike

Dear Murray,

 We have historically taken on the following counterparties for checkout:

  Montana Power - purchases and sales of imbalance energy (taken on May 2000 with prior month cleanup)
  Bonneville Power - purchases and sales (taken on Jan 2000)
  PGE     - purchases, sales, transmission (taken on March 2001 - before that, apparently Diana Scholtes helped w/ checkouts)
  Smurfit Stone -  purchases and sales (taken on December 2000 / January 2001)
  Snohomish - transmission  (taken on August 2000)
  Nevada Power - transmission (taken on May 2000)


  Since I have been with Volume Management, we have cleaned-up the following thus far:

  Pacificorp - Transmisison August 2000 thru December 2000 and Purchases and sales September 2000
  Bonneville - Transmission August 2000 thru December 2000
  Portland General - Purchases, sales, and transmission for August 2000 - September 2000 and November 2000
  

 The following have been presented as priorities for true-up to be done NOW: 

  PGE - Purchases and sales true-up for October 2000  

  PAC - We are awaiting DMS's for the October and November outstanding stuff.  - was informed of 6-8-01

  BPA - Purchases and sales true-up for June 2000 thru August 2000.  - was given 4-19-01

  CRC - Purchases and Sales true-up for December 2000 - was informed of 6-8-01

  El Paso - Purchases and sales true-up for May 2001 (Kate Symes in the Real Time group is working on this)

  Snohomish - Purchases and sales true-up for December 2000 and Jan - March 2001 - was informed of yesterday 6-11-01
 
  Dynegy - Purchases and sales true-up for September 2000  - never got trued up last year


 IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS WHERE WE STAND WITH TRUE UPS. 
 IF WE ASK HOUSTON TO HELP US IN THE RESEARCH AND TRUE-UP PROCESS, I THINK THAT THE MANUAL THAT I PUT TOGETHER REGARDING HOW TO RESEARCH DIFFERENT DISPUTE TYPES WILL COME IN VERY HANDY.

PLEASE CONTACT ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS.

Virginia

Anna,

What would it take to change Settle15 for the "IsoIe" type of 405 to make it create and store the InterchangeID?  We are still getting duplications for them, and the days that Brett has as C's can be re-done if we mess it up.  It might be faster to change the tool (we need to run it again, anyway, since we're apparently missing the wheels, right?) rather than keep messing around in the database.

What do you think?

Dear Houston Settlements,

Hope your Monday is going well.  Busy, but well (I hope).

As I am observing this Holy Week of Silence, I ask that you send all correspondence by e-mail. 
Please feel free to call me by phone when something would be better explained spokenly or when you have an urgent need, but I ask that all other correspondence from you or our counterparties be in writing this week.

Thank you for your understanding,

Virginia

Thanks, Melissa.  That clears up most of my questions.  However, on Avista, they inadvertently included their ISO bill with their October bilat transaction invoice, and the full amount was paid.  Their ISO amount was $151,686.52, which, when compared to our actual, is $13,543.24.  They should be invoiced for that amount.

I will let you know when we can schedule a conference call.  I would imagine that all of Volume Management will need to be included in the conversation.

Caroline

Caroline, 

EES & PGES are requiring further research due to intercompany transactions.  It is unclear as to what exactly needs to be reversed, re-booked, etc. until I am able to pull and research 11/00 JV's for 10/00 production.  I am working with EES on these revisions/payments.
Avista will be invoiced the total actual amount, as no one, from what I can see, has been invoiced from our end.  All invoices for counterparties will be going out as soon as we are able to complete the payments requested for 11/00 production.  It is my understanding that the payments for each month are of a higher priority than the invoices...please let us know if that has changed. 
Harbor was paid on 5/23/01 per Chris Foster's 5/21/01 spreadsheet in the amount of $185,631.38.  You may want to comunicate with him any questions you may have.  The ISO piece is included with the Gas and Energy pieces each month.  Their payments for 7/00-9/00 were also processed as such.

Again, please let me know your schedule, and who else you feel should be involved to discuss procedures for these actualizations to ensure they are processed and communicated in the most efficient manner.

Thanks, Melissa

Melissa,

I analyzed this report and have a few questions:

On Avista - Washington Water Power, were they invoiced for the $13,543.24?
On EES, I see a different actual amount than reflected in the report - my number is ($473,206) and this report shows ($707,388.86)? Also, are they invoiced on Estimates?  or should we be paying the actual only, not the difference?  It's not clear to me how they are handled.
On PGES, are they invoiced and do they pay on Estimates? Again, same question as for EES - pay actual or difference?
On Harbor, it says, "net with energy" - need clarification on how and when they will be paid.  Also, I don't show a payment based on estimates, so I show that they should receive the actual of ($192228.39) instead of the ($28,908.39) difference as shown in this report.



Thanks!

Caroline

Caroline, 

Please see the attached file for payments made on 5/21/01 (highlighted in purple.)  All were paid according to the instructions in the email below.  In the future, we will incorporate this step into our process, but I would like to schedule a conference call with you and my coordinator for sometime this week to discuss all procedures related to the settlements of the Cal ISO actualization.  As we have had two different coordinators settling this piece since we last actualized in the summer of 2000, this will probably be beneficial to both groups in ensuring that we are meeting all expectations relating to actualization and invoicing/payments.

Also, in relation to your email regarding 9/00 Actuals, we paid those counterparties that were approved for payment per your email...those that have not been paid were held per those instructions that they required special handling and that we would discuss later.  I will ensure that payment is set-up for tomorrow, 5/23/01 for those mentioned, and will send you a verification via email.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks, Melissa

Melissa,

Please send to me within the next hour a list of the customers that were paid and the amounts wired on 5/21/00.  As a part of the normal process, a complete listing with amounts is to be sent to us prior to any funds actually being wired.  This allows us an opportunity to do a final cross-check and ensures accuracy in the payments.

Thank you,

The final ISO Actualizations for October 2000 have been saved in the CALISO shared folder, and customers can be paid or invoiced according to the remaining amount shown  on the Flash file, except for the following:

Valley Electric
Colorado River Commission - Check with Paul Choi for actual amount to pay them

Please e-mail to me a listing of the anticipated payment amounts per customer prior to issuance of funds so that I may perform a final cross-check.

Thanks,

Tracy, 

I researched the Green Credits deals for 2000.  I spoke with Chris Foster and he looked at the contracts.  The prices for the months are as follows:

August: $3
September: $3
October: $3
November: $1.50
December: $1.50

Here is my record of the what the GreenCredit payments should be and I have confirmed that these match the spreadsheets on the EnronWest site:

August: $209.81 (no sheet on E'West for this month)
September: $3177
October: $3444
November: $1773.45 (I updated the E'West spreadsheet, the price was already correct in our system)
December: $1729.23

Thus, the September and October payments are incorrect due to the price variance.  I changed the deals in our system and am checking with my manager as to how we will handle paying this incremental amount. 

I calculate that we owe you $1,588.5 for September and $1,722 for October, a total payment of $3,310.50.

I will get back to you by the end of the day Friday and let you know how we will pay you for these.

Thank you for bringing this to my attention and I apologize for any inconvenience.

Kourtney

Hello,

I won't be in tomorrow until about 11:30am.  I'm taking my mother in law to the airport and wanted to use the morning to make sure she had all of her documents and luggage in order.

I have set 10/1/00-10/31/00 to A. I still need to process Prior Period Adjustments, and I have a couple of adjustments to make to Grid Management Charges.  As of tonight, we're stilll on target for the deadline. 

Kit ran all of the tools for 11/1/00-11/8/00, which he will begin actualizing tomorrow morning.  Kourtney and I set off the tools for 11/9/00-11/30/00 tonight (allexcept Settle Supplemental which has to run last).

If it turns out that I need to be here earlier than 11:30, please call me on the cell phone and I'll be head this way.

Thanks and I'll see you tomorrow,
Donna

Hi All,

Anna has made changes to these tools in the following manner:

SettleSupplemental.xls - Removed all references to calculations of 407

FTRFlash - Added new tab that shows the Total EPMI 407 Deviation position, as well as adding Intervals to the DetailData.

When all have tested and approved the changes, Anna will save them over as our Production tools.

Hi,

The Preliminary and Final Actualizations for November 2000 ISO transactions have been completed.  A Flash file has been saved in the CALISO shared folder as "1100 Settlements Final ISO_051701.xls."  This file reflects the total amount of settlement, as well as the amounts to pay or invoice based on the short-pay amount that the ISO actually paid to EPMI.  This amount will be found in column G under "New Settlement."  The amounts in column H, "Short Pay," represent the amount that we did not receive from the ISO; an accrual needs to be put in the system to account for this unpaid amount.

Please feel free to call me or Murray O'Neil if you have any questions regarding this file.

Keoni,

I'm noticing unusually high charges (see below)  in Regulation Up CT 115 in the manual tables.  The comment(s) indicate that the charges are attributed to the Soft Price Cap Allocation.  I'm not able to find any documentation on this.  Please forward any documentation you may have.

Mike,

FYI.

Geir had to buy transmisison from APS for Mirant because their trader didn't know how to and time was drawing too close real time (if no tranny bought, energy would not have gotten to where it should have.)  The date of this transaction was Sat. June 2nd, 2001 (I know the details because I was in the office when it happened.)
We don't have a deal entry function that will allow is to enter a transmission sale deal.  (since we are not a transmission provider and don't sell transmission), so this deal was entered as a purchase annuity for purchase of tranny from APS  @ $3.50 and a sale annuity to Mirant for that tranny @ $7.50.  
I have a feeling we may have to kill the purchase annuity deal and enter it as a transmission purchase but leave the sale annuity to Mirant as is. I'll let you know when I figure it out.

Just FYI.

Virginia


Chris - any suggestions?

Dear Joy,

Ryan's notebook says $115 for HE 15-16.  He spoke with Fletcher at Metropolitan.

There are 2 different values at   	HE 15:	55 MW and 45 MW =  100 MW			
				HE 16:   56 MW and 41MW  =  97 MW
And I'm seeing them both at $115.

I'll wait to hear Ryan's reply as well.

Thanks,

Virginia

Exception handling in 402 and 405 not coded properly.   Tj working on enhancing the codes to handle them correctly, and anticipates being done with 402 by tomorrow afternoon, and 405 by mid-day Wednesday.

Final actualizations for the regular charge codes are complete and set to M through October 10.

Will perform additional research into the improper allocations for 403 on Tuesday.  The unallocated volume on 10/1 is approx 300MW, so I will focus my research on that day.

Estimate completion date of all (deviations, prelim and final, and regular charge codes, final) Monday, May 7.

I have started the actualization process with 403 Load Deviation, and need to work closely with TJ on Monday to find out why the allocations don't match the variances.  I have isolated one day, zone and hour and will work on that with him.  We have got to get it working properly, or else there will be a lot of manual work required.

404 Export Deviation is complete for October, and the records can be set to A with the other days as normal.  

405 Import Deviation needs the new calcs that will be provided by a re-run of SettleSupplemental, which I am going to kick off just before I leave.  I will run that on Monday while TJ is researching the 403 errors/problems.

402 Gen Deviation will also be started on Monday.

Tentative target date for completion of Prelim's is next Thursday, and Finals on Friday.

See you Monday.

Caroline

Anna,

I just left you a message, but thought I would outline the problem that arose.  We are running the CustomerReport_update tool for the month of April for each of the generation customers.  Upon running Wheelabrat, we found that the meter is not dumping after HE 2 on April 1.  The query that pulls the meter is in the Settle database and is called "qryGenCustMeter" and when I ran it, I came back with no data.  My guess is that it all goes back to the DLS time issue.  I've looked at it as much as I could and don't know what to do to fix it.  I'm a little confused b/c you fixed a DLS time issue earlier in the month and I ran it w/out this problem.

Let me know what else you need from me.

Thanks,

Kourtney

Dear Houston Settlements,

I hope all of you had a great Easter weekend!  The weather here in Portland was actually nice for a change (it's been rainy for the past 2 weeks, although we can't complain because we desparately need the rain).

As many of you know, we will all be meeting this Wednesday in Houston to discuss DMS.  I look forward to meeting everyone face to face!

While I am away from my desk next week, there will be no one working on DMS's, as Caroline and the rest of the Portland Volume Management team are extremely occupied with California and our new systems.  I have been going DMS alone for the past month and have been trying to stay on top of everything, however, given the volume of DMS's and obligations that I have to our Portland team, I have not had a chance to review all DMS's outstanding.  My apologies for this. 

I will be working strictly on DMS's today (Monday) and tomorrow (Tuesday), and at this point, I'll ask that you send me an e-mail with any urgent or semi-urgent  DMS's that cannot wait until next week.  I will work as late as necessary tonight to finish as much as possible.

Please call if there is anything that needs to be discussed.
I'm sure I'll be hearing from you soon.

Virginia

Chris, 

This is the activity I was telling you about last week, it is on May 10th.  Let's chat about this when you get a chance.

Also, my planned vacation this summer is:

June 27-29
July 5-6

We can figure out who will help with Flash/Month End once we bring the new people up to speed.

Thanks,

Kourtney-

How would you like to come join us in beautiful California for our annual Energy
Day and represent Enron?  So what is Energy Day........

This is our 5th year of putting on it and it's getting bigger and better each
year.  We invite over 1700 kids (6th, 7th, and 8th graders) from three counties
to spend a day learning about every aspect of energy.  Because of the "energy
crisis", we have had a tremendous response.  Adults, as well as the kids, are
extremely interested in learning about what is going on the California.  We
expect this year to be the largest ever.

Our plant is transformed into an "Energy Carnival".  The kids play Energy
Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, Crossword, Word Relay, Bingo, etc...all with
questions designed to teach the kids about electricity.  We also have vendor
alley where kids are introduced to solar, wind, geothermal, and hydro companies.
Of course, we would like the natural gas industry to be represented as well.  We
are currently working to get as many vendors as possible so the kids have any
array of booths to learn from.  To add to the event, we have a presentation by
the "Fire Guy".  This is a 20 minute presentation which has proven to be the
highlight of the day.  Lastly, we have a huge BBQ to feed all the kids.  We
prepare hamburgers, and Pepsi sponsors the drinks.  Needless to say this is
quite an event.

We would love to have you come.  It's actually fun for the adults too -
especially if we have good weather.  Let me know what you think, or if I should
be contacting someone else.

Talk with you soon-

Sophia

Hi All,

Anna has made changes to these tools in the following manner:

SettleSupplemental.xls - Removed all references to calculations of 407

FTRFlash - Added new tab that shows the Total EPMI 407 Deviation position, as well as adding Intervals to the DetailData.

When all have tested and approved the changes, Anna will save them over as our Production tools.

Dear folks,

April 17 sounds OK to me.  Just wondering so I can make arrangements: How long should I plan to be in town?  Is the class for just one day? All week? Are there other classes that I should plan to sit in while I am in town? Any plans to spend a few days with the settlements team in Houston?

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Virginia,

If there are no objections, April 17th (Tuesday) seems to be a good date for our meeting here in Houston.  Could you send me an email, letting me know if this day is okay with you or another day that would be better?  Also, Rebecca and I would like to arrange a conference call with you later this week to go over topics for the meeting.  Let me know if you will be able to do this and when (A.M. vs. P.M., etc. - keep in mind our time difference).

I look forward to hearing from you,
Michael

Kit:

Delano Energy has terminated its SC and power purchase arrangement with us.  The biggest reason for this is the fact that they were purchased by AES and they do their own scheduling coordination.  Other reasons include low energy prices, our handling the PX/ISO meltdown and our internal confusion on settlements.  I hate losing customers, but given the profit potential of this account long term, I am not that upset.

At this point we need to make sure we do not get in a situation in which we have a receivable to them.   I am concerned they would not pay, given how we handled the PX/ISO meltdown.  Right now, it is my understanding that they owe us $200,000.  For the July payment due in a couple days, we should we pay them the net of what we owe them right now.  For the August payment due in Sep.  We should estimate the ISO amounts for June - August and pay them the net for Aug energy and any outstanding ISO amounts.

Thanks

Chris

Pete/Dave,

I'm not sure who needs to take care of this, but here is the issue:

On Friday, 4/6/01, the RT group did SC trades with APX3.  This is not a counterparty in CAPS, thus they entered the deals through workspace.  Thus, it was not captured in CAPS and my Enpower/CAPS report is off by this exact amount (212mw).  

The trades were:  

HE 15-22: 21mw
HE 19: 15mw
HE 20: 14mw
HE21: 15mw

Could APX3 please be added to CAPS so we can create these SC trades.  I don't mind helping do the manual work, please advise as to how I should proceed.

Thanks guys!

Kourtney

Dear Thresa, Chris, and Mike,

Please find below a composite list of changes and additions that I requested of Mike Self while in Houston.  Please let me know what change requests need to be signed off on before Mike can make any changes.

Thanks, 

Virginia


DMS Changes and additions as discussed on 4-20-01

Reports
 Put desk name and date range at the top of each type of report 

Separate out total negative DPR Impact and total positive DPR Impact and then give net DPR Impact at the end of each report
                                                                                         

Additions  

Add NONE to change type list that shows total DPR impact as "potential DPR impact", but which does not calculate this value into the net DPR impact (as presented in the reports).  For reporting purposes, this field will not be calculated, but simply appear in the report as a net total of disputes "won"
 
Add a field to the form called "Actual Trader" that is to be populated by the VM Coordinator when it has been determined which trader is responsible for the dispute

Add a section that contains 2 fields for who is correct in a dispute and who is wrong in a dispute.  These fields are to be populated by the VM Coordinator when it has been determined whether the EPMI trader or counter-party is correct 

Add "Given to trader" to the status list in the DMS form and put a time stamp that will keep track of how long the dispute was under the status of "given to trader"

Add "Newly revised" to the status list in the DMS form and put a time stamp that will keep track of how long the dispute was under the status of "Newly revised"

Add time stamp to all items in the status list in order to keep track of how long the dispute is in that status: New, pending, closed, given to trader, newly revised


Other

Make a default function that will warn the user if a west delivery point is attached to a DMS that is marked "east" and if an east delivery point is attached to a DMS that is marked "west"

Chris,
    Could you please look at this?  We are trying to determine if we should pay this or not.  It appears we withheld payment from CDWR because of the PX short payment.  Do we need to call CDWR and tell them we are not going to pay until we collect from the PX?  Amy Clemons keeps talking about an annuity that needs to put in Enpower.  Stuart seems to have no idea what to do.  In any case, I am not sure what to do with this, can you shed some light on it.  Word.

Stewart, I would like to come to an agreement on November and December payments.  The situation to date re the sharing agreement:
 
CDWR November Profit    $1,025,958.32
EPMI Paid CDWR                606,753.73
 
December Short Pay         $ 419,204.59    from EPMI's records
 
Edgar Najera of CDWR invoiced EPMI for $189,148.33 for the month of December 2000.  In addition, EPMI owes CDWR $20,500 for 82 MWs x $250/mw for HE 2200 on December 6, 2000.  CDWR delivered 275 MWs to EPMI in NP15; EPMI delivered 193 MWs to CDWR in SP15.  Total owed CDWR = $209,648.33.
 
What is the status of the December payment at this point?  The last phone conversation I had with you you indicated the $209,648.33 did not include any short pay for December.
 
Will you please get back to me and let me know what is needed to complete the November/December transactions?
 
Betty Wilson - CDWR

Hi,

The Preliminary and Final Actualizations for November 2000 ISO transactions have been completed.  A Flash file has been saved in the CALISO shared folder as "1100 Settlements Final ISO_051701.xls."  This file reflects the total amount of settlement, as well as the amounts to pay or invoice based on the short-pay amount that the ISO actually paid to EPMI.  This amount will be found in column G under "New Settlement."  The amounts in column H, "Short Pay," represent the amount that we did not receive from the ISO; an accrual needs to be put in the system to account for this unpaid amount.

Please feel free to call me or Murray O'Neil if you have any questions regarding this file.

Caroline

Dear Chris,

  This e-mail is to explain my research on the following: 

	1
   The ST_California desk's negative $903,422.49 DPR Impact for deal # 501520.1 on 1/21/01 - after speaking with Mark Confer in Houston, it seems that per the request of EES, we have made changes to this deal.  January 21, 2001 was a Sunday.  During that week in January, on-peak prices were at $321 and off peak prices were at $212. 

When deal # 501520 was originally entered, it was entered as such:

HE	MW	Price	
HE 1	471.25	 $  212.00 	
HE 2	461.75	 $  212.00 	
HE 3	456.9	 $  212.00 	
HE 4	455.03	 $  212.00 	
HE 5	457.48	 $  212.00 	
HE 6	469.6	 $  212.00 	
HE 7	488.07	 $  321.00 	
HE 8	496.05	 $  321.00 	
HE 9	510.37	 $  321.00 	
HE 10	508.1	 $  321.00 	
HE 11	518.5	 $  321.00 	
HE 12	522.58	 $  321.00 	
HE 13	525.54	 $  321.00 	
HE 14	525.82	 $  321.00 	
HE 15	525.58	 $  321.00 	
HE 16	525.52	 $  321.00 	
HE 17	524.95	 $  321.00 	
HE 18	525.73	 $  321.00 	
HE 19	525.74	 $  321.00 	
HE 20	526.73	 $  321.00 	
HE 21	525.04	 $  321.00 	
HE 22	513.96	 $  321.00 	
HE 23	501.07	 $  212.00 	
HE 24	486.22	 $  212.00 	

The bolded MW's at on-peak hours should have been entered at the Sunday off-peak price of $212, not $321, hence $212 all day.
The $321 price on the 8288.28 MW from HE 7 to HE 22 were "corrected" on 2-7-01 and the correct price of $212 was entered instead.

8288.28 MW x $109.00 price difference = $903,422.52 difference.


		2
The ST_California desk's negative $286,316.24 DPR Impact for deal # 508956.1 on 1/31/01: looks like cuts were made to the schedule.  Kate Symes is researching this with me.  It cuts are what happened, then the DPR impact should go back to zero when we find out what the other side of the deal is and we cut it too.

I've spoken to Jeff Richter about both of these deals.  He understands that the $903,422 impact is a true impact and will not be reversed.

Please contact me with any questions you may have.

Virginia

Murray and Chris,

Here is an update on what has been completed and what needs to be completed:

First, I moved the Excel "mock up" to P:\VolumeManagement\Settlement Stats

I added Murray's corrections and re-constructed the Mock Report.

In the same directory, you will find an Access Database, "Settlement Analysis DB"  I created a table and a report and a form to create a report.

There is a hard copy of the report at my desk.  

The various connections need to established, and I took a first shot at where the information is stored on the Oracle database.  The reports that I believe will populate the table are FSP_SETLMT_HISTORY_HDRS & FSP_SETLMT_HIST_DTL_QTY .  I have taken a shot at what fields I believe these come from relate to the table.

I need help in populating the tables and then some coaching on how to create a "program" feel to create a report based on selection criteria.

We can meet tomorrow to review where my work is.

Jim

Just thinking about the fact that we will all be out of the office tomorrow, so we should probably e-mail Kathy with our agenda topics for Monday's meeting today if possible.

All, 

On January 1, 2001, the CAISO retired charge type 352 - Wheeling Out/Wheeling Through due ISO.  It was replaced by 382 - High Voltage Wheeling Charge due ISO and 383 - Low Voltage Wheeling Charge due ISO.  The charges are allocated to gross exports (same as before).  The difference is the exit location.  High Voltage Access Charges are accessed for wheeling from transmission facilities with a 200 kV or higher voltage rating, while Low Voltage Access Charges are accessed for wheeling from transmission facilities with a 200kV or lower rating.

Settle 15 has been changed to capture the new wheeling charge types effective 1/1/01.  On the top sheet, Anna added a couple of cells (please see below) and changed the logic to make it date effective. 

WHEELING LV	TRUE	
January 1, 2001	TRUE	

Also on the top sheet, I changed the Wheeling ID for all low voltage tie points to differentiate between the LV and HV charges (please note the change in blue).  

Tie Points	Wheeling	From ZoneTo Zone		
BLYTHE_1_WALC	SCELV	LC2	SP15	
ELDORD_5_MCLLGH	SCE	LA2	SP15	

I've also updated tblRates in the Settle Database and added the charges to FTRflash.  If you have any questions, please ask.

Donna

Dear Alicia,

I received your fax today for detail on PGE.

I need you to go through it and highlight the discrepancies and put them into DMS.  

The systems that you have in place should allow you to identify the variances rather quickly.

Maybe Laura or Thresa could show you how to put them in the DMS system.

Please call me with any questions you have. I'll work on the DMS discrepancies as soon as I receive them.

Thanks,

Virginia
