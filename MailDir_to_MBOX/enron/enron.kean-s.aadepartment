Mark - 

Good suggestion.  I spoke to Scott Rebltiz who told me that important 
decisions are to made this week at OPIC concering the Gaza project.  I will 
work with Scott and John Hardy to make sure that our message is consistent 
and helpful.  I will also work with Mac for a comprehensive update and 
strategy.

-Chris

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

Gentlemen:  as you may have heard, I am assuming responsibility for heading 
up the government/regulatory affairs efforts beyond my current turf of Europe 
to include Africa, Asia, Australia.  This is why I generated an early e-mail 
on the Gaza project.  I am now trying to meet with my new team members, and 
clients/customers in the organisation.  I am headed to Houston on Sunday, for 
3 days of meetings, and first week of March begin a journey that will take me 
to most parts of East Asia/Australia.  Any suggestions on how (where) we get 
together, and do you think it is a high priority, or not urgent.  It is not 
that I am looking to avoid a trip, but e-mails like those below suggest that 
I can be kept well-informed without flying somewhere just to say "hello".  I 
know Mac is in Dubai.  I can fly there, or you can come to London (or are 
there others I should also meet in Dubai?).  Andrew - where are you based?  
If in Dubai, then does it make sense for me to come to you?  Sooner rather 
than later, or no urgency?  If in Houston, should we try to meet next week?  
Or are you in still some other location?  Your thoughts/views are 
appreciated.  thanks  mcs

mac-

i have a slightly different view on your point #4.  the israelis are actually 
pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the 
israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks.  the 
PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more 
access to aquifers under the land.  the isaelis want a desal project for the 
PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base, and thus 
does not need to have more land for access to more water.  the issue is that 
there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently 
reach the west bank, thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot 
point in this discussion, although it will not be due to the lack of 
rationale to their discussions.

i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in 
israel have been helpful to us.  from the macro level, there needs to be more 
proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project (due to the 
logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below).  furthermore, 
it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their 
standards to be more in line with large international transactions, as the 
local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome, and will not 
benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment.

please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.

The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule.  This 
combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in 
Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in "Palestine."  There 
are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the 
Secretary's visit.

1.  All equipment for the plant must transit Israel.  We have been assured by 
the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it 
is on the list of equipment we provide them.  That said, there are countless 
opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance, 
whether on the list or not.  First power could be delayed indefinitely if the 
Israelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons.

2.  Fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit Israel.  Again, 
disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the 
plug on power in Gaza.  Gas from Egypt has been discussed; it remains to be 
seen if that will be a reality anytime soon.

3.  Although not officially from the Israeli government, we have been told 
that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the 
Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza.  The current 
consumption is about 110MW.  The first phase of the plant will produce 40MW.  
This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel 
sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference.  That electricity is likely 
to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; Enron could well 
end up being blamed for the higher cost.

4.  Water is another critical issue.  The Palestinians want their own supply 
of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated.  Israel is currently 
selling water to Gaza; it is not in Israel's best interest to lose this 
customer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project.

5.  OPIC project funding is problematical.  Since they originally invited 
Enron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved.  
Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up 
costs.

6.  The Israelis must also "approve" the environmental impact of the plant.  
The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines, more so when operating 
on gas.  While not a probem at this point, the Israelis could delay 
construction/operation over environmental "concerns."

Andrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for 
consideration.  Thanks.  Mac

Mark - 

Good suggestion.  I spoke to Scott Rebltiz who told me that important 
decisions are to made this week at OPIC concering the Gaza project.  I will 
work with Scott and John Hardy to make sure that our message is consistent 
and helpful.  I will also work with Mac for a comprehensive update and 
strategy.

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

Miriam,

Sounds like a great growth opportunity for you.  Best of luck!  

Elizabeth,  we will need to solicit a replacement for Miriam; hopefully we 
can accomplish this prior to her leaving so that she might have time to 
transition the new person.  Ideas as to how to proceed would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks!

President's State of the Union address.

Allan will lead a group of 15 to 20 US businesses interested in clean energy 
to China, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Brazil in phase one of the initiative 
and would like Enron to be a participant. I have suggested that you were the 
appropriate senior person that should be invited to a White House meeting in 
the next two weeks regarding the program. 

He has been working with Roger Ballantine and Jeff Seabright who are his and 
Helen's contacts. They are asking Allan to head the mission. He feels that 
companies involved in this mission become recognized or further recognized as 
supporters of clean energy.

He gave me several handouts which are being faxed to you and others copied on 
this memo. You or your staff should be on the lookout for Allan or Helen's 
invitation.

Helen also asked about emissions trading and I told her about John Palmisano. 
I believe she is interested in having John brief people at the DOC on this

Subject: Stamp Tax Dispute

We used the BIT threat once before when they tried to re-trade TGS's rates in 
violation of the sales agreement. George Wasaff  can give you all of the 
details. This time we may have to go all of the way and litigate.  Tax issues 
in Argentina have also killed trading.  The problem is that the constitution 
empowers the states with all kinds of taxing authority so if you want changes 
in policies you have to have a constitutional amendment.  You can imagine the 
eagerness of politicians to take on that battle.

I will be setting up some quality time with you the week of the 21st.  Again, 
congratulations. This is an exciting and complex part of the world and I 
can't think of anyone better to bring some focusand results here.

Subject: Stamp Tax Dispute

Terry, here is the summary of the dispute.  Let me know if you would like any 
additional information, or if would would like me to put this into memo 
form.  

Argentine law imposes a stamp tax on written contracts.  In the past several 
years, the provincial governments of several of the provinces have, in an 
effort to raise desperately needed revenues, adopted a new and broader 
interpretation of the tax's application.  These provinces--Rio Negro, 
Neuquen, and Santa Cruz--have sought to apply this interpretation 
retroactively, resulting in the imposition of staggering assessments.  For 
TGS, the Enron company (40% owned) most affected, the assessments total $153 
million in taxes, $172 million in interest, and $208 million in fines.  (See 
attached chart for breakdown).

To date, court challenges to the taxes have been unsuccessful.  TGS has 
pending before the Argentine federal Supreme Court an application to declare 
the taxes unconstitutional and unlawful, but the Court has, as yet, not 
acted.  Meanwhile, the provinces are free to attempt to collect the taxes, by 
levy if necessary.  

The federal government has, in documents filed in another case, expressed the 
view that the imposition of stamp taxes in the manner folowed by the 
provinces is illegal.  Energas has also expressed its view that the taxes are 
illegal.  The federal Supreme Court, however, has recently denied an 
application (filed by another company) to enjoin collection of the taxes.
   
On November 23, 1999, Enron notified the federal government that it regarded 
the imposition of these taxes as in violation of the Bilateral Investment 
Treaty between Argentina and the U.S.  Since that notification, 
representatives of Enron and the government have held several meetings.  
Substantive discussions, however, have not yet begun.  The Treaty mandates a 
six-month cooling off period before arbitration can be initiated.  If the 
negotiations with the government are unsuccessful, Enron intends to file an 
arbitration with the International Center for the Settlement of Investment 
Disputes (ICSID) in Washington, D.C.  By way of information, Endesa currently 
has an arbitration underway at ICSID challenging the taxes, presumably under 
a BIT between Spain or Chile and Argentina.

Steve- this is a good example of something you and Mike should discuss  (the 
merits of the trip aside for a moment considering we don't have any clean 
projects inany of these countries)  can help define my role in the 
environmental area if any.  In this spirit I'd love your and Mike's thoughts. 
I did tell Joe that Mike was replacing me and had the lead in the 
environmental area. He passes his congratulations on!

Beth, Mark - 

I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of 
Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14" monitors 
per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.  Will 
try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, 
attractive look.    

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve 
Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs 
are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, 
non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have 
a 3 month implementation schedule.

Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) 
or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc.

Let me know next steps.  We can discuss funding sources.  - Bill

Subject: OECD Meetings June 26-28, Paris

Ken: While in Europe last week I arranged a meeting with Douglas Worth, 
Secretary General of the Business Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) to the 
OECD. Doug headed the Washington office of IBM until he retired a few years 
ago, then joined Carla Hills firm and two years ago became Secretary General 
of the BIAC. During his Washington service for IBM he headed up the Trade 
Committee of the United States Council for International Business to which we 
have long been a member. 

Doug and I discussed the promotion of energy services and he had several 
suggestions which I found to be excellent. He is a top level person who 
recommends policy to the OECD. He suggested that he would like to organize a 
meeting with you briefing OECD ministers and senior staff on business plans 
of today, changes in the market place and what is necessary to advance a 
business in today's atmosphere. Doug believes that having such a high level 
briefing advances the cause of business and competitive policies which is the 
priority of the OECD.

He also called my attention to the OECD Forum 2000 to be held June 26-28 in 
Paris. Doug has offered to contact Dennis Lamb, another former Washingtonian 
in the diplomatic service who is arranging the program and if you are 
available he would ask that you be a primetime speaker. It covers the type of 
issues that you addressed at the WTO in Seatlle and the World Economic Forum 
in Davos.  (I would dearly love to have a few minutes briefing from you on 
your Davos appearances).

I think these presentations at the OECD, one a private luncheon with 
Ministers that Doug thinks would be an informal presentation and the 
possibility of a slot on the June 26-28 program would be excellent for our 
cause and hope that your schedule either in June or later can accommodate 
this opportunity.

Joe

PS: Doug and his eco-staff director Ms. Hanne Rosenbaum (she knows and has 
worked with John Palmisano) told me that one of their main themes this year 
is eco-efficiency which seems to fit our Enron goals.

Spoke to Nick O'Day.  He and Paul Quilkey already have advanced ideas about 
his replacement (something half commercial/half regulatory), and possibly 
filled in the interim with a "semi-parttime" consultant.  Tom Briggs came 
into my office and is willing to relocate for a year.  I would prefer to have 
Tom there, let Paul hire whatever he needs commercially (FYI- Tom's wife is 
commercial, and probably could do a "bang up" job for Paul).  I am no 
shrinking violet (as you probably know), but have been loathe to impose 
myself/my views, at this early date, but I am not thrilled to hear that Nick 
has cooked up a solution with Paul that he and I never discussed, after you 
and I have talked about Tom, and gotten Tom's interest aroused (it seems 
unfair to Tom to tantalise him with job prospects if we are going to take 
them back; same issue I suppose you have with Terry).   I think a hybrid 
commercial/regulatory role is fine (and Tom could do it).  By the way, the 
org. charts do not show it, but Nick has a subordinate, Reg. Aff. Mgr., 
Robert McGrory, already in place.  Nick also suggested Mike Grimes going to 
Tokyo on expat assignment (discussed some time ago with Mike, but apparently 
not recently).  Your thoughts?  If you can call me after 1000 your time, 
would like to discuss.  I think you have successfully killed Terry's mass 
meeting in London.  he and I are meeting for a few hours tomorrow morning.  
thanks  mcs

The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule.  This 
combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in 
Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in "Palestine."  There 
are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the 
Secretary's visit.

1.  All equipment for the plant must transit Israel.  We have been assured by 
the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it 
is on the list of equipment we provide them.  That said, there are countless 
opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance, 
whether on the list or not.  First power could be delayed indefinitely if the 
Israelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons.

2.  Fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit Israel.  Again, 
disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the 
plug on power in Gaza.  Gas from Egypt has been discussed; it remains to be 
seen if that will be a reality anytime soon.

3.  Although not officially from the Israeli government, we have been told 
that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the 
Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza.  The current 
consumption is about 110MW.  The first phase of the plant will produce 40MW.  
This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel 
sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference.  That electricity is likely 
to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; Enron could well 
end up being blamed for the higher cost.

4.  Water is another critical issue.  The Palestinians want their own supply 
of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated.  Israel is currently 
selling water to Gaza; it is not in Israel's best interest to lose this 
customer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project.

5.  OPIC project funding is problematical.  Since they originally invited 
Enron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved.  
Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up 
costs.

6.  The Israelis must also "approve" the environmental impact of the plant.  
The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines, more so when operating 
on gas.  While not a probem at this point, the Israelis could delay 
construction/operation over environmental "concerns."

Andrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for 
consideration.  Thanks.  Mac

Mark - 

Good suggestion.  I spoke to Scott Rebltiz who told me that important 
decisions are to made this week at OPIC concering the Gaza project.  I will 
work with Scott and John Hardy to make sure that our message is consistent 
and helpful.  I will also work with Mac for a comprehensive update and 
strategy.

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

APACHI management has been successful in delaying for at least two weeks the 
signing of a renegotiated agreement for phase II of the Lagos State project, 
a 548 megawatt power plant.  This is part of the PPA that was originally 
signed and publicized in December 1999. Per our discussions, we sought a 
delay in the signing from this week to avoid undue publicity as a result of 
President Clinton's visit to Nigeria on August 26 and 27. 

There is still a risk that the Governor of Lagos may talk about the project, 
but we expect most reports to focus on the phase I emergency power barges and 
do not anticipate significant publicity about phase II.  Furthermore, Habiba 
has carefully developed an agreement on statements and minimal publicity with 
NEPA and other government agencies, which should mitigate any leaks.

Attached are the statement and Q&As we plan to use after the signing.

Jim - overnight I realised you need to add our project in Turkey (Fiona 
Grant) and Poland (Philip Davies).  I have not given you any one person, as 
the regulatory issues seem to be country/environment specific, and instead I 
have given you the names of each person with country responsibility.  Indeed, 
at year-end we completed a financial transaction (Project Margaux), in which 
regulatory risk was reviewed.  A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be 
helpful, e.g., in most of these markets, trading arrangements are being 
re-written, or developed for the first time, this put existing PPAs under 
pressure.  Would energy taxes, carbon taxes/trading, transmission pricing 
(both for evacuation of power, and delivery of gas), changes in property 
tax/fuel tax regimes, risk of price regulation, all be included?  Do you have 
checklist?  We can identify these risks, what is meant by "manage"?  We work 
on these types of issues on a daily basis, so I am unclear as to what else is 
intended or implied.  thanks  mcs

Subject: Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets

Rick & Mark --

One of the first steps in building our Regulatory Risk process is to 
establish responsibility for the current assets owned/managed by Enron.  
Having a point person that I can contact will help me immensely.

Attached is a listing of the assets that I have been able to pull together -- 
there may be more that you know about.

Is it possible for us to agree upon the person(s) who will manage the 
Regulatory Risk with each of these assets?  Please feel free to call me to 
discuss.

I would like to have this assignment process complete within the month.

The same type of effort will be necessary as we review pending transactions.

Thanks.

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

My understanding is that we want to take forward our cooperative effort with 
PNG insofar as it involves education and information sharing, but that 
capital investment is probably not in the cards.  As you probably know, 
Christopher Hunt is coming back to Singapore to meet with the commercial 
teams next week to outline Enron's commercial strategy in the region, and I 
suggest that you and I get together by phone soon thereafter.  Chris tells me 
you two have already spoken today.  Feel free to call me sooner if you wish, 
but I think Chris can paint a more complete picture than me, and then we can 
talk.   mcs

Subject: Draft PGN/Pertamina Singapore Gas Transportation Agreement

FYI.  The PGN Indonesia partnership is letting us give drafting advice on 
PGN's Gas
Transportation Agreement to Singapore.  The Indonesia to Singapore 
project is on track and PGN would like us to apply to be the strategic 
investor required by the Asian Development Bank.   ADB requirements 
would favor us because ADB is looking for transmission competency in 
the investor, not only price.  The partnership lets us demonstrate the 
competency.   See e-mail yesterday on the other three areas PGN 
encouraged Enron to invest in with them, including a marketing company.

Subject: Draft PGN/Pertamina Singapore Gas Transportation Agreement

Chris:  This is concrete confirmation of one of the items we discussed this 
morning:
that we are advising PGN on the language of their draft Gas Transportation 
Agreement
for gas to Singapore - an agreement between Pertamina, PGN, and Santa 
Fe/Gulf.  
So Enron are advising on this agreement.   Re your question about guaranteed 
volume,
it appears there are to be capacity entitlements for the shipper though these 
are
blank in this draft. 

Robert:  this is for your review and suggestions for PGN.   Please check 
whether
I am right that there will be a minimum guaranteed quantity for the 
shipper.   PGN
said it would probably be 350mmcf/day, if I understood them correctly.  

Let me know if I can help.   They need our comments asap -- before the 
workshop.

mac-

i have a slightly different view on your point #4.  the israelis are actually 
pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the 
israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks.  the 
PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more 
access to aquifers under the land.  the isaelis want a desal project for the 
PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base, and thus 
does not need to have more land for access to more water.  the issue is that 
there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently 
reach the west bank, thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot 
point in this discussion, although it will not be due to the lack of 
rationale to their discussions.

i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in 
israel have been helpful to us.  from the macro level, there needs to be more 
proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project (due to the 
logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below).  furthermore, 
it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their 
standards to be more in line with large international transactions, as the 
local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome, and will not 
benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment.

please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.

Subject: Re: Department of Energy Pre-departure Briefing w/ Asst. Secy. 
Goldwyn

The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule.  This 
combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in 
Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in "Palestine."  There 
are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the 
Secretary's visit.

1.  All equipment for the plant must transit Israel.  We have been assured by 
the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it 
is on the list of equipment we provide them.  That said, there are countless 
opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance, 
whether on the list or not.  First power could be delayed indefinitely if the 
Israelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons.

2.  Fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit Israel.  Again, 
disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the 
plug on power in Gaza.  Gas from Egypt has been discussed; it remains to be 
seen if that will be a reality anytime soon.

3.  Although not officially from the Israeli government, we have been told 
that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the 
Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza.  The current 
consumption is about 110MW.  The first phase of the plant will produce 40MW.  
This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel 
sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference.  That electricity is likely 
to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; Enron could well 
end up being blamed for the higher cost.

4.  Water is another critical issue.  The Palestinians want their own supply 
of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated.  Israel is currently 
selling water to Gaza; it is not in Israel's best interest to lose this 
customer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project.

5.  OPIC project funding is problematical.  Since they originally invited 
Enron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved.  
Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up 
costs.

6.  The Israelis must also "approve" the environmental impact of the plant.  
The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines, more so when operating 
on gas.  While not a probem at this point, the Israelis could delay 
construction/operation over environmental "concerns."

Andrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for 
consideration.  Thanks.  Mac

Mark - 

Good suggestion.  I spoke to Scott Rebltiz who told me that important 
decisions are to made this week at OPIC concering the Gaza project.  I will 
work with Scott and John Hardy to make sure that our message is consistent 
and helpful.  I will also work with Mac for a comprehensive update and 
strategy.

Joe?Chris - this covers some of my new turf.  We have, I am told, a power 
project in Gaza that we are working on.  It is probably early days, but 
perhpas Mac mcClelland in Dubai can shed some light on whether we would want 
to get that project on the Secretary of Energy's radar screen.   mcs

I talked to Schroeder: two items:

 He will call Merrill and explain things but he jest appears to be to find 
out what David wants to do and maybe explore  EBS broad band strategies in 
Singapore.  Isn't Sanjay Bhatnagar running EBS Singapore? I will also give 
Chris Hunt a heads up that Mark will talk to David first.

 Things are straightened out- Grimes and I will meet with Schroeder's people 
Thursday and spend most of the time on Japan and the rest on Korea.

Mark -

thanks for the response.

I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated wi=
th=20
either a specific asset (e.g., Sutton Bridge) or a trading book (e.g., UK=
=20
gas) is impossible.  We could have 50 people spending 100% of their time=20
sitting around dreaming up 'what-ifs' and still not see everything.  On the=
=20
other hand, as your team does now, once we have been able to identify=20
reasonable risks, it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute /=20
calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks. =20

On the flip side of the risk coin, the process of identifying Regulatory Ri=
sk=20
should also allow Govt Affairs, working with our business colleagues,  to=
=20
identify rule changes / policy changes that could positively impact our=20
bottom line.  For instance, we could push through regulatory action for a=
=20
retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin.

I don't disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business=
=20
risks.  But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory poli=
cy=20
(taxes, export/import, rates, etc.).  Because Enron is actively participati=
ng=20
in many regulated or semi-regulated environments, regulatory risks are=20
business risks. =20

Finally, it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in=
=20
assisting our business people in managing these risks.  To this end, the=20
Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of=20
responsibilities for Govt Affairs:

_ To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets.=20
_ To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks.=20
_ To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Ris=
k.
_ To assess and compute =01&value at risk=018 for each Regulatory Risk.
_ To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk (e.g., insurance).
_ To propose and/or plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks.
_ To assign EGA and/or commercial responsibility and resources for mitigati=
on=20
efforts.
_ To review mitigation efforts against existing plans.
_ To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk (e.g., BIT=
).
_ To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events (> $25 MM).=20
_ To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position.=20
_ To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron.

I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this=20
further.  Like you, I don't want to create some process that provides littl=

David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance To Save Energy called this evening 
to say that Enron was being considered for one its that groups annual awards 
but that he needed an "edge" to sell it to the committee. He knows that we do 
energy services, wind and energy efficiency but was told by the committee 
that others do energy efficiency. Therefore, he has asked me if we can give 
him a specific item he can use that separates us from other leaders in energy 
efficiency. Can you help? Joe

As an organisational announcement is imminent, and it is no secret, that I 
will be assuming responsibility for Asia (including Japan), Africa, and 
Australia, I am planning to fly to Houston on Sunday, 13 Feb., and would like 
to meet each of you, either because you will become a direct report, or a new 
customer.  I will have my assistant, Sharon, coordinate times.  I will look 
forward to the prospect of meeting each of you.  Should your schedule not 
allow a meeting this time, I will be back in Houston on Monday 13 March.  If 
you know of anyone else I should meet, but have inadvertently omitted from 
this list, please feel free to advise Sharon, as well.   thanks  mcs

Sharon - for many of these people I can go their offices, but see if Maureen 
can find a space I can land for meetings, as some will not have offices.

any event, given our discussion yesterday, do we really want to be jumping 
through hoops for this Indonesian gas firm.  Jane Wilson did mention to me 
yesterday that we were pursuing a JV.  Is that off or likely to be put off,

PGN requires the following soonest:

      by our Jakarta office.  They will be supplying some 350MMCF/day
      to Singapore by 2002.  They need to finish this document this month.
      They request us to make suggested changes directly on the
      text with comments and explanations shown in the margins.

2.   Any papers we have summarizing the principles of gas transportaton
     agreements -- including cross-border agreements.

3.  Laws/language on third party access to pipelines from other
     countries (along with their pros and cons).  They
      need this to help them draft the thrid party access provisions
      for the new Oil and Gas law on which comments are due shortly.

Following is being sent to you by DHL:

4   Copies of the training program on regulatory affairs done for PGN by
     NERA last May.  [confidential].   This is so you and Jane will know
     what PGN already has been taught and not to go over the same ground.

5.   Copies of the advice on a regulatory regime for gas provided to PGN

Jim - overnight I realised you need to add our project in Turkey (Fiona 
Grant) and Poland (Philip Davies).  I have not given you any one person, as 
the regulatory issues seem to be country/environment specific, and instead I 
have given you the names of each person with country responsibility.  Indeed, 
at year-end we completed a financial transaction (Project Margaux), in which 
regulatory risk was reviewed.  A definition of Rugulatory Risk would be 
helpful, e.g., in most of these markets, trading arrangements are being 
re-written, or developed for the first time, this put existing PPAs under 
pressure.  Would energy taxes, carbon taxes/trading, transmission pricing 
(both for evacuation of power, and delivery of gas), changes in property 
tax/fuel tax regimes, risk of price regulation, all be included?  Do you have 
checklist?  We can identify these risks, what is meant by "manage"?  We work 
on these types of issues on a daily basis, so I am unclear as to what else is 
intended or implied.  thanks  mcs

Subject: Assignment of Regulatory Risk Responsibility for Current Assets

Rick & Mark --

One of the first steps in building our Regulatory Risk process is to 
establish responsibility for the current assets owned/managed by Enron.  
Having a point person that I can contact will help me immensely.

Attached is a listing of the assets that I have been able to pull together -- 
there may be more that you know about.

Is it possible for us to agree upon the person(s) who will manage the 
Regulatory Risk with each of these assets?  Please feel free to call me to 
discuss.

I would like to have this assignment process complete within the month.

The same type of effort will be necessary as we review pending transactions.

Thanks.

Subject: Department of State Personnel Joining Enron's Washington Office In 
June

American Foreign Service Association President Marshall Adair called to 
advise that of the 10 foreign service officers now in economic training at 
the Foreign Service Institute, 7 of the 10 had indicated an interest in join 
ing Enron's Federal Affairs office for the newly instituted Business 
Practicum. Marshall asked that I call Tom Martin, deputy director of the 
Office of the Business Coordinator which I did.

I agreed that we would take two of the foreign service officers.   Tom 
Pierce's last post was in Amman, Jordan where he headed the commercial 
section at the embassy as senior economic officer. Following the Business 
Practicum, he will be joining the Office of the Business Coordinator which is 
an excellent fit for us. He had prior assignments in Melbourne and Ecuador 
where he did counsellor work. He worked at Case-Harvester in sales and 
marketing and has an MBA.

Rob Winchester will be going to one of the "stans" after the Business 
Practicum. His earlier foreign service assignments include regional economic 
office in Washington with the East Asia Bureau, DOS Operations Center, 
Malayasia and Romania counsellor assignments.

I've agreed to accepting both and will be assigning one to each of you. 
Carolyn will need to get them an office in the expansion space at Rome.

Joe

P.S. I think we should organize some briefing materials and take them to 
lunch so they can be oriented before arrival.

Do you have a list of ongoing projects the Southern Cone Gov't Affairs group 
is engaged in?  Please forward to me if you do.( If something does'nt already 
exist, perhaps you could pull something together at your earliest convenience 
) Also, any information as to relative priority of these projects and level 
of resources ( both internal and external ) you have committed by project 
would be helpful. I look forward to getting down to Sao Paulo soon to visit 
with you and your group. Hope your move goes  uneventfully. Thanks for all 
your help.

In advance of my visit next week, could you please prepare a list of priority 
activities currently underway in your goup( domestic and international ) with 
some sense of the level of  resources being committed to each of those 
activities( internal and external resources ) ?  What might also be helpful 
with respect to each of those activities are short, mid, and long-term

I have arranged a tentative agreement with Bowne Business Solutions (13th 
floor graphics) to provide content digitization, encoding and storage for 
video productions.  They will have the capability to output from S-VHS, Beta 
SP and electronic sources, along with minimal editing and creation of basic 
multimedia images suitable for the Enron channel.  Additional costs would be 
incurred by individual departments incrementally as they produced video 
content for the monitors.  Enron would then have a choice of vendors, 
including the in-house graphics group, Innovision (Beth Stier) and others.

We also need to determine the point of demarcation for the "head-end" of the 
video signal for these and any other building monitors.  I don't know if your 
estimates include any of this head-end equipment which would include VTRs, 
modulators, distribution amplifiers, CATV contracts and receivers, satellite, 
etc.  Regardless, we need to talk to the folks who will be producing content 
for these monitors to see what types of capabilities they want to have.

Finally, someone will have to "own" the channel and pre-approve content for 
distribution.  I'm pretty certain that Mark Palmer wants to control the 
content, though I don't think that he wants to manage the production group, 
or create any overkill.

I'd be happy to discuss alternatives with all of you for the content side of 
this project.  Again, I think that the costs will be incremental expenses 
related to creating content rather than capital outlay.

Beth, Mark, Pam, Setev, Terrie, et al. - Are you interested in addressing 
what in-house capabilities you'd like to have with me?

Subject: Video Screens in EB Elevator Cabs

Beth, Mark - 

I think we are ready to move on implementing flat screen monitors in all of 
Enron Building passenger elevator cabs, i.e. proposal is for two 14" monitors 
per cab, one for Corporate content, other for local Houston messages.  Will 
try to flush mount them in the stainless steel cab panels, for a clean, 
attractive look.    

Technical details have generally been worked out between our group (Steve 
Woods and Harry Grubbs) and Enron's IT Dept.  such that  we know total costs 
are below $500K (more in $350-400K range plus whatever temporary, 
non-elevator monitors appropriate for Three Allen Center occupants).  We have 
a 3 month implementation schedule.

Content can be anything available on Enron's LAN (developed @ the desk top) 
or any video signal, i.e. Cable TV stations, tapes, etc.

Let me know next steps.  We can discuss funding sources.  - Bill

Mark --

Thanks for the additions.  I will add to the Asset / Responsibility Matrix.

The definition I have been using is that Regulatory Risk is a subset of 
Sovereign Risk (with the other element being Political Risk).  Regulatory 
Risk is a "legal" action taken by a government or its agent which modifies 
Enron's business environment, most often directly through modifications in 
the energy and communications markets, but also in broad areas such as taxes 
and export - import policies.  Political Risk is a "supra-legal" action that 
has the same impact (e.g., expropriation).

Currently the Regulatory Risk Working Group (Fiona Grant is member) is trying 
to put in place a "standard" process to review and analyze regualtory risk 
around the globe - quite an undertaking.  When I use the term Regulatory Risk 
Management, I am primarily talking about such a process.  The key elements of 
any risk management function are (1) identification, (2) assessment, (3) 
mitigation / transference, and (4) audit.  You would probably agree that the 
most difficult problem is to try and assess the impact of any Regulatory Risk 
event.  The other key goal is to have a Mitigation Plan in place with an 
assigned person to "manage" our activities so that Enron does not face an 
associated loss.

My goal is to try an have this process in place by mid-year.  That would 
include having undertaken a structured review of our current Assets (the 
reason for the original questions) and the ability to review pending deals. 

When you come over to Houston next week I would really like to sit down and 
go through my thoughts with you.  

Thanks.

JDS

FYI, the attached press release announcing a fiber exchange is scheduled to 
be issued tomorrow by Qwest, however EBS is not named in the release (due to 
sensitivities with the pending USWest deal).  Under the terms of the 
exchange,  we gave them access on our Denver-to-Dallas route and we received  
New Orleans to Jacksonville via Tallahassee; Jacksonville to Charlotte; and 
Tallahassee to Louisville via Atlanta and Nashville.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

While it doesn't mention Enron, the 1000 mile route spoken to was acquired in 
a fiber exchange with Enron.  Let's discuss. thx,

Kris-
Attached is the latest Qwest release, with the changes I mentioned last
night.  I will call you later to discuss, but the bottom line for us is that
we have to disclose this information in writing prior to our analyst meeting
next week, and Friday is now our only window.  As before, there are no
references to Enron.
Thanks-

 I have worked for Enron for 8 1/2 years.  For what it is worth, I really 
enjoyed the recent "Ode to Why" commercial.  The imagery of past struggles 
shown with short video-clips was first class.  When I saw the ad on TV, it 
caught my attention and I knew I liked it even before I realized it was an 
Enron commercial.  Congratulations on what I believe is the best 
advertisement I have seen yet for Enron.  

  I read a brief article this morning that you may find of interest.  The 
name "Enron" will appear in Microsoft's spell-check dictionary in its Word 
2000 release.  Enron is certainly becoming a household name!
