Steve, this may change our strategy but we could probably still sound off on 
the BGE lawsuit.

Subject: Update on Legislative situation re Hefley amendment

This should be kept confidential.

I am advised from one staff source, who is involved in the House-Senate
negotiations, of the following:

--House and Senate staff met yesterday to discuss the Hefley amendment;

--They agreed to try a certain approach;

--Phil Grone (Rep Hefley's staffer) will prepare a written 'offer' for the
Senate staff;

--That offer might be the Senate amendment plus statutory language
authorizing the Secretary to select/mandate certain state health and safety
regualtions to follow;

--The 'offer' is expeced between now and next Tuesday (9/5);

--There will be a Members meeting on this and other issues next Wednesday
(9/6);

--DOD has not yet signed off (and in fact there is no agreement until
everyone see the language -- and there is always the possibility that Grone
might try to broaden the language to include other susbjects).

--IF there is House, Senate and DOD agreement, the issue could be resolved
at the Members meeting; however, nothing is written in stone until the
Congress actually votes on the Defense Authorization Conference Report.

CONCLUSIONS I reach:

1. We should be careful of any activity that would pressure Mr. Hefley, his
staff or make this a personal issue between now and next Wednesday; let
Grone prepare his 'offer'.

2.  We may want to slow-walk the Tom White/Dick Cheney call until we get a
better handle from DOD and Hill staff on developments over the next few
days.

3. We should continue broad-based yet low-key efforts between now and next
Wednseday to show support for the Senate position -- targeting key
Senators/staff and selected House Memebers/staff -- utilizing CSA, COOPs
and BENZ, at al.; keep the Enron profile low.

4.  We need to talk re how to assure that we have imput to DOD's review of
the Grone 'offer'; the TomWhite/CSA meeting with Secretary Yim may be
timely.

5.  If there is an acceptable agreement our strategy changes to one of
holding it.

6. I will run the traps again tomorrow and report if new information.

7.  We will all talk Tuesday at 0900 EST.

Attached are the BGE filings at the US District Court in Baltimore.  They are 
seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, both of which were summarily 
rejected by Judge Matsch in Denver, who is treating CSU's claim as an APA 
review. They are also making virtually identical legal claims as CSU - their 
central claim is that they have the exclusive right to operate electric and 
gas systems inside Fort Meade. BGE has also brought in the issue of state 
jurisdiction over other entities such as EFSI:  they cite an opinion letter 
from the General Counsel of the MD PSC as an "official decision"  - which it 
is not.  In any case, Randy Rich and I had  subsequent meeting with GC 
regarding that letter in which she "clarified" her position in various 
respects contrary to BGE's claims.  But I see that aspect of BGE's complaint 
as favorable from our standpoint - the District Court can rule on this issue 
instead of the state courts.  Vicki/Andrew, please let me know how you want 
to proceed.  I have a few ideas that we could discuss with whomever handles 
the case as outside counsel.    -Bob 3-3180
