COURT SEES NO DUTY TO BARGAIN FOR SUBSIDIARIES OPERATING
"NEW YORK POST"

Two companies that successively operated the "New York Post
" were not required to recognize and bargain with the
Newspaper Guild of New York, the Second Circuit rules
("Newspaper Guild of N.Y. v. NLRB,  "2d Cir.,  No. 00-4222,
8/10/01).

Affirming the National Labor Relations Board's ruling in
favor of NYP Acquisition Corp. and NYP Holdings Inc., Judge
Jacobs holds that the board was reasonable in finding that
NYP Acquisition--launched in 1993 to manage the
then-bankrupt newspaper--and NYP Holdings--later launched to
buy the paper--were not alter egos because they played
different transactional roles and had different financial
and strategic purposes. Nor were the two subsidiaries of
Rupert Murdoch's News American Publishing Inc. a single
employer, the court holds, because they did not operate
concurrently. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-21

TEXAS COURT UPSETS $5.8 MILLION VERDICT FOR FORMER AMERICAN
EAGLE PILOT

The Texas Court of Appeals overturns a more than $5.8
million judgment for a former American Eagle pilot who
claimed he was fired for refusing to fly in an ice storm
("Simmons Airlines d/b/a American Eagle v. Lagrotte, "Tex.
Ct. App., No. 05-00-00656-CV, 8/3/01). The appeals court
decides the trial court should not have allowed Michael
Lagrotte to bring a wrongful discharge tort claim when he
was covered by a collective bargaining contract that
specified he could only be fired for "just cause," and he
had access to grievance/arbitration procedures to challenge
his discharge. Lagrotte filed a grievance but withdrew it,
opting instead to go to court.

A jury in the Dallas County District Court found American
Eagle acted with malice in terminating Lagrotte for the sole
reason that he refused to perform an illegal act. The jury
awarded $2,354,504 in actual damages and $7 million in
exemplary damages, but the trial judge reduced the exemplary
damages to $3,459,008. The trial judge denied the company's
motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a
new trial. . . . Page A-1

FIRM NOT LIABLE FOR OVERTIME DESPITE POLICY OF CUTTING PAY
FOR SICK LEAVE

An office manager and bookkeeper fails to convince the Tenth
Circuit that because of her employer's policy of reducing
pay for sick leave under certain circumstances she was
eligible for overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act
("Gagnon v. Resource Tech. Inc., "10th Cir., No. 00-2410,
8/13/01). The court rejects Gloria Gagnon's contention that
she did not meet the conditions of the salary test used to
determine if she was employed in an administrative capacity
and therefore exempt from the overtime requirements of the
FLSA.

 The employer's sick leave policy did not defeat the salary
test because Gagnon failed to show that a "reduction in pay
for less than one day of sick leave would have been applied"
to employees such as herself, the court says. The Supreme
Court has held that the salary test denies exempt status
when employees are covered by a policy that permits
deductions in pay for certain reasons, such as use of sick
leave for absences of less than one day. However, Gagnon
"does not allege that any deductions were made" or that her
employer "had a policy or practice of deductions, nor does
the record suggest any reason to infer such a policy," the
court says. . . . Page A-7

JUDGE RULES DIAL CASE CAN PROCEED AS PATTERN-OR-PRACTICE
CLAIM

A federal judge rules that the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission may proceed to trial with charges of sexual
harassment at Dial Corp.'s  Aurora, Ill., soap production
plant and denies most of the company's petition for summary
judgment ("EEOC v. Dial Corp., "N.D. Ill., No. 99 C 3356,
8/9/01).

In a 46-page decision, Judge Urbom rejects the bulk of
Dial's arguments for disposal of the EEOC's lawsuit alleging
that Dial Corp. tolerated a pattern or practice of sexual
harassment and sex discrimination at the Aurora facility
dating back to July 1988. The decision paves the way for a
trial in a sexual harassment case that an EEOC official
predicts could be EEOC's biggest since its landmark
litigation against Mitsubishi Motors Manufacturing of
America Inc. . . . Page A-2,  Text E-1

COURT ALLOWS CLAIMS THAT UNITED HEALTHCARE USED FAULTY
UCR-CHARGE DATA

The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New
York rules that claims can proceed alleging that United
Healthcare breached its Employee Retirement Income Security
Act fiduciary duties by knowingly relying on inaccurate data
for establishing usual, customary, and reasonable charges in
determining benefits ("American Med. Ass'n v. United
Healthcare Corp., "S.D.N.Y., No. 00 Civ. 2800 (LMM),
7/31/01).

The suit was brought against United Healthcare and its
affiliates by health plan participants, including
participants in American Airlines' employee health plan, the
American Medical Association, the Medical Society of the
State of New York, the Missouri State Medical Association,
and two medical care providers who treated plan participants
as "out-of-network providers."

The suit alleged that although United Healthcare is
obligated to collect and maintain "usual, customary, and
reasonable" data to support its decision to reimburse
out-of-network physicians, it "does not in fact possess UCR
data to substantiate its claims that certain fees are
greater than the usual and customary charge for such
treatment and cannot justify reimbursement at the lower
rates that United Healthcare had been reimbursing
out-of-network physicians." The court finds the allegations
sufficient to state a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
However, it dismisses a claim for relief and says the
plaintiffs cannot seek the recalculation of their benefits.

REPORTER'S TYPING, WRITING RESTRICTIONS NOT LIMITING UNDER
ADA

A newspaper reporter who was fired because a repetitive
stress disorder made her unable to type or write for
extended periods of time is not limited in a major life
activity under the Americans with Disabilities Act, the
Ninth Circuit rules in a 2-1 decision ("Thornton v.
McClatchy Newspapers Inc., "9th Cir., No. 99-15857,
8/15/01).

Finding that "Fresno Bee" features reporter Jacalyn Thornton
was not limited in the major life activity of performing
"manual tasks" despite impairments that significantly
limited her ability to type or write, the court holds that
"manual tasks" included a broad range of activities and that
she could perform those tasks, and thus other jobs. "That
Thornton could perform certain manual tasks for only a
limited amount of time does not present a triable issue that
she was 'substantially limited' in a broad range of manual
tasks," Judge Hawkins says. Hawkins points out that Thornton
could grocery shop, drive, make beds, do laundry, and dress
herself, all manual tasks that demonstrated she was not
significantly limited under the ADA.

 Judge Berzon dissents, saying the majority's finding
ignores the increasing reliance on computers in today's
society. "The sum of the matter is that the ability to use
one's arms and hands to operate a computer and handwrite is,
in the modern world, a skill that is essential both in
getting an education and in earning a living, and is useful
in carrying out many activities of daily living," Berzon
writes. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-7

MINNESOTA COURT AGREES TEAMSTERS LIABLE TO OVERNITE FOR
STRIKE DAMAGE

Teamsters Local 120 is liable for damage to an Overnite
Transportation Co. facility in Blaine, Minn., caused by
striking employees who were not union members and for
two-thirds of the company's increased security costs, the
Minnesota Court of Appeals rules ("Overnite Transp. Co. v.
Teamsters Local 120, "Minn. Ct. App., No. C3-01-153,
"unpublished opinion" 8/14/01 ). Although the union was
certified to represent employees at the Blaine facility in
1995, most or all of the workers are not union members
because the union promised not to charge initiation fees or
union dues until it reached a collective bargaining
agreement with the company, which still has not occurred.

Affirming a district court decision, the appeals court finds
the union had an agency relationship with the picketers and
therefore was vicariously liable for the damage caused by
the picketers' misconduct during the strike that began in
October 1999. "[T]he evidence indicates that while the union
was aware of the picketers' repeated acts of misconduct, it
was either 'unwilling or unable to take the necessary steps
to control its pickets,' " Judge Foley says. . . . Page A-8

NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER PRECLUDES MAINTENANCE WORKERS' JOB
COMPLAINT

Maintenance workers who were denied the right of first
refusal to continue working in a federal building when a new
service contract was awarded are precluded by a recent
executive order from appealing the job denial to the Labor
Department ("Eddis v. LB&B Associates, "DOL ARB,No. 01-086,
8/8/01). President Bush's executive order withdrawing
certain hiring restrictions that previously had been imposed
when government agencies changed service contracts did not
include any language "suggesting that cases pending at the
time the order was issued could be litigated further," the
Labor Department's Administrative Review Board rules.

Bush's executive order rescinded a 1994 executive order that
required that contractors who took over custodial and other
services in federal buildings from another contractor give
that contractors' employees the right of first refusal on
jobs for which they were qualified. In considering a 1999
complaint alleging a violation of that order, the review
board says the Bush executive order did not include a
"savings clause" preserving its jurisdiction over cases
pending under the old order. Nor did the Labor Department's
move to rescind the regulations implementing that order
include such language, the board says. . . . Page A-2

COURT REJECTS BID FOR EXEMPTION FROM FAA'S AGE-60 RULE

The Seventh Circuit rejects the bid of a group of older
commercial airline pilots who sought exemptions from the
Federal Aviation Agency's longstanding rule prohibiting
flying after the age of 60 ("Yetman v. Garvey, "7th Cir.,
No. 99-2821, 8/14/01).

The 69 pilots, all of whom were either approaching or had
reached the age of 60, argued that more flexibility was
warranted in light of recent advances in medical technology.
FAA has never granted such an exemption in the 42 years that
the policy has been in effect.

"The FAA has the discretionary power to establish a rigid
policy, whereby no exemptions are granted, until it is
satisfied that medical standards can demonstrate an absence
of risk factors in an individual sufficient to warrant a
more liberal exemption policy from the age-60 rule," Judge
Flaum writes for the appeals court. "Until the FAA
determines that such standards exist, it may adhere
inflexibly to a rule whose validity has been upheld by the
courts and reevaluated by Congress, so long as it continues
to consider, as we are satisfied it has done here, new
advances in medical technology." . . . Page A-1

FIFTH CIRCUIT FINDS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR QUALIFIES AS
ERISA BENEFICIARY

Overturning a jury award of $100,000 against Provident Life
and Accident Insurance Co., the Fifth Circuit finds an
independent contractor qualifies as a beneficiary under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("Hollis v.
Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co., "5th Cir., No.
99-60877, 8/8/01).

In a case of first impression in the circuit, the Fifth
Circuit joins other appeals courts to decide the question
and rejects J.L. Hollis's claim that as an independent
contractor, he was not an ERISA beneficiary.  "Hollis's
independent contractor status does not preclude him from
being a beneficiary," the Fifth Circuit says. "Because
Hollis is an ERISA beneficiary, his claims directly affect
the relationship between traditional ERISA entities.
Therefore, ERISA preempts Hollis's state law claims against
Provident for bad-faith denial of disability benefits."  . .

TWO NLRB RULINGS ON ALLIEDSIGNAL REACH DIFFERENT RESULTS IN
D.C. CIRCUIT

In two decisions involving AlliedSignal's acquisition of
operations at an Army engine plant in Stratford, Conn., a
federal appeals court upholds a National Labor Relations
Board ruling that the company illegally terminated
collectively bargained severance benefits, but overturns a
separate board ruling that the company improperly ended a
side agreement.

The District of Columbia Circuit agrees with the board that
AlliedSignal, which has since been acquired by Honeywell
International Inc., committed an unfair labor practice by
unilaterally terminating severance benefits when an
agreement expired with the United Auto Workers regarding the
effects of AlliedSignal's acquisition ("Honeywell Int'l Inc.
v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1171, 6/29/01). Finding no
bargaining impasse or union waiver, the appeals court
decides AlliedSignal was barred from making unilateral
changes regarding severance benefits, a mandatory subject of
bargaining. The second ruling involves AlliedSignal's
termination of a competitiveness agreement containing job
protections. The appeals court decides the issue only
involves contract interpretation, which is for arbitrators
and the courts to decide ("Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. NLRB,
"D.C. Cir., No. 00-1170, 6/29/01). . . . Page AA-1

NURSING HOME WORKER WINS FMLA CLAIM, MAY PROCEED WITH ADA
SUIT

A Pittsburgh nursing home violated the Family and Medical
Leave Act when it fired a former assistant nursing director
who took medical leave after being diagnosed with clinical
depression, the U.S. District Court for the Western District
of Pennsylvania holds ("Wilson v. Lemington Home for the
Aged, "W.D. Pa., No. 99-1893,  6/25/01).

Marva J. Wilson gave the Lemington Home for the Aged
adequate notice that she needed to take the leave, but the
employer failed to provide her with a written notice of her
legal obligations, the company's expectations of her under
its FMLA policy, and any consequence she might face for
failing to meet these expectations, Judge Ambrose rules,
granting Wilson summary judgment on her FMLA claims. Ambrose
also denies the employer's bid for summary judgment on
Wilson's claim that she was discriminated against in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. . . . Page

OSHA PLANNING TO EXPAND INJURY SURVEY TO CONSTRUCTION IN
2002

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration plans to
expand its mandatory injury survey in 2002 to target between
15,000 and 20,000 construction companies, OSHA officials
tell BNA. The expansion would represent the first look at an
industry that so far has eluded a data-gathering effort,
begun by the Clinton administration nearly five years ago.

The plan, which one OSHA source says will be outlined in a
"Federal Register" notice slated for publication in late
July, is scaled back from a proposal unveiled a year ago to
survey about 56,000 construction companies in 2001. The
"Federal Register" notice is expected to seek comments on
the proposal as the first formal step toward implementing
the construction survey. . . . Page A-3

NO ERISA BAR TO PHARMACIST'S STATE CLAIMS OVER CVS'S HIRING
DATE

Reversing a lower court,  the North Carolina Court of
Appeals finds no preemption under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act on a pharmacist's state law action
alleging retail drug chain CVS breached a contract and
engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices by selecting
an improper hire date for calculating his pension benefits
("Vaughn v. CVS Revco D.S. Inc., "N.C. Ct. App., No.
COA00-159, 7/3/01).

Pharmacist William Edward Vaughn's state law claims do not
attempt to require an employee benefit plan to provide
particular terms or to regulate the types of benefits the
plan must provide, the appeals court says.  Rather, Vaughn's
"claims simply seek to enforce, or secure compensation for
the breach of an alleged agreement as to the date of hire
for purposes of determining plaintiff's pension benefits,"
the court says.

 Vaughn was hired by Revco drug stores on Feb. 15, 1972; in
August 1995 CVS acquired Revco.  Vaughn alleged that CVS in
hiring him confirmed by letter that he would "retain [his]
tenure showing a date of hire of February 15, 1972," and
"[a]ll benefits will be applicable per [his] tenure." Vaughn
brought suit in a North Carolina state court, however, after
CVS agents later told him his pension benefits would be
calculated as of the date he was hired by CVS in 1995. . . .

CARPENTERS, MASON TENDERS NEGOTIATE FIVE-YEAR CONTRACTS IN
NEW YORK

New five-year collective bargaining agreements went into
effect July 1 for at least 19,000 union carpenters and mason
tenders in the five boroughs of New York City.

The Carpenters and Joiners District Council of New York and
Vicinity negotiated separate agreements with the Building
Contractors Association of New York and the Association of
Wall-Ceiling and Carpenters Contractors of Long Island and
New York City. Both agreements provide wage and fringe
benefit increases of $14.52 per hour over the contract term.
The agreements cover at least 9,000 workers.

BCA also concludes a separate five-year agreement with the
Mason Tenders District Council of the Laborers International
Union that provides wage and benefit increases totaling
$7.50 per hour over term for approximately 10,000 workers in
the five boroughs of New York City. . . . Page A-4

SECOND CIRCUIT RULES NYTEL-CWA PACT ON DUES PAYMENTS
UNENFORCEABLE

Communications Workers of America Local 1100 cannot enforce
an agreement with New York Telephone Co. calling for the
company to make monthly payments equal to the dues the union
would have collected if the company had not used nonunion
temporary workers, the Second Circuit rules ("New York
Telephone Co. v. Communications Workers of Am. Local 1100,
"2d Cir., No. 00-9182, 7/5/01).

Vacating an arbitration decision in the union's favor, the
appeals court affirms a federal district court decision that
the agreement violates the Labor-Management Relations Act's
prohibition on employer payments to unions. The appeals
court decides the payments do not fit statutory exceptions
for deducting dues from employees' wages or paying an
arbitration award. . . . Page AA-1

HOSPITAL MAY HAVE TITLE VII LIABILITY FOR PATIENT'S SEXUAL
ASSAULT OF DOCTOR

A Kansas psychologist who was sexually assaulted by a
patient can sue her former employer, a Topeka mental health
center, for violating Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act
by failing to take reasonable measures to protect her from a
hostile environment created by sexually aggressive patients,
the Tenth Circuit rules ("Turnbull v. Topeka State Hospital,
"10th Cir.,  No. 00-3086,  7/5/01).

Reversing a trial court's judgment as a matter of law for
the now-defunct Topeka State Hospital, Judge Seymour holds
that a reasonable jury could find that Cynthia Turnbull
presented enough evidence that the hospital knew or should
have known that the patients were creating a sexually
hostile environment but did not take appropriate remedial
steps to address the dangers their behavior created. . . .

UNION MEMBERS AT DISNEY WORLD APPROVE THREE-YEAR CONTRACT

Members of six union locals representing hourly employees at
Walt Disney World Co. approve by nearly a 2-1 margin a new
three-year contract covering some 25,000 workers at the
Orlando, Fla., entertainment complex. The accord raises the
new-hire rate by 35 cents to $6.70 per hour, enhances the
pension benefit for long-term employees, limits the amount
of health-care premium increases that can be passed on to
employees, and commits Disney to remaining neutral in any
union organizing among currently unrepresented part-time
employees.

The new agreement continues the two-tier wage structure
first included in the contract during the last round of
negotiations in 1998.  Employees on the first tier, hired
before Dec. 12, 1998, who are at the top of the five-year
wage scale, will receive a 2 percent increase retroactive to
April 1, a $1,000 lump-sum cash payment in October, and lump
sums of $1,500 in October 2002 and 2003. For second-tier
employees hired after Dec. 12, 1998, the new contract
upgrades the wage rates at the various steps of the
progression, establishing a five-year top rate of $8.57 per
hour as of July 2004. . . . Page A-1

LTV, CREDITORS, UNION SEEK COURT APPROVAL OF TENTATIVE
CONTRACT

LTV Corp. announces its approval of a tentative labor
contract reached between the company's creditors and the
United Steelworkers that would allow the steel producer to
restructure itself. On the same day, a bankruptcy court
judge sets a July 30 hearing to consider approval of the
agreement.

The tentative agreement would provide the company with
millions in savings through restructuring work arrangements
as well as restructuring health care to reduce costs. It
also would eliminate significantly more steelworker jobs
than the company originally had proposed, but would give
union members 20 percent ownership, two seats on the board
of directors, and profit sharing, once LTV returns to
profitability. . . . Page A-7

ATF, CHEMICAL SAFETY PANEL SIGN ACCORD ON COORDINATING
INQUIRIES

The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms sign an agreement
to better coordinate investigations of chemical plant
explosions and to improve exchange of chemical safety data.
The memorandum of understanding lists 10 principles aimed at
improving the process under which the agencies are to notify
each other of chemical explosions at chemical plants.

Although it has no enforcement authority, the Chemical
Safety Board offers recommendations for rulemakings to the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and other state and federal
agencies.  ATF, a division of the Treasury Department,
enforces criminal law related to arson and explosives.

Under the agreement, both the chemical board and ATF will
rely on sources such as the National Response Center, a
federal operation open 24 hours a day, for initial
notification of chemical releases. The board also will
notify the ATF Enforcement Operation Center, based in
Washington, D.C., when it begins an investigation of a
chemical accident. The agreement is designed to prevent
duplicative investigations and minimize disputes over
jurisdiction in investigations. . . . Page A-7

U.S. WORK-RELATED DEATHS DECREASED 2 PERCENT IN 2000, BLS
SAYS

Fatal injuries in U.S. workplaces dropped by 2 percent from
1999 to 2000, falling from 6,023 to 5,915, according to data
released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number of
deaths in 2000 is the lowest total since BLS began counting
workplace deaths nearly a decade ago.

Although the workplace fatality rate declined for most
demographic groups, it increased among Hispanic workers last
year. The figures raise concerns about training and
compliance programs, according to top officials at the Labor
Department and the AFL-CIO. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

D.C. CIRCUIT AGREES WITH NLRB THAT PACIFIC BELL ILLEGALLY
REFUSED TO BARGAIN

Pacific Bell committed unfair labor practices by refusing to
bargain with and provide relevant information to the
Telecommunications International Union, which was in the
process, later aborted, of merging with the Communications
Workers of America, a federal appeals court rules ("Pacific
Bell v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1039, 8/10/01). The
District of Columbia Circuit finds substantial evidence
supports the National Labor Relations Board's determination
that Pacific Bell did not have a good-faith, reasonable
doubt regarding TIU's authority to represent a unit of the
company's service representatives in northern California.

Rejecting Pacific Bell's argument that it was
"understandably uncertain" as to which union was the
bargaining representative, Judge Garland finds the
memorandum of understanding between the two unions clearly
stated that TIU was solely responsible for representing the
workers at the time the company refused to bargain. Garland
also rejects the company's contention that there was a
dispute between the two unions as to which had authority to
bargain for the unit. . . . Page A-6

UAW FILES NLRB PETITION FOR ELECTION AMONG 4,100 NISSAN
WORKERS

The United Auto Workers files a petition with the National
Labor Relations Board seeking an election among some 4,100
production and maintenance employees at a Nissan Motor
Manufacturing Corp. plant in Smyrna, Tenn. If the board can
get an agreement between the company and the union, an
election could be held in approximately 42 days, an NLRB
official says. If a hearing is necessary, an election could
be scheduled within 50 or 60 days of the petition's filing.

This is the fourth attempt by UAW to organize the Nissan
employees in Smyrna since production began at the plant in
1983. In 1989, the union lost an election by a vote of 1,622
to 711. In both 1997 and 2000 the union walked away from
active organizing campaigns, according to Nissan. . . . Page

WTI PROJECTS MODEST PAY GAINS IN WEAK LABOR MARKET

Reflecting sluggish demand for labor as the economic
slowdown persists, the Wage Trend Indicator points toward
modest private industry wage increases at least through the
end of this year, according to the latest WTI figures
released by BNA.

The WTI's preliminary reading for third-quarter 2001 is
100.47, down slightly from 100.50 in the second quarter and
100.71 in the first quarter (second-quarter 1976=100). "The
WTI is suggesting that wage inflation will remain just below
4 percent over the next few months," says economist Joel
Popkin, whose consulting firm developed the quarterly
measure for BNA. . . . Page D-1

LABOR SOLICITOR REJECTS ALJ USE OF SUBPOENAS IN
WHISTLEBLOWER CASE

In an effort to adopt a uniform approach to the use of
subpoenas in administrative litigation, the acting solicitor
of labor rejects an internal holding that administrative law
judges may issue subpoenas in whistleblower cases brought
under the Energy Reorganization Act. In a staff policy
directive, Howard Radzely, acting solicitor of labor,
disagrees with a decision of the Labor Department's
Administrative Review Board holding that administrative law
judges have subpoena power under the ERA's whistleblower
provision. The board, he says, ""in dictum, "reached the
novel conclusion that administrative law judges possess the
authority to issue subpoenas under" the ERA "despite the
absence of any clear indication that Congress authorized
their use in whistleblower proceedings."

A review by the solicitor's Fair Labor Standards Division
determined that the board's conclusion "is at odds with the
principle that agencies possess subpoena authority only upon
a clear grant of such authority by Congress," the directive
says. "Because the board's reasoning is erroneous," the
Labor Department should not rely on its ""dictum" in
requesting subpoenas or responding to subpoenas in
litigation before the department's adjudicative agencies,"
the directive says. . . . Page A-1

USE OF RACIAL SLUR DURING ELECTION DID NOT TAINT OUTCOME,
COURT AFFIRMS

An employee's use of a racial slur while waiting in line to
vote in a representation election did not taint the
election's outcome, the Sixth Circuit affirms, enforcing an
order by the National Labor Relations Board requiring a
Cleveland foundry to bargain with the United Auto Workers
("NLRB v. Foundry Div. of Alcon Ind. Inc., "6th Cir., No.
00-5062, 8/9/01).

The use of the slur in this case did not constitute an
appeal by UAW or by Foundry Division of Alcon Industries
Inc. to the racial prejudices of the employees, Judge Jones
finds, ruling that the employer violated the National Labor
Relations Act by refusing to bargain. . . . Page A-1

   nonunion contractors working under the agreement to bring

HIGHLIGHTS

COURT OKS SIX-MONTH LIMIT ON SUITS, REJECTS 10-DAY NOTICE
REQUIREMENT

A provision in an employment contract between a life
insurance company and its agents stating that the agents
would have only six months to bring any claims against the
employer after they left the company was enforceable under
California law, the Ninth Circuit rules, affirming summary
judgment for the employer on the claim ("Soltani v. Western
& Southern Life Ins. Co.,"9th Cir.,  No. 99-56612,  8/6/01).

However, Judge King finds unenforceable a second provision
requiring employees to give Western & Southern Life
Insurance Co. 10 days' written notice before filing a
lawsuit. Finding no valid justification for the provision,
the court strikes it down, finding it unconscionably
deprives employees of a judicial forum.  . . . Page AA-1

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT SPLITS ON VIEW OF FLSA EXEMPTION FOR
COMMISSION PLAN

A painter working for an automobile repair shop may be
entitled to overtime even though he was compensated under a
commission payment plan that is exempt from the requirements
of the Fair Labor Standards Act, a divided Eleventh Circuit
rules ("Klinedinst v. Swift Investments Inc., "11th Cir.,
No. 99-08913-CV-SH, 8/7/01). While agreeing that the
painter's wages constituted commissions, the court remands
the case for a determination of whether his regular rate of
pay was high enough for the FLSA exemption to apply.

Calling the majority's definition of commissions
"expansive," the dissent says there is "considerable doubt"
as to whether Congress intended to shield payment plans such
as the one at issue in this case from the FLSA's
requirements. It argues that the painter was not paid on a
commission basis simply because his compensation was linked
to the amount of time allotted to the job in an automobile
repair estimate. "By any ordinary understanding of the
meaning of commissions," the payments to the painter are not
commissions, the dissenting judge says. The painter "does
not generate sales or jobs for his employer," but rather is
"an ordinary wage-earning employee performing service work
in an automobile garage." . . . Page A-8

 PARTICIPANT HAS STANDING TO CHALLENGE PENSION PLAN
AMENDMENT

A participant in a collectively bargained pension plan has
constitutional standing to sue the plan's administrator
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for
unilaterally amending the plan to grant the administrator
full discretion in determining benefits eligibility, the
Seventh Circuit rules ("Johnson v. Allsteel Inc., "7th Cir.,
No. 00-1504, 8/7/01).

Reversing a lower court's ruling that Charles Johnson did
not have standing to sue Allsteel Inc. for modifying the
pension plan, the Seventh Circuit finds that Johnson
experienced an "injury-in-fact" even though the plan
administrator had not yet adversely exercised its discretion
against him. The plan amendment adversely impacted Johnson
because it decreased his rights under the plan, the court
said.

 "By adding language that granted itself discretionary
authority to determine eligibility under and to construe the
Plan, Allsteel increased the likelihood that Johnson will,
at some point, be denied benefits under the Plan.  This
correspondingly decreased the certainty of his Plan
entitlements, causing him immediate injury, the court
explains. . . . Page A-2

STEEP ENERGY PRICE DROP PUSHES DOWN PPI

Steeply declining energy prices largely were responsible for
a 0.9 percent drop in producer prices for finished goods in
July, according to figures released by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics. It was the largest monthly decline in the
finished goods PPI since August 1993, when the index fell by
1.0 percent.

Finished energy goods prices fell 5.8 percent in July, the
biggest drop since August 1989 when they dropped 7.8
percent. The lack of inflation pressures--apparent in both
the latest PPI data and consumer price figures through
June--takes pressure off the Federal Reserve as its
policymakers approach an Aug. 21 meeting where they must
decide whether to lower interest rates  again. . . . Page

FEMALE TRAINER BARRED FROM MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM CAN GO TO
TRIAL

A female head athletic trainer who was told she could not
work with the George Washington University men's basketball
team because "it was a gender issue" should be allowed to
take her employment discrimination claims to trial, a
District of Columbia trial court rules ("Jenkins v. George
Washington Univ., "D.C. Super. Ct., No. 00 ca 3755, 8/3/01).
Rejecting the university's motion for summary judgment,
Judge Zeldon of the District of Columbia Superior Court
finds that Jacquelin Jenkins has sufficient evidence to make
out a gender discrimination claim under the District of
Columbia Human Rights Act, as well as a constructive
discharge claim. The court finds Jenkins "presented direct
evidence of gender discrimination by citing to the alleged
statements" by the athletic director. It leaves for a jury
to decide, however, whether Jenkins experienced an adverse
action. . . . Page A-2

AIRLINE ILLEGALLY CONSIDERED FMLA LEAVE IN FIRING, NINTH
CIRCUIT SAYS

An airline that fired a passenger service representative
based in part on the 16 sick days she took during the early
months of 1996 violated the Family and Medical Leave Act by
impermissibly considering FMLA-protected leave in making the
termination decision,  the Ninth Circuit rules ("Bachelder
v. America West Airlines Inc.,  "9th Cir.,  No. 99-17458,
8/8/01).

Reversing summary judgment for America West Airlines and
ordering summary judgment to plaintiff Penny Bachelder, the
Ninth Circuit rules that the airline failed to inform its
staff of the method it used to calculate the 12-month period
in which employees are entitled to take 12 weeks of FMLA
leave. Where an employer fails to notify employees of its
method for calculating leave eligibility, the method that is
most beneficial to the plaintiff should be used, Judge
Berzon writes. Applying a "calendar method," the court
determines that the leave that Bachelder took in 1996 was
protected under the act. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-11

RNS' REFUSAL TO VOLUNTEER FOR OVERTIME REQUIRED NOTICE, NLRB
SAYS

The New York State Nurses Association violated the National
Labor Relations Act by failing to issue a 10-day strike
notice when it directed its members to refuse to volunteer
for overtime at Mount Sinai Hospital, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("New York State
Nurses Ass'n, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 103, 7/27/01 [released
8/1/01]).

Overturning a decision by an administrative law judge, the
majority finds that nurses who refused to volunteer for
overtime work at the union's request and those who refused
assigned overtime were engaged in a concerted refusal to
work. The majority makes it clear that it is not suggesting
that employees could not concertedly refuse to work
voluntary overtime. Rather, it says, such a refusal must be
preceded by the issuance of a 10-day notice if a union is
responsible for the action. . . . Page A-1,  Text E-1

FOUR CURRENT NLRB MEMBERS DISCUSS MAJOR RULINGS, JUDICIAL
CRITICISM

The four current members of the National Labor Relations
Board discuss their views on past and future issues before
the board, criticism by the appeals courts, and the board
during the Clinton era during a session at the American Bar
Association's annual meeting.

The board's decisions in "M.B. Sturgis Inc." and "Jeffboat
Division, American Commercial Marine Service Co., "
involving temporary workers give rise to complicated
bargaining situations, "but I think collective bargaining is
vibrant enough, if done in good faith, to achieve results,"
NLRB Chairman Hurtgen says. Part of the difficulty in
situations involving temporary workers is created by the
unions and employers themselves trying to decide whether
including or excluding temps is to their side's advantage,
he adds.

 Hurtgen says the board's unanimous ruling in "Lee Lumber
and Bldg. Material Corp." "reflects a good result of board
decisionmaking" in which the board tried to fashion "an
easy-to-use rule" in an area that involves "unstable,
difficult factual analysis." He speculates that future
boards may fashion similar rules in other situations where
good faith bargaining is ordered.

When asked about a spate of recent D.C. Circuit decisions
that have been rather critical of the board's
decisionmaking, Member Liebman observes that any board
member needs to develop either a thick skin or a sense of
humor. "I'm concerned by the disdain and contempt for board
decisionmaking" shown in certain appeals court rulings,
Liebman adds. . . . Page C-1

NMB DISMISSES AMFA PETITION FOR UNITED MECHANICS

The National Mediation Board dismisses a petition from the
Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, an independent
union seeking to replace the International Association of
Machinists as the bargaining agent for more than 15,000
United Airlines mechanics and related employees.

AMFA's petition for a representation election was dismissed
"due to an insufficient showing of interest" among the UAL
employees to support the independent union, the NMB says.
Action on the AMFA petition opens the way for resumption of
contract talks between United and IAM District 141-M for the
mechanics group. . . . Page A-9,  Text E-19

POWELL UPDATES U.S.-MEXICAN GROUP'S IMMIGRATION DISCUSSIONS

Secretary of State Powell says that the U.S.-Mexican working
group studying immigration issues has begun exploring "some
specifics with respect to a temporary guestworker program,"
but that it is "in no hurry" to issue recommendations on the
matter. Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Mexican
officials at the State Department, Powell stresses that
establishment of a new temporary worker program has to be
"done in a careful way, a way that will be seen as fair and
equitable by ... the people of both nations."

The group is looking to fashion a system that "is grounded
in reality and the needs of our economy, one that doesn't
hurt U.S. workers," he says. The program "will rest on a
carefully worked-out partnership between the sending and
receiving countries, one that recognizes also the
contributions that undocumented Mexicans are making in the
United States and that brings together willing" workers and
employers.

 A new guestworker program is one of a number of immigration
reforms U.S. and Mexican officials have been discussing
since President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox
agreed last February to establish the working group. . . .

STAGE SET FOR CONFEREES TO ADDRESS PATIENTS' RIGHTS
LEGISLATION

When Congress returns in September from a month-long recess,
the ongoing fights over how to craft provisions expanding
patients' access to legal remedies will continue, but the
battleground will shift to a conference committee of House
and Senate representatives.

Predictions vary on what the outcome of a House-Senate
managed care conference will be. The Senate-passed
legislation (S. 1052) provides far more latitude for
patients to sue their health plans than that afforded in the
House bill (H.R. 2563), which passed with the approval of
the Bush administration. Bush has said he would veto the
Senate-passed bill. . . . Page B-1

EEOC REVOKES POSITION ON RETIREE HEALTH PLANS, MEDICARE

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission revokes its
position that employee benefit plans that either end or are
reduced when a retiree becomes eligible for Medicare violate
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

In a unanimous vote, the commission decides to rescind and
review its previous policy as set forth in its internal
compliance manual. The change means that the commission will
no longer litigate such so-called "Medicare bridge" cases
while it is reviewing the policy.

The commission "recognized the reality" that the previous
policy could have the practical effect of discouraging
employers from providing health care benefits for retirees
before they become eligible for Medicare, an EEOC spokesman
explains. An internal commission task force is currently
studying the issue and getting input from employers,
insurers, advocacy groups, and other stakeholders to examine
the issue further. The previous policy had been in effect
since October 2000. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

FIFTH CIRCUIT AGREES WITH NLRB THAT TEXAS FIRM COMMITTED
MANY ULPS

Plastics manufacturer Poly-America Inc. committed numerous
unfair labor practices relating to a 1996 work stoppage at
its plant in Grand Prairie, Texas, the Fifth Circuit rules,
upholding most of a National Labor Relations Board decision
("Poly-America Inc. v. NLRB, "5th Cir., No. 00-60013,
8/9/01).

The appeals court says substantial evidence supports the
board's findings that the company violated the National
Labor Relations Act by establishing and enforcing an overly
broad solicitation/distribution rule, threatening workers
with loss of wages and other detriments if they chose union
representation, interrogating workers about their union
activities, videotaping workers' union activities,
destroying union materials, and firing workers for engaging
in a work stoppage. The appeals court enforces the board's
order that Poly-America reinstate with back pay 19 workers
who participated in a work stoppage that began as an
economic strike and later turned into an
unfair-labor-practice strike. The company also must give
back pay to two workers suspended for insubordination after
refusing to stop distributing union material in the company
parking lot. . . . Page A-2 , Text E-2

VERIZON AND CWA AGREE ON TENTATIVE ACCORD FOR 4,200 TEXAS
WORKERS

Verizon Communications and CWA reach a tentative agreement
on new three-year contracts for some 4,200 employees across
Texas.  The proposed settlement calls for annual wage
increases totaling 12 percent, upgrades for employees in
certain smaller communities, benefit improvements, and
continuation of a team performance award plan. The proposed
agreement would apply to some 4,000 employees, primarily
technicians and customer service representatives, throughout
the state.  A separate proposed agreement, covering about
200 employees at Verizon Logistics (formerly GTE)--a unit
that provides material handling, storage, and administrative
services--mirrors the larger contract.

The settlement also calls for annual increases of 6 percent,
or a total of 18 percent, for 1,400 employees working in
smaller communities to bring their pay scale in line with
the wages in more urban areas.  In the second year of the
contract, residential and customer service representatives
who work at large call centers in north Texas would receive
an additional 4 percent increase as an upgrade. Employees
also can earn bonuses of up to 4 percent of their base pay
under the team performance award plan, if their team meets
goals established by the business unit.  . . . Page A-1

HARASSMENT POLICY NO DEFENSE TO ULP CHARGE AGAINST DIESEL
ENGINE MAKER

A North Carolina diesel engine manufacturer's investigation
of allegations that two workers "talked up" the union to
co-workers who felt harassed by the conversation, and the
company's decision to document the harassment charges, was a
violation of the employees' right to organize under the
National Labor Relations Act, the Fourth Circuit rules
("Consolidated Diesel Co. v. NLRB, "4th Cir., No. 00-2545,
8/15/01).

Pointing out that the pro-union workers were not abusive or
threatening in discussing the pros and cons of unionization,
Judge Wilkinson affirms the National Labor Relations Board's
order against Consolidated Diesel Co. It was no defense to
the unfair labor practice charge that the company had an
antiharassment policy prohibiting any unwelcome action
interpreted by the recipient or a third party as harassment.
"There would be nothing left of Section  7 rights if every
time employees exercised them in a way that was somehow
offensive to someone, they were subject to coercive
proceedings with the potential for expulsion," the court
writes, adding that "Section 7 rights are not that
vulnerable to the heckler's veto."  . . . Page A-1

IRON WORKERS IN ST. LOUIS APPROVE THREE-YEAR ACCORD WITH
CONTRACTORS

Negotiators for Bridge, Structural, and Ornamental Iron
Workers Local 396 in St. Louis approve a new three-year
agreement with the Associated General Contractors and the
Erectors and Riggers Association that increases wage and
benefit payments by $4.50 per hour for about 1,500
union-represented iron workers.

The union's bargaining committee was authorized to ratify
the contract, which calls for wage and benefit increases of
$1.55 per hour in the first year, followed by increases of
$1.50 in the second year, and $1.45 in the third year. A new
program will provide a $100 payment to any journeyman who
completes 10 hours of training to upgrade skills during
nonwork hours.  . . . Page A-8

SUPREME COURT ASKS SOLICITOR GENERAL TO FILE BRIEF ON ADA
'DIRECT THREAT'

The U.S. Supreme Court invites the solicitor general to
express the view of the Bush administration on the scope of
the "direct threat" defense available to employers under the
Americans with Disabilities Act ("Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.
Echazabal, "U.S., No. 00-1406, "interim order" 6/18/01).
Chevron U.S.A. Inc. is seeking Supreme Court review of the
Ninth Circuit's 2-1 decision last October that employers
cannot exclude workers who do not pose a threat to the
health or safety of others in the workplace but may pose a
threat to their own health or safety. The three-judge panel
initially issued a unanimous decision in May 2000, but Judge
Trott later switched sides, and the court issued an amended
decision adding his dissent.

The appeals court reversed the summary judgment granted to
Chevron by a federal district court and allowed Mario
Echazabal, an oil refinery worker with hepatitis C, to
proceed with his ADA suit. The appeals court majority
rejected an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
interpretive regulation stating that employers may assert a
direct threat defense regarding employees who pose a threat
only to their own health or safety, as well as those who
pose a threat to the health or safety of others. The Supreme
Court's action in requesting the federal government's view
indicates an interest in granting review of this case or
another case raising the same issue. . . . Page AA-1

HIGH COURT DECLINES TO RULE ON 'PEEK AT THE MERITS' STANDARD
OF REVIEW

The U.S. Supreme Court refuses to take up a West Coast
regional airline's appeal of a circuit court's decision to
only "peek at the merits" of the National Mediation Board's
decision that the airline interfered in a representation
election ("Horizon Air Industries Inc. v. NMB,  "U.S.,  No.
00-1297,  "cert. denied", 6/18/01).

The Ninth Circuit in a November 2000 opinion observed that
federal court jurisdiction under the Railway Labor Act over
NMB actions is "extraordinarily limited." The court adopted
a "peek at the merits" standard of review and affirmed that
the NMB did not act outside its statutory authority in
finding that Horizon Air Industries Inc. interfered in an
election involving the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters. The court also affirmed the NMB's order that the
employer post workplace notices explaining that a rerun
election was necessary due to the interference.  . . . Page

BUSINESSES, LABOR SQUARE OFF OVER CONTRACTOR RESPONSIBILITY
RULES

Federal contractors square off against labor, civil rights,
and environmental groups regarding controversial contractor
responsibility rules that were suspended by the Bush
administration in April. The FAR Council is accepting
written comments until July 6 on a proposal to repeal the
regulation.

Speaking at an open hearing before the Federal Acquisition
Regulatory Council, representatives of contractors tell
council members that the Clinton administration's contractor
responsibility final rules are vague and unworkable and
would require contracting officers to make "unilateral
decisions" about a company's compliance with a wide range of
laws without clarifying how those laws relate to the
contract.

Supporters of the rules, on the other hand, tell the Far
Council that the rules are a logical extension of current
procurement law, clarifying the already vague requirement
that the federal government contract with businesses that
have "integrity and business ethics."  Labor and civil
rights groups also plan to run print advertisements in
several major newspapers this week calling for Bush to lift
the stay on the rule. . . . Page A-8

D.C. CIRCUIT DIRECTS NLRB TO EXPLAIN WHY NEW ELECTION NOT
REQUIRED

The National Labor Relations Board did not adequately
explain why union supporters' threatening conduct during an
election campaign did not require overturning a
representation election won by the union, the District of
Columbia Circuit rules ("Randell Warehouse of Ariz. Inc. v.
NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1155, 6/12/01). The board certified
Sheet Metal Workers Local 359 to represent employees of
Randell Warehouse of Arizona Inc., ruling in a 4-1 decision
that photographing employees while distributing union
literature, without making any express or implied threats,
was not objectionable conduct.

The board overruled its 1988 decision in "Pepsi-Cola
Bottling Co. of Los Angeles", which held that a union
representative photographing employees, without giving an
explanation or justification, while the employees engage in
protected activity violates the National Labor Relations
Act. But the board declined to overrule its 1989 ruling in
"Mike Yurosek & Son Inc.", which ordered a new election
because a union representative threatened an anti-union
employee in connection with photographing employees'
campaign activity.

 Citing "at least three separate instances of potentially
threatening conduct" by union supporters, none of which was
connected directly to the photography, the appeals court
concludes the board should have considered the applicability
of "Mike Yurosek". . . . Page A-10,  Text E-4

AIRLINE EMPLOYEE'S CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME RULED NOT
PROTECTED DISABILITY

An American Airlines gate attendant with carpal tunnel
syndrome was not a disabled individual under the Americans
with Disabilities Act, the First Circuit rules
("Gelabert-Ladenheim v. American Airlines Inc., "1st Cir.,
No. 99-2324, 6/13/01).

The appeals court finds that since Lisa Gelabert-Ladenheim's
condition did not substantially limit her in the major life
activity of working and she was qualified for a broad range
of other jobs, she failed to meet the act's definition of
disabled.

"There is no question that carpal tunnel syndrome is a
physical impairment that has affected Gelabert's life," the
appeals court acknowledges, but its impact on her ability to
work was not substantial. "Gelabert's educational
background, skills, abilities, and work experience have
proven and continue to prove attractive to various
employers, her CTS notwithstanding," the First Circuit
holds, in affirming the judgment of a lower court. . . .

NLRB AGAIN RULES AGAINST LEE LUMBER BUT DECLINES BARGAINING
ORDER

Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp. illegally withdrew
recognition of an incumbent union before a reasonable time
for bargaining had passed, the National Labor Relations
Board rules in its third decision in the longrunning case,
but this time the board declines to impose an affirmative
bargaining order ("Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp.,
"334 N.L.R.B. No. 62, 6/28/01). On remand from the D.C.
Circuit, the board decides 4-0 "that when an employer has
unlawfully refused to recognize or bargain with an incumbent
union, a reasonable time for bargaining before the union's
majority status can be challenged will be no less than six
months, but no more than one year."

The board says the length of time that would be reasonable
depends on an analysis of several factors--whether the
parties are bargaining for an initial agreement, the
complexity of the issues being negotiated and the parties'
bargaining procedures, the amount of time spent bargaining
and the number of bargaining sessions, the amount of
progress made in negotiations and how near the parties are
to agreement, and the presence or absence of a bargaining
impasse. Applying these factors, the board decides Lee
Lumber did not bargain for a reasonable time before
withdrawing recognition from United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners Local 1027. . . . Page AA-1,  Text

FULL SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS BARGAINING PACT IRRELEVANT TO
LIABILITY

The full Seventh Circuit rules 6-3 to affirm a district
court's decision that evidence regarding an employer's
duties under a collective bargaining agreement was
inadmissible to prove that the company reacted reasonably in
failing to respond promptly to the misdeeds of a "serial
harasser" ("EEOC v. Indiana Bell Tel. Co. Inc. d/b/a
Ameritech Indiana,  "7th Cir. (en banc), No. 99-1155,
6/27/01).

Judge Easterbrook, in a portion of the ruling joined by four
of the judges, rejects Ameritech Indiana's argument that the
evidence is relevant to the issue of liability in sexual
harassment cases brought under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and affirms $15,000 in compensatory damages to
three female Ameritech workers. However on a second issue,
Easterbrook, joined by a different line up of five judges,
reverses a $635,000 award in punitive damages against
Ameritech, finding that evidence regarding arbitration and
the collective bargaining agreement was admissible as to the
issue of punitive damages.

Judge Flaum dissents in part, criticizing the majority's
"sweeping dictate" that bargaining agreements are
inadmissible in Title VII cases on the issue of liability.
Judge Rovner dissents on the issue of punitive damages,
arguing that the trial court's refusal to admit the evidence
was harmless  error.  . . . Page A-10,  Text E-7

 JUSTICES WILL REVIEW ERISA PREEMPTION OF EXTERNAL REVIEW IN
HEALTH CARE

Amid heated debate in Congress over a patients' bill of
rights, the Supreme Court decides to rule next term on
whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act preempts
statutes adopted in at least 37 states requiring external,
independent review of managed care organizations' medical
necessity decisions ("Rush Prudential HMO Inc. v. Moran,
"U.S., No. 00-1021, "cert. granted" 6/29/01).

The high court will review whether Illinois' external review
law is preempted by ERISA or whether it is "saved" from
ERISA preemption because it regulates insurance, an area
traditionally reserved for the states. The case arose after
Eileen Moran tried to recover $94,841 in surgical costs she
had paid after they were denied by Rush Prudential.

In adding the dispute to its 2001-2002 docket, the Supreme
Court opts to rule in a case the Justice Department, in an
amicus brief, had urged the justices not to accept, on
grounds that external review currently is being debated in
Congress.  . . . Page B-1

BNA SURVEY NETS PREDICTIONS OF MODEST ECONOMIC REBOUND

The sharp downturn in the nation's economy during the first
half of 2001 is still not showing any signs of improvement,
yet most economists and policymakers remain confident that
growth will accelerate by the end of the year, according to
BNA's mid-year economic outlook survey.

Among the 24 economists participating in the survey, all but
one believe that growth will rebound by the end of the year
to exceed the first quarter's anemic growth rate of 1.2
percent . Prior to the fourth quarter, however, three of
those economists fully expect to see data showing that the
country had slipped into a mild recession during the second
and third quarters. . . . Page D-1

NO NEW TALKS SCHEDULED IN IBEW DISPUTE WITH CHICAGO ELECTRIC
UTILITY

Two days into a strike by Local 15 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Chicago-based Midwest
Generation Co. has "no timetable" for resuming negotiations
over a new contract covering 1,150 of the electric utility's
employees, a company spokesman says. The strike is "not
about money," he says, but rather language that the union
was attempting to insert in the contract that would restrict
the company's use of outside contractors for work beyond the
scope of normal power plant operations.

Maintaining that the company is misrepresenting its position
in the dispute, Local 15 says no contract language has been
proposed to impede or limit the use of outside contractors.
Midwest Generation, it insists, is refusing to bargain in
good faith. While, the company attributes the strike to a
"union failing to recognize that it no longer works in a
utility environment, but in a competitive marketplace." . .

nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises for its widespread
pattern of unfair labor practices ("Beverly Cal. Corp. v.
NLRB, "U.S., No. 00-1563, "cert. denied" 6/29/01). The
Supreme Court denies Beverly's request for review of a
Seventh Circuit ruling substantially upholding the board
decision. The board found the company committed more than
100 unfair labor practices involving 26 nursing homes
nationwide.

The board first issued a corporatewide cease-and-desist
order against Beverly in 1993, but the Second Circuit
overturned it, finding the evidence insufficient for such a
broad remedy. However, the Seventh Circuit in 2000 found
mounting evidence that Beverly "continues to violate the law
with regularity." The board was "entitled to conclude,
especially after specific remedies in [the Second Circuit
case] did not appear to stop the efforts from the company's
central management to stop unions in any way possible, that
the time was past for piecemeal relief," the Seventh Circuit
said. . . . Page B-2,  Text E-1

SENATE AGREES TO REPEAL LIABILITY IF PATIENTS' RIGHTS BRINGS
COVERAGE LOSS

Backers of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy patients' bill of
rights legislation (S. 1052) win two battles in the Senate,
as the chamber votes down a motion to pull the bill from the
floor for scrutiny by Senate committees and an amendment to
fully exempt employers from new liability under the bill.

However, Republicans win approval of an amendment that would
repeal liability provisions in the bill if it is later found
to spur a large increase in the number of uninsured.

Under the amendment, if the Institute of Medicine were to
find that more than 1 million individuals lost their health
coverage as a result of the bill's enactment, the liability
provisions would be repealed. . . . Page AA-1

ULP FOR TASTY BAKING TO DEMOTE UNION ACTIVIST'S WIFE, COURT
AFFIRMS

Tasty Baking Co. committed an unfair labor practice when it
demoted a supervisor whose husband was a union activist and
later transferred her to the night shift, the District of
Columbia Circuit affirms ( "Tasty Baking Co. v. NLRB,  "D.C.
Cir.,  No. 00-1030,  6/22/00 ).

With this opinion, the D.C. Circuit joins the Third and
Seventh Circuits in finding that it is a violation of the
National Labor Relations Act for an employer to take action
against a supervisor in retaliation for a relative's union
activities. In addition, Judge Garland affirms that the
company committed various unfair labor practices when
supervisors threatened and disciplined the union activist,
Michael Flannery, and other employees.

The court enforces a National Labor Relations Board order
requiring the employer to reinstate Flannery's wife, Edwina
Flannery, to her supervisory position and to stop committing
the unfair labor practices. . . . Page A-2

IBT DELEGATES APPROVE CONSTITUTION CALLING FOR MEMBERS TO
ELECT OFFICERS

Delegates to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
convention approve a package of constitutional amendments,
which the union's leaders labelled a "democracy package."
Among the amendments are ones that will make permanent the
process of direct membership election of the union's top
officers.

IBT President James Hoffa had made approval of the
"one-member, one-vote" election process the capstone of his
convention agenda. Delegates approve the constitutional
amendments on a voice vote.

With minor changes, the amendments make permanent provisions
that were first added to the IBT constitution in 1991 as
part of the consent decree settling the government's civil
racketeering suit against the union. The amendments require
direct, secret ballot election of international officers by
members. They specify the direct election of international
trustees, positions that in the past were appointed. . . .

SEVENTH CIRCUIT FINDS RLA REQUIRES ARBITRATION OF DISABILITY
CLAIM

The Railway Labor Act's mandatory arbitration scheme bars a
covered employee from litigating an Americans with
Disabilities Act claim that "requires a potentially
dispositive interpretation" of a collective bargaining
agreement, the Seventh Circuit holds ("Brown v. Illinois
Central R.R. Co., "7th Cir., No. 00-2349,6/20/01).

 Rejecting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's
position that Congress intended the ADA to override the RLA,
the court finds that allowing Robert Brown to litigate his
disabilities claim against Illinois Central Railroad Co.
"would lead to the evisceration of the grievance and
arbitration procedures provided by the RLA." A "clearer
Congressional mandate" would be required for such a "bold
step," Judge Bauer writes for the court. . . . Page A-1

TWIN CITY NURSES RATIFY CONTRACT, ENDING STRIKE

Members of the Minnesota Nurses Association ratify a
three-year contract with Fairview Health Services, ending a
strike that began June 3 at two Minneapolis-St. Paul
hospitals. Nurses will begin returning to work at 7 a.m.
June 29.

To address workload and staffing problems, which were major
issues in the strike, the contract allows charge nurses to
temporarily close their units to admissions for up to two
hours when there are not enough nurses to provide care and
alternative resources are not available, according to Sue
Buesgens, chairperson of the MNA bargaining unit. . . . Page

MISSOURI COURT STRIKES DOWN ST. LOUIS LIVING WAGE ORDINANCE

In what may be the first judicial decision overturning a
living wage law, the Missouri Circuit Court strikes down a
living wage ordinance approved by voters in St. Louis last
year ("Missouri Hotel and Motel Ass'n v. St. Louis, "Mo.
Cir. Ct., No. 004-02638, 7/18/01). Finding that several
portions of the ordinance are illegal or "unconstitutionally
vague," Judge Dierker permanently enjoins the city from
implementing or enforcing the ordinance.

Dierker finds that the ordinance conflicts with a state
minimum wage statute by attempting to apply living wage
standards to contractors, subcontractors, and lessees of
grantholders "regardless of whether they derive any benefit
from the [C]ity" in the form of financial assistance,
regardless of whether they play a role in the economic
development contemplated by the assistance, and without
regard to time. The ordinance, approved by voters in August
2000, required city contractors, their subcontractors,
leaseholders, and companies receiving tax breaks or
assistance from the city to pay their employees a living
wage starting at $8.67 an hour with health care benefits or
$9.92 an hour without health care benefits. . . . Page AA-1,

COURT SAYS LOWER JOB RATING'S TIE TO BONUS PROVIDES BASIS
FOR BIAS SUIT

An analyst for the Department of Veterans Affairs may
proceed with her claim that the federal agency violated
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by discriminatorily
giving her an "excellent" performance rating rather than an
"outstanding" rating, which resulted in a lower bonus, the
D.C. Circuit rules ("Russell v. Principi,  "D.C. Cir.,  No.
00-5172,  7/27/01).

Reversing summary judgment for the department in the reverse
discrimination lawsuit brought by Lisa K. Russell, the court
rejects the department's argument that Russell's case was
shut down by the appeals court's 1999 ruling in "Brown v.
Brody" that poor performance evaluations were not
necessarily adverse job actions. Here, the court finds, the
performance evaluation could be considered an adverse job
action because it was directly tied to Russell's job bonus.

CHAO PROMISES REVIEW OF YOUTH OPPORTUNITY GRANTS

Labor Secretary Elaine Chao says the Labor Department will
review job training programs that are funded annually
through DOL's Youth Opportunity Grants before authorizing a
third round of funding in 2002. Speaking before the National
Urban League, Chao says that during her review she will look
for a "serious educational component to these programs, not
just dead-end diversions to make people feel better."

In June, DOL gave $202 million in youth opportunity grants
to 35 communities for job training and education programs
targeted at youths who run the greatest risk of permanent
joblessness. The grants are the second installment of a
five-year, $1.375 billion effort.

Chao also highlights a recent partnership formed in June
between DOL and the Education Department. Under a memorandum
of understanding signed by Chao and Education Secretary
Paige, DOL will take primary responsibility for the core
programs involved in the initiative--the Job Corps program
and the One-Stop Career Center system--while the Education
Department will provide guidance on adult math and reading
skills and explore high school degree options. . . . Page

AK STEEL, STEELWORKERS SET TO RESUME TALKS TO RESOLVE
TWO-YEAR DISPUTE

Although allegations of inappropriate conduct continue,
representatives of the United Steelworkers and AK Steel
agree to meet at the bargaining table Aug. 2, looking to
resolve a labor dispute at the company's Mansfield, Ohio,
plant before its second anniversary.

About 620 workers represented by USW Local 169 were locked
out of the plant Sept. 1, 1999, when the most recent
contract expired. AK Steel, which acquired the plant from
Armco later that month, has continued to operate the plant
with management employees and replacement workers.

USW representative Tony Montana says the scheduled talks
will mark the second meeting in a month. Negotiations
between the union and AK Steel resumed July 12 after a
six-month bargaining hiatus.  Neither side would comment on
the substance or tenor of their talks. Original negotiations
broke down largely over the issue of mandatory overtime,
Montana says. . . . Page A-5

PLAINTIFF AWARDED NOMINAL DAMAGES MIGHT RECEIVE ATTORNEYS'
FEES

A race discrimination plaintiff who recovered only nominal
damages of a dollar on his harassment claim may nevertheless
be entitled to attorneys' fees, provided he meets the
criteria set out in a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court opinion, the
Tenth Circuit rules ("Barber v. Williamson, " 10th Cir., No.
00-5015, 7/2/01).

A federal magistrate judge grants plaintiff Lenard Barber's
request for attorneys' fees after a jury found in Barber's
favor on his hostile environment racial harassment claim
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The jury,
however, rejected Barber's additional claims of
discriminatory termination and retaliatory discharge. It
also finds that Barber "suffered no damages" from the
racially hostile work environment, awarding $1 as a
vindication of the plaintiff's Title VII rights.

In awarding attorneys' fees to Barber, the federal
magistrate cites the "general rule" under Title VII that
attorneys' fees are to be awarded to "prevailing parties"
absent "circumstances that would make such an award unjust"
as well as Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's concurring opinion
in "Farrar v. Hobby".

On remand, the district court should reconsider its
attorneys' fee award to Barber in light of the Tenth
Circuit's clarification of the O'Connor criteria, the
magistrate concludes. . . . Page A-3

STUDY FINDS WIDE DIFFERENCES  AMONG EEOC OFFICES HANDLING
ADA CHARGES

There is an "enormous variation" in the way that the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission's 50 field offices handle
discrimination charges under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, according to a study scheduled for fall publication in
the "Kansas Law Review".

Reviewing nearly 150,000 ADA charge resolutions between 1992
and 2000, the study finds that differences among the offices
existed in every outcome measured--including overall benefit
rates and cause determinations. "It is possible that these
differences in outcomes by office reflect significant
differences in the merits of the cases brought to the
office, but it is highly unlikely that merit alone accounts
for these differences," concludes Kathryn Moss, a social
scientist at the University of North Carolina and Scott
Burris, a law professor at Temple University, and others.

An EEOC spokesman acknowledges a variation in performance,
but says the study fails to consider factors such as
controlling court rulings, the involvement of the local bar,
and the nature of the charges themselves. "If we see
something in one of the offices that is way off, it raises a
red flag on how we evaluate and review," he says. "We'd like
to do more monitoring, if we had more resources."  . . .

JOB LOSSES SLOW TO 42,000 AS FACTORY CUTS EASE

Holding out the possibility that the tide of manufacturing
losses is ebbing, the July employment report shows a much
smaller drop in nonfarm payrolls--42,000--than in June,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The jobless
rate held steady at 4.5 percent.

The latest jobs report buttressed the widely held
expectation that the second quarter will turn out to be the
weakest of the economic downturn. Pointing out that
employment is a lagging indicator, Bank One chief economist
Diane Swonk says she had expected to see "some improvement
in July, and we did in manufacturing" where the decline of
49,000 was the smallest since last December. . . . Page D-1

NLRB ISSUES REVISED CORPORATEWIDE ORDER AGAINST BEVERLY

The National Labor Relations Board, on remand by a federal
appeals court, issues a revised corporatewide
cease-and-desist order against Beverly California Corp. to
remedy numerous unfair labor practices committed at its
nursing homes ("Beverly Cal. Corp. f/k/a Beverly
Enterprises, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 79, 7/23/01).

In August 1998, the board issued the nationwide order
against Beverly to remedy the board's finding of a
widespread pattern of unfair labor practices stretching back
before 1988 and involving 240 violations at 54 facilities in
18 states.

The Seventh Circuit in September 2000 upheld most of the
board's findings and upheld its determination that a
corporatewide remedial order was appropriate. But the
appeals court returned the case to the board for preparation
of a revised order to clarify which specific directives
apply nationwide and which apply only to specific
facilities. The U.S. Supreme Court recently denied Beverly's
request for review of the appeals court ruling. . . . Page

COURT FINDS NO FMLA VIOLATION IN FIRING DIRECTOR RETURNING
FROM LEAVE

A Wisconsin nursing home did not violate the Family and
Medical Leave Act by refusing to reinstate its activities
director after she took maternity leave,  the Seventh
Circuit rules, finding the employer would have fired her
regardless of her taking leave ("Kohls v. Beverly Enter.
Wis. Inc.,  "7th Cir.,  No. 00-2064,  8/1/01).

Even though Beverly Enterprises Wisconsin, doing business as
Maple Manor Healthcare, made the decision to fire Amy Kohls
after she took the leave, Kohls was unable to rebut the
employer's evidence that she was fired for mishandling funds
and poor performance. In addition, the fact that the
employer liked the work of Kohls's temporary replacement
better than Kohls's did not demonstrate that the nursing
home violated the law, Judge Kanne finds, affirming summary
judgment for Beverly.  . . . Page A-6

SENATE CONFIRMS HENSHAW TO HEAD OSHA, DEROCCO FOR ETA

The Senate, by unanimous consent, confirms John Henshaw as
assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and
health and Emily Stover DeRocco as assistant secretary of
labor for employment and training.

Henshaw, a former corporate safety and health official with
Astaris LLC and the Monsanto Co., has called for a balanced
approach at OSHA that will provide enforcement where needed,
but also a significant focus on compliance assistance and
education.

DeRocco was formerly executive director of the National
Association of State Workforce Agencies, a trade association
representing administrators of state unemployment insurance,
employment and training services, and labor market
information programs. . . . Page A-1

Court Holds Employer Owes At-Will Employee Duty of Care in Conducting Investigation

In Texas Farm Bureau Insurance Companies v. Sears, the Waco Court of Appeals held that an employer had a duty to its at-will employee to use reasonable care in conducting an investigation into his alleged misconduct.  This case adds additional cause for concern among Texas employers dealing with allegations of employee misconduct and, in conjunction with other recent cases regarding such investigations, indicates a further erosion of the at-will employment doctrine.  The dissenting judge recognized the significant impact that this holding will have on that doctrine, titling his dissent "At-Will Employment is Dead."

PANEL WITNESSES DEBATE BILL TO ALTER WAY BONUS PAY AFFECTS
OVERTIME RATES

At a House subcommittee hearing, lawmakers and witnesses
hold fast to opposing positions on a bill (H.R. 1602) that
would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to give employers
more leeway in the way they calculate overtime pay rates for
nonexempt employees who have received performance bonuses.
Rep. Biggert (R-Ill.), vice chairman of the House Education
and the Workforce Committee's Subcommittee on Workforce
Protections, says the bill would eliminate disincentives in
current law that deter employers from offering
performance-based bonuses and "make it easier for employers
to share the wealth with their employees."

Michael Leibig, an attorney testifying on behalf of the
AFL-CIO, says the bill would give employers the authority to
legally designate as bonus pay any portion of an employee's
compensation beyond the minimum wage. While critics contend
that only "unscrupulous employers" would attempt such a
move, Leibig adds, "we should assume that all employers who
are scrupulous will answer to their stockholders. It's
something that any employer would take advantage of."

Rutgers University professor Charles Fay disagrees with
Leibig that employers could get away with a scheme to use
language in the bill to reduce employees' base wages. "Given
the language of the bill, it would be impossible," he said.
The bill includes language that requires employers to put
any incentive-based compensation plan in writing and make it
available to employees, he says, and it requires those bonus
payments to be based on a formula that is stated in the plan
and maintained in good faith. . . . Page AA-1

NLRB RULES CASINO ILLEGALLY BARRED HANDBILLING BY RESTAURANT
WORKERS

The owner of the New York New York Hotel & Casino in Las
Vegas committed unfair labor practices by prohibiting
handbilling in certain nonwork areas by off-duty employees
of restaurants located inside the casino, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in two decisions ("New York New York
Hotel LLC, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 87, 7/25/01; "New York New York
Hotel LLC, "334 N.L.R.B. No. 89, 7/25/01). Two unions were
attempting to organize employees of Ark Las Vegas Restaurant
Corp. who work in restaurants inside the casino owned by New
York New York Hotel LLC. The handbills stated Ark paid its
employees less than unionized workers and explicitly
disclaimed any dispute with the hotel-casino.

In the first decision, NLRB Chairman Hurtgen and Members
Liebman and Truesdale find the off-duty Ark employees had
the right to distribute handbills to customers in the
porte-cochere area just outside the entrance to the casino
because it is a nonwork area. In the second decision, the
board finds the hotel-casino committed an unfair labor
practice by stopping off-duty Ark employees from
distributing handbills to customers in the porte-cochere
area and in spacious passageways outside two casino
restaurants operated by Ark. . . . Page A-5

HARASSMENT STEMMED FROM UNION DISPUTE, NOT WORKER'S SEX,
COURT FINDS

A former U.S. Postal Service union steward who was harassed
by co-workers after being ousted from her union post failed
to show that the harassment was linked to her sex, the
Second Circuit rules ("Brown v. Henderson,  "2d Cir.,  No.
00-6347,  7/24/01).

Affirming summary judgment for the Postal Service on the
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act claim by Madeline E.
Brown, Judge Calabresi finds that while the harassment
included sexually charged behavior, it stemmed from a
union-related dispute, not that Brown was a woman. "Here ...
there is overwhelming evidence that the hostility toward
Brown was grounded in workplace dynamics unrelated to her
sex and that even [the obscene] pictures [posted near
Brown's desk] did not reflect an attack on Brown "as a
woman"," the court concludes. . . . Page A-7

PENNSYLVANIA LABOR LAW PROTECTS MUSHROOM WORKERS, COURT
RULES

In a ruling that removes an obstacle to organizing efforts
among Pennsylvania's 5,000 mushroom workers, the
Pennsylvania Supreme Court upholds a lower court's finding
that mushroom workers are not agricultural laborers ("Vlasic
Farms Inc. v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd., "Pa., Appeal
Dkt. 1999, 7/25/01).

The pertinent provisions of the Pennsylvania labor law were
modeled on the pre-1947 version of the NLRA, under which
mushroom workers were not considered agricultural laborers,
the court says. "The Pennsylvania General Assembly, unlike
Congress, has not acted to modify such workers' status, and
the PLRB maintains a consistent and reasonable
interpretation of the prevailing statute," the court writes.
"It is therefore appropriate for the courts to also enforce
a consistent interpretation unless and until the General
Assembly alters course." . . . Page A-2

SALES CLERK CANNOT SHOW PRETEXT IN FAILURE TO PROMOTE

An African American department store clerk, allegedly
perceived by co-workers as a "shark" who stole customers
from other clerks, failed to show that the store's reasons
for not promoting her were a pretext for race
discrimination, the Seventh Circuit rules ("Johnson v.
Nordstrom Inc., " 7th Cir.,  No. 00-3827,  7/20/01).
Although Gail Johnson claimed that her manager at Nordstrom
Inc. showed favoritism to a white employee, "simple
favoritism cannot be the basis of a race-related complaint
under Title VII," Judge Cudahy writes for the court.

"To demonstrate pretext, 'a plaintiff must show more than
that the employer's decision was incorrect; the plaintiff
must also show that the employer lied about its proffered
explanation,' " the court explains. Johnson failed to show

FULL NINTH CIRCUIT RULES PRIVACY CLAIMS NOT PREEMPTED BY
LMRA

A state law suit challenging Consolidated Freightways Inc.'s
secret surveillance of employees in the restroom of a
California trucking terminal is not preempted by the
Labor-Management Relations Act, the Ninth Circuit rules 10-1
("Cramer v. Consolidated Freightways Inc., "9th Cir. (en
banc), No. 98-55657, 6/15/01). Reversing a lower court's
dismissal of the invasion of privacy claims, the appeals
court finds the claims "are not even arguably covered by the
collective bargaining agreement" between Consolidated and
International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 63. The appeals
court clarifies the analysis that should be used in
determining whether state law claims are preempted by LMRA
Section 301, which gives federal courts jurisdiction to
decide suits alleging breach of a bargaining contract.

The appeals court ruled 9-2 that, because California
criminal law bars the use of two-way mirrors in restrooms,
employers and unions cannot bargain for contracts allowing
such illegal surveillance. Again ruling 9-2, the court
reverses dismissal of claims by approximately 274 workers of
intentional infliction of emotional distress. Judge Fisher
says because the challenged conduct violates California
criminal law, it is therefore "outrageous," a requirement
for proving intentional infliction of emotional distress. .

FIRED UNION SALTS ENTITLED TO BACK PAY, D.C. CIRCUIT AFFIRMS

Five union advocates denied jobs or discharged from
positions with an Oregon electrical contractor because of
their union activity are entitled to back pay under the
National Labor Relations Act, the District of Columbia
Circuit affirms ("Tualatin Electric Inc. v. NLRB,  "D.C.
Cir.,  No. 00-1242,  6/15/01).

Judge Ginsburg rejects Tualatin Electric Inc.'s position
that the National Labor Relations Board erred in awarding
the union "salts"--union members who apply for work at
nonunion firms in order to organize the workforce from
within--back pay and in calculating the amount of back pay
due. The board's determination was based on a reasonable
interpretation of the act, the court says, enforcing the
board's order requiring Tualatin to pay the workers $50,518
plus interest. . . . Page A-1

NUMBER OF REPRESENTATION ELECTIONS DECLINED IN 2000

The number of representation elections and the number of
eligible voters in elections won by unions decreased in 2000
from the totals in 1999, according to preliminary findings
from National Labor Relations Board data analyzed by BNA
PLUS, BNA's research division. At the same time, the union
win rate edged up somewhat.

The number of elections held in 2000 decreased to 2,849 from
3,114 in 1999, an 8.5 percent decrease. The number of
elections won by unions decreased to 1,484 in 2000 from
1,598 in 1999, but the union win rate increased to 52.1
percent from 51.3 percent one year before. The number of
decertification elections held in 2000 decreased to 357 from
387 in 1999. Unions prevailed in 31.1 percent, down from
34.9 percent in 1999. . . . Page B-1

ILO MEMBERS AGREE TO EXAMINE SOCIAL IMPACT OF GLOBALIZATION

 Members of the International Labor Organization agree to
carry out a comprehensive assessment of the social impact of
globalization, a move that is being viewed as a possible
solution to the debate within the World Trade Organization
on trade and labor standards.

Representatives from governments, employer groups, and labor
unions, meeting under the aegis of the ILO's Working Party
on the Social Dimension of Globalization, agree to carry out
what the ILO secretariat proposes to be a "major,
authoritative report that makes a comprehensive and in-depth
analysis of the social dimension of globalization,
particularly the interaction between the global economy and
the world of work."

The report, to be prepared over the next two years, under
the overall responsibility of the ILO's director-general,
would "constitute a first effort within the multilateral
system to map out all the highly complex issues involved in
achieving a more integrated approach to the social impact of
globalization," according to the ILO secretariat's proposal.

EMPLOYMENT-RELATED PROVISIONS OF NEW TAX LAW SUMMARIZED

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001, signed into law June 7, contains tax breaks for
employers offering tuition assistance and child care
facilities or referrals, as well as more than 60 items that
reform employer-sponsored pension plans. Employment
provisions of the law are examined in a report in this
issue.

Among other things, the law: permanently extends the
exclusion for employer-provided education assistance; gives
tax credits to employers that provide child care facilities
and referral services to employees; raises the dollar limit
for annual elective deferrals for Sections 401(k), 403(b)
annuities, 457, and salary-reduction simplified employee
pensions; increases the maximum annual benefit payable at
retirement for defined benefit plans; and increases the
maximum elective deferrals to SIMPLE retirement plans. . . .

BARRING CONSIDERATION OF UNION-MEMBER APPLICANTS WAS ULP,
BOARD RULES

A Buffalo, N.Y., demolition contractor committed an unfair
labor practice when it changed its hiring policy to exclude
from consideration any applicant who revealed his or her
union affiliation on a job application, the National Labor
Relations Board rules 3-0 ( "Mainline Contracting Corp.,
"333 N.L.R.B. No. 120,   8/2/01 ).

Although the three-member panel unanimously finds that
Mainline Contracting Corp. acted with an illegal
discriminatory motive when it changed its hiring policy, the
board splits on a second point. Members Liebman and
Truesdale decide that the policy would have violated the
National Labor Relations Act even if it were not
specifically aimed at keeping the union members out. The
policy "unambiguously penalizes and deters protected
concerted activity," they find. Chairman Hurtgen dissents,
disagreeing that the policy would be invalid even if it were
not discriminatorily motivated. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

APPLE WORKERS VOICE COMPLAINTS AT NAFTA FORUM

Apple workers testify about alleged violations of state and
federal wage and hour laws at a one-day public forum in
Yakima, Wash., hosted by the Labor Department's National
Administrative Office. It is the first forum on a farm
worker complaint filed under NAFTA's labor side agreement.

The forum is an outcome of a 1998 complaint filed by several
Mexican unions alleging violations of the side agreement.
Several apple workers testify about instances where they
were not paid Washington state's minimum wage and in some
cases were not paid at all for work performed. . . . Page

EEOC ANNOUNCES $3.5 MILLION SETTLEMENT IN NATIONAL ORIGIN
BIAS CASE

A former picture frame manufacturer based in Gilbert, Ariz.,
has been ordered to pay $3.5 million to settle charges that
it discriminated against its Hispanic workers based on their
national origin and sex, the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission announces. ("EEOC v. Quality Art LLC, "D. Ariz.,
No. CV-00-1171-PHX-SMM, "settlement approved" 7/31/01 ).
EEOC brought a wide-ranging suit against Quality Art LLC in
the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona,
alleging that the company's Hispanic female employees were
sexually harassed, discriminated against on the basis of
their sex, and retaliated against for opposing the unlawful
employment practices.

According to the EEOC complaint, Quality Art's Hispanic
female employees were subjected to intrusive searches, while
male and Anglo female employees were not. In addition, EEOC
claimed that Quality Art discriminated against its Hispanic
workers, most of whom were Mexican and Guatemalan, by
providing them lower wages and benefits than their
nonHispanic counterparts. EEOC also alleged that Quality Art
terminated certain employees who protested the
discriminatory employment practices and that the company
contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service in an
attempt to have the protesting employees deported. . . .

HILL WATCHERS PREDICT LITTLE ACTIVITY IN LABOR AND
EMPLOYMENT LAW ARENA

Attorneys representing unions and employers should not
expect any major labor and employment legislation to be
adopted in the coming months, Capitol Hill observers tell
participants at the annual meeting of the American Bar
Association's Section of Labor and Employment Law. Political
division is expected to hamper major legislative changes and
few labor and employment issues are capturing Congress's
attention, they say.

 Speakers add, however, that a number of side issues, such
as efforts to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act,
compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay, and privacy
in the workplace issues may arise.

"No one in the business community is talking about major
changes in the labor laws," says Randel Johnson, vice
president for labor and employment at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce. "Nevertheless, there is some interest in trying to
pursue some of the narrow issues, such as peer review on
occupational safety and health standards, comp time, and
bonus/gainsharing," he says. . . . Page C-1

NONMANUFACTURING AGREEMENTS PRODUCE WEIGHTED INCREASE OF 4.1
PERCENT

Data compiled by BNA in the first 32 weeks of 2001  show a
weighted average first-year wage increase of 4.1 percent in
newly bargained contracts in the nonmanufacturing sector
(excluding construction), up from 4 percent in 2000. The
median increase in these contracts is 4 percent, compared
with 3.5 percent last year.  Manufacturing agreements
provide a weighted average increase of 3.1 percent, compared
with 3.3 percent in 2000, and a median of 3 percent,
unchanged from the same period of 2000. Construction
contracts provide a weighted average increase of 4.4
percent, compared with 4.2 percent in 2000, and a median of
4.1 percent, compared with 4.9 percent.

Major settlements reported in the latest biweekly tabulation
include a new four-year contract covering about 1,200
workers represented by the United Steelworkers at Lone Star
Steel Co. and new three-year agreements between Safeway Inc.
and Albertson's and the United Food and Commercial Workers,
covering approximately 10,000 workers in northern
California. . . . Page D-3

SOLICITOR GENERAL SAYS DBE PROGRAM DISPUTED BY ADARAND IS
CONSTITUTIONAL

In a long-running federal contracting dispute with
implications for workplace affirmative action programs,
Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson files a brief with the
U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Department of
Transportation's "disadvantaged business enterprise" program
is constitutional ("Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Mineta,
"U.S., No. 00-730, "DOJ brief filed" 8/10/01). Olson,
appointed by President Bush, continues on the path taken by
former Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman, a Clinton
appointee, in a brief filed this past January opposing
Adarand Constructors Inc.'s petition for Supreme Court
review.

Adarand, a white-owned installer of highway guardrails
located in Colorado Springs, Colo., initially filed suit in
1989 after losing a subcontract to install guardrails for
DOT's Federal Highway Administration to a small,
minority-owned, disadvantaged business. In a landmark 1995
ruling, the Supreme Court held federal race-based measures
must meet strict scrutiny. The Tenth Circuit in September
2000 ruled the revised DBE program passed constitutional
muster even under strict scrutiny. Oral argument is
scheduled for Oct. 31. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

HONEST BELIEF OF JOB ABANDONMENT DEFENSE TO FMLA SUIT, COURT
RULES

A Denver employer can argue that it did not violate the
Family and Medical Leave Act by firing an employee who took
leave after her father had a heart attack because it had a
good faith belief that she abandoned her job, the Tenth
Circuit rules ("Medley v. Polk Co.,  "10th Cir.,  No.
00-1199,  8/9/01 ).

Reversing a $273,194 judgment for Vickie R. Medley and
remanding for a new trial, Judge Owen finds that the lower
court erred in declining Polk Company's requested jury
charge that an employer who honestly believes it is
discharging an employee for misusing FMLA leave is not
liable even if the employer is mistaken. Federal appellate
and district courts unanimously have held "that an employer
who discharges an employee honestly believing that the
employee has abandoned her job and is otherwise not using
FMLA leave ... would not be in violation of FMLA, even if
its conclusion is mistaken, since this would not be a
discriminatory firing," Owen concludes. . . . Page A-1

OPERATING ENGINEERS IN CALIFORNIA, NEVADA APPROVE NEW
CONTRACTS

Members of International Union of Operating Engineers Local
12 approve new labor agreements with several contractor
associations that provide wage and benefit increases
totaling $4.65 per hour for approximately 10,000 equipment
operators in the Los Angeles, San Diego, and Las Vegas
metropolitan areas. New in the IUOE agreements is expanded
jurisdiction for union members in a broad range of
construction inspection tasks.

Meanwhile, Laborers' International Union Local 89 in San
Diego approves a three-year, $3.40 per hour contract for
about 600 tradesmen on highway and utility projects. . . .

SEIU MEMBERS RATIFY CONTRACT WITH AMERICAN MEDICAL RESPONSE
WEST

American Medical Response West and Service Employees
International Union Local 250 agree they have a "totally
ratified" labor contract and the union withdraws a 10-day
strike notice. The five-year master agreement covers 18
different bargaining units of some 2,200 paramedics,
emergency medical technicians, dispatchers, and other
workers who provide emergency and nonemergency ambulance
service in 20 Northern California counties.

Workers voted last month on a tentative agreement that was
reached June 30. When the ballots were tallied Aug. 1,
employees in three bargaining units had rejected the pact
and the union issued a strike notice for facilities in three
counties. The company took the position that there could not
be a strike because a majority of the employees had accepted
the master agreement. The union's attorney also later took
that position. . . . Page A-2

AIDS IN THE WORKPLACE: SOME OLD PROBLEMS PERSIST, NEW ISSUES
ARISE

Recent medical advances in the treatment of AIDS and HIV
mean individuals with the disease can lead much longer,
healthier lives, and be at work and productive for a longer
time. "We're at a very dangerous stage in the epidemic, and
that's the stage of complacency,"  warns Peter Petesch,
co-chair of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's Business Responds to AIDS program.
Workplace training and education about HIV/AIDS has slipped
down the employer priority list as the disease has gotten
less and less publicity, says Petesch. People have come to
view AIDS as an illness that can be ignored, he adds.

Nancy Breuer, an HIV/AIDS workplace training specialist,
says employers make a mistake with regard to HIV-positive
employees when they "focus on their diagnosis instead of
focusing on their productivity." Victor Barnes, director of
the CDC's Business Responds to AIDS and Labor Responds to
AIDS programs, asserts that workplace HIV/AIDS policies are
crucial in addressing the main issues surrounding the
disease, including workplace accommodations,
confidentiality, benefits, discrimination and the Americans
with Disabilities Act, and co-worker concerns. "It's
critical that workplace policies are in place," he says. . .

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS SUPERVISOR DID NOT TAINT SIGNING OF
UNION CARDS

A Georgia heating and air conditioning firm's withdrawal of
its voluntary recognition of the Plumbers and Pipefitters
union was not justified by a supervisor's actions in signing
a union authorization card and speaking in favor of the
union, the Eleventh Circuit rules ("Waldinger Corp. v. NLRB,
"11th Cir., No. 00-14015, 8/24/01). The appeals court
affirms the National Labor Relations Board's 2-1 decision
that Waldinger Corp. committed an unfair labor practice by
withdrawing recognition of Local 72 and refusing to
negotiate a contract.

The board adopted an administrative law judge's findings
that the supervisor's involvement did not taint the signing
of union authorization cards by eight of 12 nonsupervisory
workers and that the branch manager voluntarily recognized
the union, requiring good-faith bargaining for a reasonable
period of time. Judge Birch finds substantial evidence
supports the board's ruling that the supervisor did not
create the impression that the company supported the union
or do anything to pressure employees to sign authorization
cards. . . . Page AA-1

ULP FOR PUBLISHER TO HIRE STRINGERS DURING BARGAINING, THIRD
CIRCUIT SAYS

A local newspaper publisher in Ellwood City, Pa., committed
an unfair labor practice when it hired "stringers"--
independent contractors who took photographs for the paper
on an ad hoc basis--to perform night and weekend photography
work when its regular, union-represented photographer became
overworked, the Third Circuit rules ("Citizens Publishing
and Printing Co. v. NLRB,  "3d Cir.,  No. 00-2825,
8/24/01).

Affirming an order from the National Labor Relations Board,
Judge Fuentes also decides that the strike that was prompted
by Citizens Publishing and Printing Co.'s decision to hire
the stringers was an unfair labor practices strike, not a
mere economic strike. The company violated the National
Labor Relations Act by falsely informing Teamsters Local 261
that it had permanently replaced the striking workers and by
not reinstating them when they made an unconditional offer
to return to work, the court holds.  . . . Page A-10

IBEW MEMBERS RATIFY CONTRACT FOR 3,000 WISCONSIN ELECTRIC
EMPLOYEES

A new three-year agreement between Wisconsin Electric Co.
and IBEW Local 2150 calls for wage increases totaling 9.35
percent over term and improvements in certain benefits. The
agreement, which applies to a wall-to-wall unit of about
3,000 employees, provides an initial general wage increase
of 3 percent, retroactive to Aug. 16, the effective date of
the new agreement. There are further increases of 3 percent
next August and 3.35 percent in August 2003.

 In addition, a cost-of-living provision in the second and
third years could give employees additional adjustments
amounting to one-half of the difference between the
negotiated increase and the inflation rate. Thus, if
inflation is 4 percent next year, an additional 0.5 percent
would be added to the 3 percent negotiated for 2002.
Employees will continue to pay 10 percent of the cost of
their health care premiums for the first two years,
increasing to 15 percent in the third year. However, the cap
on employees' out-of-pocket payments for health services
will be lifted. . . . Page A-6

TRADE-IMPACTED  COMMUNITIES FACE DIFFICULTIES, GAO FINDS

Communities that have experienced high worker dislocation
because of trade have difficulty re-employing many of those
workers because they have low education levels and limited
English proficiency, according to a recently released report
from the General Accounting Office. The problems stem in
part from confusion between two trade adjustment assistance
programs that have different requirements and an unstable
source of funding for states, according to the report. Other
inconsistencies in the Trade Adjustment Assistance program
hamper its effectiveness in re-employing dislocated workers,
the report says. For example, participants are eligible for
up to two years of occupational training, but only 18 months
of income support.

The president has been silent on TAA except to state that he
wants to propose changes to it. The administration is
expected to issue a position statement on TAA in early
September, according to a Labor Department spokesman. The
program expires Sept. 30 unless it is reauthorized by
Congress. . . . Page A-1

EPITHETS BY CO-WORKER ARE ENOUGH FOR TRIAL ON RACE
DISCRIMINATION

An African American leasing agent who was subjected to
racist epithets from a co-worker can proceed to trial with
her claims of race discrimination under Title VII of the
1964 Civil Rights Act, a federal judge in Baltimore rules
("Collier v. Ram Partners, Inc., "D. Md., 00-3294, 8/21/01).

Judge Davis of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Maryland observes that cases of hostile environment race
discrimination are rare, "[g]iven the coarseness of modern
discourse." But he finds that Rhonda Collier's claims
against RAM Partners, if viewed in a most favorable light,
were sufficiently severe to warrant a trial. Collier not
only protested against the "verbally-created racist regime,"
which she contended was tolerated by company officials, but
was subjected to serious threats of physical harm after
complaining, he finds, in denying the company's motion for
summary judgment. . . . Page A-9

OSHA TO OFFER OUTREACH ON RECORDKEEPING, VPP ASSISTANCE

The new head of the Occupational Safety and Health

regulations set to go into effect in January 2002.

OSHA Administrator John Henshaw also announces a new
agreement with an association representing work sites in the
OSHA Voluntary Protection Program. The Voluntary Protection
Program's Participants' Association and OSHA have "agreed to
reach out to companies" that were recently warned by the
agency to cut their higher-than-average injury and illness
rates. . . . Page C-1

NLRB ALJ RECOMMENDS AVONDALE REIMBURSE GOVERNMENT FOR LEGAL
FEES

Finding that Avondale Industries conducted a "pervasive
course of unlawful conduct" before and during a union
organizing drive among some 4,000 employees at its New
Orleans shipyard, a National Labor Relations Board
administrative law judge recommends that the company be
required to repay the federal government some $5.4 million
in legal fees it billed the Navy. The ALJ also recommends
that Avondale, which is now owned by Northrup Grumman, be
required to reinstate 22 employees who were illegally
terminated for their union activities ("Avondale Industries
Inc. and New Orleans Metal Trade Council, "N.L.R.B. ALJ, No.
15-CA-12639,7/6/01 [released 7/11/01])

In a 275-page decision, ALJ Philip P. McLeod further
recommends that the company be required to reimburse both
NLRB and the New Orleans Metal Trade Council for their
litigation fees, as well as the NLRB general counsel's
expenses in investigating the ULP cases. . . . Page AA-1

HOUSE HEARING EXAMINES OVERLAP IN GENETIC BIAS LEGISLATION

In the first House hearing this year on legislation that
would ban genetic discrimination in employment and health
insurance (H.R. 602), lawmakers question whether a
broad-based bill is necessary given existing federal and
state laws that address the issue.

Rep. Stearns (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer
Protections, asks sponsors of the legislation--Reps.
Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Morella (R-Md.)--whether a new law is
necessary.  He cites the 1996 Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, which prohibits private group health
insurers from setting rates or refusing coverage to
individuals based on their genetic makeup.  Saying only
people who are currently insured are covered by HIPAA,
Slaughter maintains that any congressional effort to ban
genetic discrimination should encompass both employment and
health insurance and should contain "meaningful enforcement
and remedies." . . . Page A-8

FORD ANNOUNCES CHANGE IN ANNUAL EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR
MANAGERS

Ford Motor Co. announces it is changing a controversial
annual evaluation system for its approximately 18,000
managers and supervisors that has triggered a spate of age
discrimination suits. In a memorandum explaining the change
to employees, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jacques Nasser
acknowledges that the original program had not been entirely
well received, saying the negative feedback "has centered
around what was viewed as an inflexible system by some, and
as discriminatory by a few others." But he insists the
evaluation program "has "nothing" to do with age or
diversity. It has "everything" to do with inspiring the best
performance of "everyone" on the management team."

A class action lawsuit against Ford for age discrimination
brought by about 60 managers "is proceeding full steam
ahead" despite the company's announcement that it is
changing the evaluation system at issue, class attorney
Michael Pitt says. "There are substantial economic and
noneconomic injuries to these people, ranging from $20,000
to $50,000 each, and Ford has given no indication that it
will correct these injuries," the attorney says. . . . Page

STATE'S IMMUNITY DID NOT BAR ADA SUIT, BUT WORKER COULD NOT
PROVE CASE

Even though the sovereign immunity doctrine did not block a
public employee's Americans with Disabilities Act suit
against the head of the Kansas Department of Corrections,
the plaintiff, who had multiple sclerosis, failed to
establish that he was disabled under the act, the Tenth
Circuit rules ("Frazier v. Simmons,  "10th Cir.,  No.
00-3131,  7/3/01).

A state's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to suits in
federal court that seek money damages for ADA violations
does not apply where a plaintiff seeks prospective equitable
relief from a particular state official, Judge Brorby holds,
finding that Steve E. Frazier properly alleged a claim for
injunctive relief against the secretary of the Department of
Corrections. However, Frazier failed to establish that he
was qualified for his job--a crime scene investigator--at
the time he was terminated because he could not perform
certain essential functions, the court says, affirming
summary judgment for Simmons.  . . . Page A-7,  Text E-1

CONTRACTOR BACK WAGE PAYMENTS TIED TO GOVERNMENT
REIMBURSEMENT

A government contractor who underpaid its employees due to a
misunderstanding regarding Labor Department wage
classifications need not reimburse those employees until the
contracting agency adjusts the compensation levels to
reflect those classifications, the Federal Circuit rules
("Richlin Security Service Co. v. Immigration and
Naturalization Service,"Fed. Cir., No. 00-1134, 7/2/01).
Richlin Security Service Co. is not liable for the back
wages owed to its security guards for services provided
under contracts with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service until it receives reimbursement from the agency,
according to the court.

 Overturning a decision by the Department of Transportation
Board of Contract Appeals, the court upholds an agreement
between the company and the Labor Department stipulating
that the employees would be paid the back wages owed
following reimbursement by the INS. "In view of the
DOL-Richlin agreement which assures Richlin will receive no
benefit from these payments, it was unnecessary to require
Richlin to pay the employees before INS supplied the funds
to which it was obligated," the court holds. . . . Page A-2

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT RULES ADEA PLAINTIFFS MAY NOT PLEAD
DISPARATE IMPACT

In a case of first impression, the Eleventh Circuit rules
that disparate impact claims may not be brought under the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act ("Adams v. Florida
Power Corp., " 11th Cir.,  No. 99-15306,  7/5/01). "The text
of the ADEA is sufficiently different from Title VII [of the
1964 Civil Rights Act] to raise doubts about extending the
disparate impact theory of liability to ADEA cases," Judge
Birch writes. In addition, "the history of the ADEA differs
from the legislative history of Title VII."

The Second, Eighth, and Ninth circuits allow disparate
impact claims under the ADEA, while the First, Third, Sixth,
Seventh, and Tenth do not, the court says. Finding the
reasoning of the First and Tenth Circuits persuasive, the
Eleventh Circuit affirms a ruling by the U.S. District Court
for the Middle District of Florida decertifying a class of
former Florida Power Corp. employees who alleged they were
discharged in violation of the ADEA. . . . Page A-2

SUPREME COURT LETS STAND RULING ALLOWING EPA SUITS AGAINST
STATES

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand an appeals court decision
that the 11th Amendment does not bar Equal Pay Act suits
against state employers, clearing the way for a class action
by female faculty at Illinois State University who allege
they are paid less than their male colleagues ("Illinois
State Univ. v. Varner, "U.S., No. 00-1277, "cert. denied"
6/11/01). In April 1996, a federal district court certified
a class of all female faculty members from 1982 to the
present.

This is the second time the Supreme Court has taken action
on the case. The Seventh Circuit in July 1998 affirmed a
district court ruling that the school was not immune from
suit. In January 2000, the Supreme Court vacated the appeals
court decision and remanded the case for reconsideration in
light of "Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents", which held that
the 11th Amendment barred Age Discrimination in Employment
Act suits against state employers. The Seventh Circuit in
September 2000 again ruled that Congress, in passing the
EPA, validly exercised its authority under the 14th
Amendment to abrogate state immunity under the 11th
Amendment, taking away any impediment to EPA suits against
state employers. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

COURT REVIVES ARBITER'S RULING REINSTATING SEXUAL HARASSER

An arbitrator did not violate public policy or exceed his
authority in reinstating a Texas factory worker who had been
discharged for sexually harassing female employees, the
Fifth Circuit rules ("Weber Aircraft Inc. v. General
Warehousemen and Helpers Union Local 767, "5th Cir., No.
00-40284, 6/7/01).

"The question to be answered is not whether [employee Roy]
Sewell's sexual harassment of female coworkers itself
violates public policy, but whether the [collective
bargaining agreement], which (as interpreted by the
arbitrator) for his reinstatement, does so," Judge  Dennis
writes for the Fifth Circuit, reversing a district court's
ruling that had vacated the arbitration award. Applying
Supreme Court precedent, the court finds no " 'explicit,'
'well-defined,' 'dominant' public policy to which the
arbitrator's decision 'runs contrary.' " . . . Page A-1

IBEW MEMBERS RATIFY  THREE-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH EXELON CORP.

Members of Local 15 of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers vote overwhelmingly to ratify a new
three-year pact with Exelon Corp. that will provide
employees of the Chicago-based electric utility with 3.5
percent wage increases in each year of the agreement.

The new agreement covers about 7,500 Exelon employees in
northern Illinois--nearly all of Exelon's nonsalaried
workers in the state. Covered employees include clerks,
underground technicians, repair and maintenance workers, and
technicians operating Exelon's fleet of nuclear power
plants.  Exelon, an energy generation and distribution
company, was formed last year through the merger between
Unicom Corp. and Peco Energy Inc. . . . Page A-7

EU MEMBER STATES AGREE ON MEASURE TO REQUIRE WORKER
CONSULTATIONS

European Union member states reach agreement on
controversial labor legislation that would require companies
with 50 employees or less to consult with workers before
implementing layoffs or decisions related to relocation or
other economic restructuring. The Council of Social Affairs
Ministers meeting in Luxembourg also approves legislation to
set noise limits in the workplace and require equal
treatment for male and female workers.  All three measures
must still be approved by the European Parliament, and any
differences between the two institutions must be worked out
in a conciliation committee.

 The United Kingdom and Ireland had blocked the worker
consultation legislation since it was proposed by the
European Commission in 1998.  Under an agreement proposed by
Sweden--which holds the rotating EU presidency--a seven-year
exemption for the United Kingdom and Ireland was added to
the measure. In addition, language was removed from the
proposed legislation that would have allowed member states
to financially sanction any company that violates the
legislation.  . . . Page A-1

TRAINING IN EMPLOYMENT LAW HELPS MANAGERS, PREVENTS LAWSUITS

Employment law training is being called safety training for
managers and inexpensive insurance for employers. A number
of U.S. Supreme Court decisions in recent years that allow a
company's policies and procedures to be part of a defense
against charges such as sexual harassment are leading many
companies to recognize the need for such training to prevent
situations that could lead to expensive employment lawsuits.

According to one company's training director, three Supreme
Court decisions--"Faragher v. Boca Raton, Fla." in 1998,
"Burlington Industries Inc. v. Ellerth" in 1998, and
"Kolstad v. American Dental Assoc. " in 1999--made many
companies realize the need for employment law training. They
"have made employers responsible for managers' conduct,
particularly in harassment situations," she says.

A broad spectrum of training tools is available and growing
all the time to meet employers' demands for teaching
managers and others about employment law. They include
on-site classroom training tailored by lawyers, company
policies, generic classroom training by employer
associations on specific employment law topics, e-learning
at employees' desks about aspects of a particular law,
videos, and printed materials. . . . Page C-1

FOX CALLS FOR GUESTWORKER AGREEMENT BY YEAR'S END; BUSH
HEDGES ON TIME

As the first White House official state visitor during the
Bush administration, Mexico's President Vicente Fox calls on
the United States and Mexican governments to reach an
agreement on immigration reforms by the end of the year.

White House officials say Bush shares many of Fox's
objectives, but decline to say that the administration also
has set the end of this year as a deadline for coming up
with such an agreement. As part of the immigration
discussion, the Bush administration is seeking a temporary
worker program with Mexico that is "grounded in reality and
the needs of our economy, and that doesn't hurt U.S.
workers," according to a White House statement.

The statement is silent about legalizing undocumented
workers who are currently in the United States, as proposed
by Fox and several U.S. lawmakers. Any U.S.-Mexico
guestworker program should recognize "the contributions
undocumented Mexicans are making in the United States,"
according to the White House statement. . . . Page AA-1

NLRB 2-1 REJECTS PARKING FIRM'S ATTEMPT TO BYPASS
AFTER-ACQUIRED CLAUSE

A California parking-facilities operator cannot demand a
representation election for a separate unit of employees of
a recently acquired company when a union sought inclusion of
those employees in an already existing bargaining unit
pursuant to an "after acquired" clause in a bargaining
contract, the National Labor Relations Board rules in a 2-1
decision ("Central Parking Sys. Inc., "335 N.L.R.B. No. 34,
8/27/01 [released 8/30/01]). Affirming a regional director's
dismissal of Central Parking System Inc.'s representation
petition, Members Liebman and Truesdale find that if the
company agreed to an after-acquired clause covering the
situation, it waived its right to demand an election. The
two members also find the petition must be dismissed because
International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 665 did not
seek recognition to represent a separate unit consisting
only of employees from the acquired company.

The majority defers to grievance arbitration to resolve the
remaining issues regarding the after-acquired clause.
Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen asserts the validity of the
representation petition does not turn on the basis for the
union's recognition demand. The board, not an arbitrator,
should decide representation issues and assure employees'
rights are protected, Hurtgen says. . . . Page A-1

FIRST CIRCUIT OKS $400,000 IN PUNITIVES IN MANAGER'S
RETALIATION SUIT

The First Circuit affirms a $730,000 jury verdict for a
credit union financial planning manager whose chief
executive officer undercut her authority, stripped her of
management duties, pitted her co-workers against her, and
eventually terminated her after she filed sex and pregnancy
discrimination claims against the company ("Zimmerman v.
Direct Federal Credit Union,  "1st Cir., No. 01-1007,
9/4/01).

The evidence supported the jury's $400,000 award of punitive
damages based on Celia G. Zimmerman's claim that the chief
executive officer at Direct Federal Credit Union, David
Breslin, retaliated against her in violation of
Massachusetts's anti-discrimination law. The award was fair,
given that the "jury rationally could have found that
Breslin (and through him, Direct) mounted a deliberate,
systematic campaign to punish the plaintiff as a reprisal
for her effrontery in lodging a discrimination claim," the
court rules. The court further affirms the jury's decision
that Breslin tortiously interfered with Zimmerman's
advantageous relationship with her employer. . . . Page A-5

FORMER IUE OFFICIAL MAY PROCEED WITH RETALIATION CHARGES
AGAINST UNION

A former official of the International Union of Electronic
Workers who was suspended after criticizing the union's
president may proceed with his claim that he was retaliated
against for exercising his right to free expression in
violation of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure
Act, the District of Columbia Circuit rules ("Gilvin v.
Fire, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-7221, 8/21/01). Holding that the
former secretary-treasurer of IUE was protected by the
LMRDA, the D.C. Circuit reverses a lower court decision that
the law protects only the rights of union members, not union
officers. "That holding was an error of law," the court
said.

IUE suspended Ron Gilvin for refusing to sign checks
authorized by the union's president, Edward Fire. Gilvin,
who was subsequently recalled by IUE members, maintained
that the union violated his LMRDA rights to free expression
because the suspension was imposed in retaliation for his
criticism of Fire's plan to transfer money from the union's
strike fund to a general fund. He also questioned increases
in union subsidies to its district councils, as well as
raises and travel reimbursements authorized by Fire. . . .

NONMANUFACTURING CONTRACTS IN 2001 SHOW WEIGHTED GAIN OF 3.9
PERCENT

Data compiled by BNA in the first 36 weeks of 2001 showed
that the weighted average first-year wage increase in newly
bargained contracts in the nonmanufacturing sector
(excluding construction) was 3.9 percent compared with 4
percent in 2000. The median increase in these contracts was
4 percent, compared with 3.5 percent last year.
Manufacturing agreements provided a weighted average
increase of 3.1 percent, compared with 3.3 percent in 2000,
and a median of 3 percent, unchanged from the same period in
2000.

 Among new settlements included in the latest biweekly wage
tabulation include: an agreement between the Paper,
Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers and Procter &
Gamble; and a contract between Wisconsin Electric Co. and
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers . . .

SUPREME COURT AGREES TO HEAR TWO TITLE VII CASES INVOLVING
FILING PERIODS

The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to review two cases involving
limitations periods for claims under Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act. The high court will hear a challenge to a
long-standing Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
regulation that allows an employee alleging discrimination
to verify a charge after the statutory filing deadline in
situations where the individual already filed a timely but
unsworn discrimination charge ("Edelman v. Lynchburg
College, "U.S., No. 00-1072, "cert. granted" 6/25/01).
Leonard Edelman, a former biology professor at Lynchburg
College in Virginia, sought Supreme Court review of an
October 2000 decision by the Fourth Circuit finding the EEOC
rule invalid. The circuits are split 4-2 on the issue. The
acting solicitor general filed a brief supporting the EEOC
rule.

The Supreme Court also agrees to consider whether an Amtrak
worker could invoke the continuing violations doctrine and
seek damages against his employer for five years of
allegedly discriminatory conduct, even though it would have
been reasonable for him to file charges against the company
at an earlier time ("National Railroad Passenger Corp. d/b/a
Amtrak v. Morgan,  "U.S.,  No. 00-1614,  "cert. granted,"
6/25/01). The Ninth Circuit in November 2000 ordered a new
trial on Abner Morgan's Title VII race discrimination claim,
finding that the trial court erred in ruling that incidents
that occurred more than 300 days prior to the date Morgan
filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC were
time-barred. . . . Page AA-1,  AA-2

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR FMLA CASE ON DOL'S ADVANCE NOTICE
RULES

The U.S. Supreme Court agrees to review an appeals court
decision finding invalid a Labor Department regulation
requiring employers to provide employees with advance notice
that their paid or unpaid medical leave will be counted
toward their 12 weeks of leave under the Family and Medical
Leave Act ("Ragsdale v. Wolverine Worldwide Inc., "U.S., No.
00-6029, "cert. granted" 6/25/01). Tracy Ragsdale sought
review of the Eighth Circuit's July 2000 decision dismissing
her FMLA claim against Wolverine Worldwide Inc. Ragsdale
took seven months of employer-provided medical leave while
under treatment for cancer but was not told it would count
toward her FMLA allotment. She returned to work but then was
turned down when she requested FMLA leave.

A DOL regulation provides: "In all circumstances, it is the
employer's responsibility to designate leave, paid or
unpaid, as FMLA-qualifying, and to give notice of the
designation to the employee." Another rule states that an
employee will retain the right to 12 weeks of FMLA leave if
the employer fails to provide prior notice that the leave
will be counted toward the FMLA allotment. The latter DOL
rule "creates rights which the statute clearly does not
confer," the Eighth Circuit said, agreeing with an Eleventh
Circuit decision. In contrast, the Sixth Circuit endorsed
the DOL notice rules. The acting solicitor general submitted
a brief arguing the rules are valid but asking the Supreme
Court not to take this case. . . . Page AA-3

IBEW LOCAL REACHES TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH AMERITECH

International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 21
reaches tentative agreement with Ameritech on a three-year
contract that would provide more than 12,000 employees of
the SBC Communications Inc. subsidiary with wage increases
totaling 12.25 percent over term. The bargaining team was
successful in expanding a two-year wage reopener into a
three-year agreement expiring June 26, 2004, according to
the union. Originally, negotiations were reopened to set the
terms only for wage provisions in the final two years of a
five-year contract.

The tentative agreement contains a 4.25 percent wage
increase in the contract's first year, effective June 24,
2001; a 3 percent increase effective June 23, 2002, and a 5
percent increase effective June 22, 2003. The agreement also
contains improvements to current health, medical, dental,
and vision benefits, including a new provision allowing
employees to select Blue Cross/Blue Shield's preferred
provider organization health insurance plan.

IBEW is recommending ratification of the agreement that
would cover more than 12,000 workers. The local will mail
ratification ballots to union members in mid-July and will
count them the first week in August . . . Page A-1

JUSTICES ASK ADMINISTRATION VIEW OF ERISA AND 'WILLING
PROVIDER LAWS'

The U.S. Supreme Court asks the Bush administration to weigh
in on the ability of the states to regulate managed
health-care networks, by inviting the solicitor general to
file a legal brief on whether state "any-willing-provider"
laws are superseded by the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act ("Kentucky Ass'n of Health Plans Inc. v.
Miller, "U.S., No. 00-1471, "interim order "6/25/01).

Any-willing-provider laws bar health benefit plans from
discriminating against or excluding from their networks any
health care provider located within certain geographic
bounds who is willing to abide by the terms of participation
in the plan.

The Supreme Court has been asked to review a 2-1 finding of
the Sixth Circuit that any-willing-provider laws "relate to"
health benefit plans under ERISA, but are "saved" from ERISA
preemption because they regulate insurance--an area carved
out from ERISA's preemptive sweep because the regulation of
insurance has traditionally been reserved for the states.
The Supreme Court has not yet indicated whether it will
grant or deny the petition for review. . . . Page AA-4

NO HIGH COURT REVIEW OF MAN'S CLAIMS THAT HMO LIABLE FOR
WIFE'S SUICIDE

The U.S. Supreme Court leaves intact a federal appeals
court's decision to allow a Pennsylvania man to proceed on
state tort law claims that a health maintenance organization
was liable for allegedly denying treatment requested by his
wife prior to her 1993 suicide ("Aetna U.S. Healthcare v.
Lazorko, "U.S., No. 00-1641, "cert. denied" 6/25/01). The
high court's decision not to review the case leaves
undisturbed a December 2000 ruling by the Third Circuit
addressing whether Jonathan Lazorko's tort claims against
Aetna U.S. Healthcare and other defendants were preempted by
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Aetna U.S.
Healthcare had sought high court review of the appeals court
decision, arguing that the issues raised by the case are
important and that the federal courts are divided over
whether beneficiaries have the right to bring direct
liability and vicarious liability lawsuits against managed
care organizations. . . . Page AA-4,  Text E-1

DEMOCRATS UNVEIL BROAD IMMIGRATION POLICY PRINCIPLES

House and Senate Democratic leaders unveil a broad statement
of principles on immigration policy that incorporates an
"enhanced temporary worker program" and a uniform set of
procedures for immigrants to earn United States citizenship.

At a press briefing, Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.)
says President Bush's recent focus on U.S-Mexico relations
"offers us a historic opportunity to recraft our immigration
policies in ways that are fair to America's families."
Daschle says he hopes to introduce legislation in the
current Congress that would embrace the principles, adding
that Democrats intend to work with the Bush administration
to craft such a policy. . . . Page AA-1

HARASSERS CAN BE PREDATORS OR INTERESTED MEN, COURT SAYS

A property management firm maintenance worker who delayed
reporting her supervisor's sexual advances until she could
decide whether he was a "predator" or merely an "interested
man" who could be rebuffed politely, cannot hold her
employer liable for sexual harassment, the Fourth Circuit
decides, because she failed to take advantage of the
employer's sexual harassment policy ("Matvia v. Bald Head
Island Management Inc.,  "4th Cir.,  No. 00-1650,  7/31/01).

Affirming summary judgment to Bald Head Island Management
Inc. on the sexual harassment claim brought by Christina
Matvia under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Judge
Traxler finds that Fourth Circuit case law makes no
distinction between "predators" and "interested men," so
long as their behavior is unwanted and sufficiently severe
or pervasive to alter the terms or conditions of employment.
The court also rejects Matvia's claim that her promotion,
raise, and good performance reviews in light of her "silent
suffering" of the supervisor's advances were tangible job
actions taken against her in violation of Title VII. . . .

SHAW'S CONTRACT WITH UFCW  COVERS 6,500 WORKERS IN NEW
ENGLAND

A newly ratified three-year contract between Shaw's
Supermarkets Inc. and UFCW Local 791 gives approximately
6,500 hourly employees annual wage increases and enhanced
pension benefits and maintains the current health care
coverage with an increase in the employees' premium share.
The contract covers Shaw's employees at 38 retail stores in
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. A separate but parallel
agreement, negotiated at the same time, applies to some 375
workers at the company's distribution center in Wells,
Maine.

The strike-averting settlement also includes a separate
"closing agreement" setting out the terms of the severance
package and enhanced pension benefits for some 380 employees
at a distribution center in East Bridgewater, Mass., which
the company plans to close by the end of October.  Workers

AFA TO FILE PETITION BY LABOR DAY FOR DELTA FLIGHT
ATTENDANTS

The Association of Flight Attendants is expecting to file a
petition with the National Mediation Board before Labor Day
to represent some 20,000 flight attendants at Delta
Airlines. That campaign is just one of several organizing
drives discussed during the summer meeting of the AFL-CIO
Executive Council July 31-Aug. 1.

The Delta campaign is taking place at 14 flight attendant
bases around the country. The flight attendants are the last
nonunion flight attendant workforce at any major U.S.
airline, according to the union. The flight attendants began
exploring union representation more than five years ago, and
AFA began its organizing drive at the carrier in earnest in
1998. . . . Page C-1

FIRST CIRCUIT REJECTS CLAIM FOR COGNITIVE PROBLEM DUE TO
CHEMOTHERAPY,

A secretary's cognitive impairment, caused by chemotherapy,
was "mild, reversible, and short lived," the First Circuit
rules, rejecting her discrimination claim under the
Americans with Disabilities Act against her employer
Greenberg, Rosenblatt, Kull & Bitsoli, an accounting firm
("Whitney v. Greenberg, Rosenblatt, Kull & Bitsoli, "1st
Cir., No. 00-2319,  7/27/01). "To prevail, [Ellen] Whitney
would have to establish that her cognitive impairment was
profound enough and of sufficient duration, given the nature
of her impairment, to hamper her ability to work or to
learn," Judge Coffin says. "The record supports neither
restriction."

GRK&B denied Whitney's requests to work part-time or adjust
her hours, gave her a negative job evaluation, and
restricted her duties. The next month, the firm fired her.
Less than three weeks later, she got another job at a bank
where she successfully learned a new computer system, and
then moved on to a permanent job. The court finds that she
did not request accommodations in either position and did
not inform the banks of her disability. "[T]he evidence is
that she satisfactorily completed at the two banks the same
types of administrative duties for which she had been
responsible at GRK&B." . . . Page A-2

"GARRETT" CONTROLS STATE WORKER'S SUIT CHARGING VIOLATION OF
TITLE V OF ADA

Sovereign immunity bars a former California state senate
committee staffer's federal lawsuit alleging he was fired in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act after
telling a state senator that the committee's refusal to hire
a disabled campaign worker violated federal law, the Ninth
Circuit rules ("Demshki v. Monteith,  "9th Cir.,  No.
00-15599,  7/2/01).

Reversing a trial court's refusal to throw out David
Demshki's claim against the California Senate Rules
Committee, Judge G. Silverman finds that the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent holding in "Board of Trustees of the
University of Alabama v. Garrett, " which found unconsenting
states immune from suits brought under Title I of the
ADA--prohibiting disability-based employment
discrimination--also is applicable to cases brought under
Title V of the act. Title V prohibits discrimination against
those who oppose discriminatory acts or practices made
illegal by the ADA. . . . Page AA-1

RETIREMENT PLAN WITH LOWER HEALTH BENEFITS DID NOT VIOLATE
ADEA

A voluntary retirement plan initiated as a cost-savings
measure by the University of Rhode Island did not violate
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, even though it
provided a lower health insurance stipend for participants
over the age of 65 when they became eligible for Medicare
coverage, a federal judge rules ("Gutchen v. Board of
Governors of Univ. of Rhode Island, "D.R.I., No. 99-319,
6/22/01).

"In short, the health benefit stipend component of the
voluntary retirement incentive plan complies with the ADEA,"
Judge Lagueux of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Rhode Island writes. "The ADEA ensures equal, not
preferential treatment for older employees. There is no
violation of the ADEA when the employer provides the same
level of benefits to older workers as to younger workers."

He grants summary judgment to the university and rejects the
claims of two professors, whose challenge to the plan was
supported by the AARP Foundation Litigation, the nonprofit
legal advocacy arm of AARP, the senior citizens'
organization. . . . Page A-6

BEST BUY AGREES TO PAY $5.4 MILLION TO SETTLE OVERTIME
DISPUTE

Best Buy Inc., the national chain of electronic products
stores, has agreed to pay $5.4 million to settle a dispute
regarding its payment of overtime to employees, the Labor
Department announces. The Minneapolis-based firm was charged
with not properly compensating some 70,000 current and
former workers as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
According to DOL, workers were not paid for hours worked on
their days off, time worked during meal breaks, hours worked
after they punched out on the time clock, and time they
waited for managers to unlock doors at the end of shifts.
Best Buy also did not keep an accurate record of hours
worked by employees as required by the FLSA, the Labor
Department says.

Best Buy "disputes the Labor Department's findings, but
decided to resolve the case to avoid protracted litigation,"
a company spokeswoman says. The company expects that
"qualified employees will receive a letter and checks in
approximately six to 10 weeks," she says. Best Buy has
"agreed to comply with the federal overtime pay law in the
future and cooperated fully during the investigation," says
Denise Scharlemann, director of DOL's Wage and Hour Division
in Minneapolis. The nationwide agreement covers employees of
the company's 400 stores who worked from February 1998 to
February 2000. . . . Page A-1

ASARCO, FOUR UNIONS REACH AGREEMENT TO COVER 1,450 COPPER
WORKERS

 Asarco Inc. and four unions reach a tentative agreement on
new three-year contracts to cover some 1,450 employees at
the company's Southwest copper mining and refinery
operations. Union members are voting on the proposal and a
tally of votes is expected to be completed July 5.

The proposal calls for two wage increases and some
improvements in benefits. The first increase of 50 cents per
hour would occur when the price of copper reaches $1 a pound
or on July 1, 2002, whichever occurs first. The second wage
increase, also 50 cents per hour, would become effective
July 1, 2003.  A union representative says the price of
copper is currently in the 70-cent per-pound range. The four
unions that are party to the agreement are the United
Steelworkers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the
Operating Engineers. . . . Page A-1

NO NEED FOR LAYOFF NOTICE IN WISCONSIN IF BUSINESS CONTINUES
DESPITE SALE

A company that sold its business assets to another firm that
continued operations without interruption was not required
under Wisconsin law to provide employees 60 days' advance
notice of a permanent or temporary shutdown, the state
supreme court rules (" Wisconsin v. T.J. Int'l Inc., "Wis.,
No. 99-2803, 6/28/01). Norco Windows Inc. did not violate
Wisconsin's business closing law when it sold its window
manufacturing plant to Jeld-Wen Inc., which continued to
operate the company without interruption, the court says.
The court's decision overrules the state workforce
development agency's determination that the law covered the
company's sale and that both the seller and buyer should be
penalized for failing to give advance notice to the 47 Norco
employees Jeld-Wen failed to hire.

The Wisconsin Business Closing and Mass Layoff Law's
definition of "business closing" does not include "the sale
of business assets where there is no actual operational
shutdown--permanent or temporary--of the employment site,"
the court says. "Where, as here, the transfer of ownership
continues rather than interrupts or ceases the operation of
the employment site, there is no 'business closing' under
the statute, and no 60-day notice of the sale is required,"
according to the court. . . . Page A-7

D.C. CIRCUIT DIRECTS NLRB TO RECONSIDER DECISION ON
GOOD-FAITH DOUBT

The National Labor Relations Board must reconsider whether
Willamette Industries Inc.'s objectionable conduct before a
decertification election lost by a union contaminated the
election and left the company unable to claim a good-faith
doubt that a majority of employees supported the union, the
District of Columbia Circuit rules ("Willamette Indus. Inc.
v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1366, 6/19/01). Judge Ginsburg
decides the board misapplied the good-faith doubt standard.
The board held that Willamette, by waiving its right to
appeal a hearing officer's determination that the
decertification election should have been set aside because
of the company's objectionable conduct, left the election
result tainted and therefore had no basis for a good-faith
doubt.

"Even if Willamette's waiver can be construed as an
acknowledgment that 'the results of the tally ... stood
tainted,'--a matter cast in some doubt by the
[administrative law judge's] statement that Willamette
agreed to the waiver 'in an effort to expedite a rerun
election,'--this court has clearly held that objectionable
conduct during an election campaign does not always carry
such a taint," Ginsburg says. . . . Page AA-1

SEVENTH CIRCUIT ENFORCES NLRB ORDER REQUIRING BACK PAY,
PENSION CREDITS

The Seventh Circuit enforces a National Labor Relations
Board order requiring U.S. Can Co. to pay $1.5 million in
back pay plus pension credits and other fringe benefits to
28 employees who were denied opportunities to transfer to
other plants ("United States Can Co. v. NLRB, "7th Cir., No.
99-2828, 6/19/01). In so ruling, the appeals court refuses
to give the company credit against the back-pay award for
pension benefits the employees received when they were laid
off and denied the opportunity to transfer to another plant.

The court rejects U.S. Can's contention that the 28
employees would not have transferred, even if they had been
offered the chance. "For an employee eligible to retire, the
decision to work another year at a distant plant is no
different from the decision to work another year locally,"
Judge Easterbrook writes for the court. "The employee gives
up the pension benefit that could have been received
immediately, getting in return a salary plus pension
contributions that increase the monthly benefit later.". . .

DOCTOR'S LACK OF ENTERPRISE, NOT PREGNANCY, WAS CAUSE FOR
FIRING

A Chicago pediatrician was terminated from her
hospital-subsidized position because of her lack of
enterprise, not her pregnancy, the Seventh Circuit rules,
dismissing her sex discrimination claim against her former
employer  ("Clay v. Holy Cross Hospital, "7th Cir., No.
00-2916, 6/14/01).

In affirming a lower court's summary judgment in favor of
Holy Cross Hospital, the Seventh Circuit rejects Dr. Pamela
Clay's allegation that the discharge--a week after she
formally announced her pregnancy and two months before she
gave birth--was prompted by her condition in violation of
Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Clay, who was discharged along with eight other physicians,
was terminated from a hospital-affiliated network of private
doctors because a Holy Cross vice president determined that
she "lacked the drive, work ethic, and dedication to grow
her practice into a profitable enterprise," the appeals
court says. . . . Page A-1

COURT SAYS NONWHITE WORKER CAN SUE  BASED ON ANTI-WHITE
SLURS

A Maryland state prison employee with a Filipino and Native
American ethnic background whose co-worker repeatedly called
him  "white boy" and "cracker," can sue the prison for
failing to address a racially hostile environment, the U.S.
District Court for the District of Maryland rules ("Bell v.
Md., "D. Md., No. CCB-99-451, 6/13/01).

It was irrelevant that the harasser was not "technically
accurate" in describing plaintiff Steven P. Bell's race,
Judge Blake finds, saying Bell established that the racially
hostile comments were directed at him. In addition, given
the trust needed between co-workers in a correctional
facility, Bell established that the harassment threatened
his physical safety and interfered with his job, the court
states, denying the prison's bid for summary judgment on the
hostile environment claim under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act. . . . Page A-4

OLDER WORKER NOT SIMILARLY SITUATED TO CO-WORKER WITH BETTER
REVIEWS

A 57-year-old claims handler for State Farm Mutual
Automobile Insurance Co. could not show that he was
similarly situated to a younger co-worker who received
better performance reviews, the Eighth Circuit rules,
finding Frank X. Wilcox failed to prove that the reasons for
his firing were a pretext for discrimination ("Wilcox v.
State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., " 8th Cir., No. 00-2516,
6/11/01).

Wilcox was "repeatedly admonished" for including personal
opinions in his claims files, the court says. He also was
the only person among his co-workers "who continually
received complaints from State Farm's policy-holders about
his rude and uncourteous attitude" and who showed a
persistent unwillingness to address criticisms and accept
directions, the court adds. It finds Wilcox cannot fairly
compare himself to his co-worker to raise an inference of
pretext on State Farm's part. . . . Page A-3

FAILURE TO PROVIDE CONTRACEPTIVE COVERAGE RULED SEX BIAS

In the first federal court decision on the issue, the U.S.
District Court for the Western District of Washington rules
that Bartell Drug Co. violated the sex discrimination
provisions of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by
excluding prescription contraceptive coverage from its
employee health benefit plan  ("Erickson v. Bartell Drug
Co., "W.D. Wash., No. C00-1213L, 6/12/01).

"Although the plan covers almost all drugs and devices used
by men, the exclusion of prescription contraceptives creates
a gaping hole in the coverage offered to female employees,
leaving a fundamental and immediate healthcare need
uncovered," Judge Lasnik writes, in granting summary
judgment to a class of female employees.

 "Title VII requires employers to recognize the differences
between the sexes and provide equally comprehensive
coverage, even if that means providing additional benefits
to cover women-only expenses," he holds, citing U.S. Supreme
Court rulings dating back to 1976. Bartell, a Seattle-based
chain of family-run drug stores, says its policy already has
been changed and that there was no intent to discriminate.
The National Women's Law Center hails the ruling as
"historic." . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

SEVENTH CIRCUIT RULES NLRB WAS JUSTIFIED IN DISREGARDING
SETTLEMENT

The National Labor Relations Board was justified in
disregarding a settlement agreement that nursing home
operator Beverly California Corp. reached with two illegally
fired nursing assistants and awarding higher amounts of back
pay than called for in the agreement, the Seventh Circuit
rules ("Beverly Calif. Corp. v. NLRB, "7th Cir., No.
99-4121, 6/8/01). The board ruled that Janet Glenn and Debra
Wiley, who worked at a nursing home in Kokomo, Ind., were
discharged because of their pro-union views and their
complaints about working conditions. The board later
affirmed an administrative law judge's decision to disregard
the settlement agreement, which covered race discrimination
claims and purported to settle back pay for unfair labor
practice charges filed by United Food and Commercial Workers
Local 917. The board ordered Beverly to pay Glenn $23,169
and Wiley $34,203, far more than the $4,000 and $5,000
payments called for in the settlement.

"NLRB is not statutorily obligated to honor settlement
agreements," Judge Bauer points out. He emphasizes that both
the NLRB general counsel and the union "were completely
circumvented" and opposed the settlement when they learned
of it. The appeals court also agrees with the board's
finding that the settlement amounts were unreasonable under
the circumstances. . . . Page A-7

INDEPENDENT STEEL UNION MEMBERS RATIFY CONTRACTS WITH
WEIRTON STEEL

Members of the Independent Steelworkers Union ratify three
separate 15-month contracts covering some 3,500 Weirton
Steel Corp. workers. Almost 75 percent of union members
voted in favor of the contracts, which cover the company's
3,100 hourly production and maintenance workers,
approximately 400 salaried, nonexempt workers in technical
and clerical positions, and eight nurses on the professional
staff, says Mark Glyptis, president of the union. The
contracts are retroactive to March 25 when the previous
54-month contracts expired.

 Glyptis says a reopener option included in the new
contracts is "unique" in that either side can initiate
bargaining if conditions in the steel industry improve or
worsen. Gregg Warren, Weirton's spokesman, says the
contracts do not contain any concessions, retain the
existing health package, maintain the base wage structure,
and enhance retirement formulas for those who retire while
the contracts are in effect.

John H. Walker, president of Weirton, says the contracts
provide the company "with a greater ability to restructure
in a more effective and expedient manner as the market
changes ... [and] include the option of reopening
negotiations to deal with market conditions." . . . Page A-1

SEATTLE ELECTRICIANS APPROVE THREE-YEAR CONTRACT RAISING
PAY, BENEFITS $7

Members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
Local 46 in Seattle approve a new three-year contract with
the National Electrical Contractors Association that
provides wage and benefit increases totaling $7.01 per hour
over term for about 3,000 inside wiremen in four counties in
western Washington.  Increases under the agreement take
effect every six months and will result in a total wage and
benefit package of $46.84 per hour for journeymen in the
final six months of the contract, according to data provided
by Local 46.

Barry Sherman, assistant manager of the NECA chapter in
Seattle, says the six-month splits made less impact on
current projects, but he expresses concern that the
settlement may impact long-term market share of union
contractors competing with nonunion firms. Included in the
new agreement were several language changes, including an
expansion of start-time hours. Under the expired contract,
employers could require workers to start work between 6:30
a.m. and 8 a.m. without incurring premium pay charges. Under
the new contract, employers have the option of requiring
workers to report to work as early as 6 a.m. . . . Page A-4

BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S BLUEPRINT FOR OSHA DISCUSSED AT
CONFERENCE

Labor Secretary Chao will decide within weeks the future of
Clinton administration rules governing the recording of
workplace injuries and illnesses, the acting head of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration says. Acting
Administrator Layne tells participants at the American
Society of  Safety Engineers Safety 2001 conference and
exposition in Anaheim, Calif., that Chao also has scheduled
hearings on ergonomics and will decide by September how to
proceed on the issue.

Over the next few years, a greater emphasis will be placed
on reaching out to employers, employees, academia, and
professional  associations to determine better ways to
implement job safety and health protections, Layne says.
Also at the meeting, OSHA's head of the Directorate of
Construction presents figures showing fatality rates in the
construction industry and how OSHA is seeking to reduce
those numbers. . . . Page C-1

NLRB MAY SOON EXPERIENCE MORE VACANCIES IF BUSH DOES NOT ACT

The five-member National Labor Relations Board, which has
been operating with one vacancy for almost a year, may soon
experience additional vacancies if President Bush does not
take action to keep current members in office and/or bring
in new members. The term of Peter J. Hurtgen (R), who joined
the board in November 1997 and was named chairman in May,
expires Aug. 27. He would then leave the board unless the
president nominates him for a second term or names him to a
recess appointment when Congress is not in session. Veteran
board official John C. Truesdale (D) had announced that he
will step down as a board member by Oct. 1, or earlier if
the Senate confirms a replacement or Bush wants to make a
recess appointment. After six months in office, Bush still
has not taken action to fill the vacant Republican seat and
replace Truesdale, which has allowed the board to continue
functioning with a majority of Democratic members.

Dennis P. Walsh (D), who was named to a recess appointment
by former President Clinton, will have to leave office when
Congress adjourns its 2001 session, which could occur as
early as October, unless Bush nominates him for a second
term and he is confirmed by the Senate. He cannot serve two
consecutive recess appointments. Member Wilma B. Liebman's
(D) term does not expire until Dec. 16, 2002. The fifth
board seat has been vacant since Aug. 27, 2000, when former
Member J. Robert Brame's (R) term expired. . . . Page AA-1

EMPLOYEE ARBITRATING COMMON LAW CLAIMS NOT SPARED
ARBITRATION FEES

A 1997 ruling by the D.C. Circuit exempting employees who
agree to arbitrate federal statutory claims from paying
certain arbitration fees does not extend to employees'
common law claims rooted in public policy, the D.C. Circuit
rules ("Brown v. Wheat First Securities Inc.,  "D.C. Cir.,
No. 00-7171,  7/31/01).

Judge Williams declines to extend the holding in "Cole v.
Burns International Security Services" and upholds an
arbitrator's order requiring Ronald L. Brown to pay $6,365
in arbitration costs on his claims for wrongful termination,
breach of implied contract, defamation, slander, and
tortious interference against Wheat First Securities Inc.
"In short, the proposed extension of "Cole" would
significantly alter the terms of the Federal Arbitration
Act, imposing a serious procedural limit on a wide (but
unpredictable) range of arbitration claims, all without the
slightest signal from Congress," the appeals court
concludes. . . . Page A-7

FIRING UNIONIST DAD WHO LEFT WORK EARLY WAS NOT ULP, SPLIT
NLRB SAYS

A New York automobile dealer did not violate federal labor
law by discharging a parts department employee, who was a
union member, for leaving the job early after an emergency
call from his 13-year-old son, a divided NLRB rules ("Tom
Rice Buick, Pontiac & GMC Truck Inc., "334 NLRB No. 91,
7/26/01).

Tom Rice Buick of Huntington, N.Y., "met its burden of
proving that it would have terminated [Thomas] Fell even in
the absence of his union activity, because he closed the
parts department and left work early, without notice to or
permission from management, and in spite of knowing that a
customer needed parts department services," Chairman Hurtgen
and Member Truesdale write.

Dissenting Member Liebman would have found a violation of
Section 8(a) of the National Labor Relations Act. The
discharge decision, shortly after an unlawful discussion of
Fell's union membership, amounted to "severe, "unlawfully
motivated " punishment of a man put in a tough spot, seeking
to do the right thing for his child," she observes. . . .

SENATE COMMITTEE OKS MEASURE TO RENEW, EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH
PARITY

The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee
approves a bill to extend and expand the 1996 law that
requires group health plans offering mental health benefits
to make those benefits available on a equal basis with
benefits for physical health care.

The committee votes 21-0 to approve the Mental Health
Equitable Treatment Act of 2001 (S. 543), sponsored by Sens.
Wellstone (D-Minn.) and Domenici (D-N.M.), which would
extend and expand the 1996 mental health parity law that is
set to expire Sept. 30. Although the committee vote was
unanimous, several members indicated they plan to bring
amendments when the measure moves to the Senate floor. The
committee also approves an amendment that would exempt
companies with 50 or fewer employees.

The bill would provide for full parity for all categories of
mental health conditions in the "Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth edition (DSM IV-TR)". The
1996 law, by contrast, defined mental health benefits as
those "defined under the terms of the plan or coverage." . .

PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION ORDERS CHRISTIAN COALITION NOT TO
RETALIATE

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., issues a preliminary
injunction ordering the Christian Coalition of America not
to retaliate against nine African American current and
former employees who are suing for race discrimination ("Lee
v. Christian Coalition of Am. Inc., " D.D.C.,  No. 01-0405,
7/27/01).

In what he describes as an issue of first impression, Judge
Urbina says that without the injunction, the low-paid
employees might be irreparably harmed by having to go on
welfare during the course of the litigation. "This is
precisely the type of relief that cannot be remedied at the
end of this litigation," he writes. The coalition strongly
denies the charges and has already filed an appeal in the
D.C. Circuit, according to its attorney. . . . Page A-3

D.C. CIRCUIT OVERTURNS NLRB DECISION ON WORKPLACE CONDUCT
POLICIES

A California firm's two workplace policies barring abusive
and threatening language and restricting solicitation and
distribution did not constitute unfair labor practices, the
District of Columbia Circuit rules, overturning a National
Labor Relations Board decision ("Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz
Transp. N.A. Inc. v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1282,
6/26/01). The board held the workplace conduct policies of
Adtranz ABB Daimler-Benz Transportation N.A. Inc. interfered
with employees' exercise of their rights under the National
Labor Relations Act. The board ordered that a second
election be held to determine whether Adtranz employees in
Pittsburg, Calif., wanted to be represented by the
Machinists Automotive Trade District Lodge 190 of Northern
California.

The appeals court finds it lacks jurisdiction to consider
Adtranz's appeal of the order for a new election, because it
is not a final order. The court rejects the board's view
that the ban on abusive and threatening language was an
unfair labor practice regardless of whether it actually
chilled employees' exercise of their rights. Judge Sentelle
finds the solicitation-distribution rule is legal because it
"only applies to conduct during working time and in the work
place" and "applies across the board, so it cannot be said
to discriminate against unionization efforts or other
protected activity." . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

WORKPLACE PANIC ATTACKS RENDER EMPLOYEE UNQUALIFIED UNDER
ADA

A former customer service worker for a Wisconsin power
company fired after having panic attacks at work that likely
stemmed from a head injury was unable to establish that her
discharge was illegal under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, the Seventh Circuit rules ("Emerson v. Northern States
Power Co.,  "7th Cir.,  No. 00-3746,  6/26/01).

Loretta M. Emerson failed to show she was a "qualified
individual" under the act, given that her anxiety attacks
could interfere with her ability to answer customer phone
calls about gas or electricity emergencies, Judge Bauer
finds, affirming summary judgment to Northern States Power
Co. Bauer also finds Emerson posed a direct threat to her
employer, because her job "required prompt, accurate
handling of emergencies such as gas leaks and downed power
lines that could pose significant danger to the public." . .

Association, unanimously vote to affiliate with the AFL-CIO.
If all goes as planned, the affiliation of the
100,000-member union will become effective July 1. However,
it appears one more hurdle may need to be cleared before the
affiliation, which has been in the works for more than a
year, becomes a reality.

The ANA House of Delegates is scheduled to vote June 30 on a
bylaw change that would require any state nurses'
association that engages in collective bargaining to be a
member of UAN within four years. This was a condition of the
AFL-CIO granting a charter. It is unclear whether the bylaw
change will pass, and if it does not what happens to the
affiliation agreement. . . . Page B-1

NEW YORK CITY PARTLY IMMUNE FROM BIAS LAW, COURT FINDS

In a case of first impression, a federal trial court
overturns a jury's $1 million sexual harassment punitive
damages award against New York City because it did not
explicitly waive sovereign immunity from punitive damages
under the city's human rights ordinance ("Katt v. New York
City, "S.D.N.Y., No. 95 Civ. 8283 (GEL), 6/19/01). Rejecting
the defendants' other post-verdict motions, however, Judge
Lynch of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York upholds the jury's award of $400,000 in
compensatory damages.

The court rejects the city's affirmative defense that
plaintiff Alli Katt failed to take advantage of the New York
Police Department's complaint process, finding that she was
intimidated into not doing so because of explicit and
implicit pressure. The court also rejects the city's
late-raised challenge to the timeliness of the complaint. .

HOFFA, LEEDHAM NOMINATED AS CANDIDATES FOR TEAMSTERS
PRESIDENT

In a noisy but orderly session of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters convention June 28, incumbent
President James P. Hoffa and challenger Tom Leedham both are
nominated for the union's top office.  Also nominated are
current IBT Secretary-Treasurer Tom Keegel and Leedham
running-mate Tom Gilmartin, the head of IBT Local 559 in
Connecticut. Delegate voting will occur late June 28 to
determine if the candidates received the requisite 5 percent
support for their names to be placed on the ballot for the
fall election among the union's 1.4 million members.

That Hoffa will receive 5 percent of the delegates' votes is
a foregone conclusion given his overwhelming support among
the more than 1,700 delegates. Voice votes on various
resolutions and constitutional amendments appear to show
that Leedham has the support of only a few hundred delegates
in his second challenge to Hoffa for the union presidency.
However, Leedham and members of his campaign appear
confident he will get the votes necessary to be placed on
the ballot. Other members of Leedham's slate earlier
received more votes than necessary to be placed on the
ballot. . . . Page C-1

OSHA READIES MANDATORY EMPLOYER SURVEY FOR DISTRIBUTION

The week of July 2 will signal the launch of the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration's annual
mandatory survey of more than 80,000 employers nationwide to
gather injury and illness data to better target high-hazard
employers. The agency, however, will not include
construction employers in the upcoming survey.

The 2001 survey program "improves OSHA's ability to identify
and target our  efforts on the more hazardous workplaces,"
acting OSHA Administrator R. Davis Layne says. The survey
requests calendar year 2000 data. OSHA inspections based on
the 2000 data will not be launched until January or February
of 2002, the OSHA spokesman says.

Employers will be asked to supply figures for average
employment, hours worked, and a summary of the job-related
injuries and illnesses that occurred at their work sites in
2000, the agency says.  The surveys must be returned even if
a surveyed employer recorded no occupational injuries or
illnesses for 2000, the agency says. . . . Page A-1

SENATE PASSES AIRPORT SECURITY BILL; BLOCKS WORKER RELIEF

Senate Democrats fail in their bid to bring to a vote an
assistance package for workers who have been laid off from
airlines, airports, and aircraft manufacturers in the wake
of recent terrorist attacks. The package was being offered
as an amendment to an airport security bill (S. 1447) that
won unanimous approval from the Senate.

A few hours before approving the security bill by a vote of
100-0, the Senate came four votes short of the 60 votes
needed to cut off debate and allow a vote on adding the
worker assistance package. Democrats who sponsored the
worker assistance package pledge to offer a similar measure
as an amendment to an economic stimulus package being
crafted by lawmakers. . . . Page AA-1

LABOR-HHS BILL MOVES IN HOUSE; SENATE CLEARS MEASURE FOR
FLOOR VOTE

The House late Oct. 11 was preparing to vote in favor of the
fiscal year 2002 spending bill (H.R. 3061) for the
departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
Education. Earlier in the day, the Senate Appropriations
Committee cleared its version of the measure for a vote on
the floor. Both the House and Senate measures have strong
bipartisan support, and the differences between the two
appear negligible with respect to funding levels for the
Labor Department.

Both of the $123 billion measures set DOL's FY 2002
discretionary funding levels at around $11.9 billion. This
represents an increase from the slightly more than $11.3
billion requested by the Bush administration and is more
than the nearly $11.7 billion allotted for FY 2001. In
addition to setting forth spending levels for Labor
Department programs and agencies, which are subject to
change pending a House-Senate conference, the reports
accompanying the bills contain directives reflecting certain
concerns on the part of various appropriators, such as
access to DOL's budget office and increases in workplace
fatalities among Hispanics. . . . Page A-10

NLRB RULES 2-1 STRIKE-NOTICE FAILURE DID NOT UNDO WORKERS'
PROTECTION

The failure of a union representing convention exhibit
workers in New Orleans to give prior notice of a strike did
not deprive the workers of protection under federal labor
law, the National Labor Relations Board rules in a 2-1
decision ("Freeman Decorating Co., "336 N.L.R.B. No. 1,
9/28/01 [released 10/10/01]). Members Liebman and Walsh
decide 11 contractors violated the National Labor Relations
Act by "terminating" hundreds of workers who previously had
obtained short-term jobs with any one of about 80
contractors through a hiring hall run by Local 39 of the
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. The
board finds the workers did not have an actual employment
relationship with the 11 contractors when the strike began
and therefore could not be deprived of protected employee
status by the union's failure to comply with the
strike-notice requirement.

Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen takes the view that the workers
lost their status as employees covered by the act when the
union failed to comply with Section 8(d). Having lost their
protected status, the contractors could legally discharge
the workers and refuse to hire them in the future, Hurtgen
says. "To adopt the position of my colleagues would mean
that the loss-of-status provision of Section 8(d) does not
operate in hiring hall situations," the chairman says. . . .

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RULES FOR NEW JERSEY CASINOS FOUND
UNCONSTITUTIONAL

A federal judge orders the New Jersey State Casino Control
Commission to eliminate the portions of its equal employment
opportunity regulations that required Atlantic City casinos
to set specific affirmative action goals for hiring
minorities and women, holding that the rules violated the
Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution ("Rudolph v.
Adamar of New Jersey, Inc., d/b/a Tropicana Casino and
Resort,"D.N.J., No. 00-CV-190, 10/10/01).

The brief order from Judge Orlofsky of the U.S. District
Court for New Jersey is entered as part of a pending class
action against the Tropicana Casino and Resort by former
employee John Rudolph, who alleged he and a class of other
white and male employees had been harmed by the
state-mandated policy.

The commission stopped enforcing the portions of the
regulations that were invalidated by Judge Orlofsky's Oct.
10 order more than a year ago, according to a commission
spokesman. But Rudolph's attorney says the order is
significant, in that it will require the commission to
notify each casino about the ruling and to take the
regulations off the books. "All of the casinos'
employment-related policies will have to be changed to
provide equal employment opportunity for everyone, without
concern for race or gender," she says. The casinos employ
more than 47,000. . . . Page A-2

ABRAHAM SAYS SUPPORT HAS GROWN FOR DATA FUNDING

Looking back at her eight years as head of the agency,
Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Katharine Abraham
says in an interview that she believes support has grown
among various constituencies for funding research and
improvements of key economic data programs. She is leaving
the agency after serving two terms as commissioner.

 During her tenure, which will end Oct. 12, Abraham says the
agency has been able to initiate new labor market measures,
including a survey of job openings and labor turnover that
will begin regular publication early next year. Also "the
BLS has been able to make improvements in just about all of
its major data series" in recent years, she says. . . . Page

NO ULP TO FIRED NURSE WHO CRITICIZED HOSPITAL  ON TV, EIGHTH
CIRCUIT FINDS

A Missouri hospital did not violate federal labor law when
it fired a prounion nurse who appeared on a local news
broadcast and accused the hospital of "jeopardizing the
health of mothers and babies" by altering shift assignments
and duties of certain labor and delivery nurses, the Eighth
Circuit rules ("St. Luke's Episcopal-Presbyterian Hospitals
Inc. v. NLRB,  "8th Cir., No. 00-3169,  10/10/01).

Denying enforcement of an order by the National Labor
Relations Board, Judge Loken disagrees with the board's
conclusion that St. Luke's Episcopal-Presbyterian Hospital
in Chesterfield, Mo., violated the National Labor Relations
Act by terminating registered nurse first assistant Carol
Hollowood based on protected concerted activity. There was
"overwhelming evidence" that Hollowood was fired because her
comments were false and disparaging to the hospital, and
they alienated her co-workers, the court decides. . . . Page

NLRB 4-0 APPROVES CROWN CORK'S USE OF SEVEN EMPLOYEE
COMMITTEES

Crown Cork & Seal's use of four production teams and three
other employee participation committees at its aluminum can
manufacturing plant in Texas does not violate federal labor
law, the National Labor Relations Board rules unanimously
("Crown Cork & Seal Co., "334 N.L.R.B. No. 92, 7/20/01
[released 7/25/01]).

Chairman Hurtgen and Members Liebman, Truesdale, and Walsh
agree with an administrative law judge's findings that the
seven committees are not employer-dominated labor
organizations. Rather than "dealing with" management in a
bilateral fashion of making proposals that are accepted or
rejected by management, the committees exercise authority,
delegated by management, to operate the plant within certain
parameters, the board decides.

Since the opening of Crown Cork's plant in 1984, the company
has used an employee management system called the
"socio-tech system" designed to delegate substantial
authority to employees to operate the plant through
participation on permanent and temporary teams, boards, and
committees that reach decision through discussion and
consensus. . . . Page AA-1,  Text E-1

COURT SAYS LESBIANS HAVE NO TITLE VII SUIT AGAINST
CHILDREN'S HOME

Two workers denied employment at the Kentucky Baptist Home
for Children Inc. because of their homosexuality failed to
establish that the employer violated Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act's prohibition against religious
discrimination, the U.S. District Court for the Western
District of Kentucky rules ("Pedreira v. Ky. Baptist Homes
for Children,  "W.D. Ky.,  No. 3:00CV-210-S,  7/23/01).

Granting summary judgment to KBHC on the Title VII claim,
Judge Simpson rules that Alicia Pedreira's and Karen Vance's
religious freedom was not intruded upon by the employer
because there was no evidence that their homosexuality was
premised on their religious beliefs or lack thereof.
However, the court finds that the two plaintiffs, joined by
seven others, may proceed with their lawsuit challenging on
constitutional grounds Kentucky's granting of public funds
to the home. . . . Page A-2

 KENNEDY TO ADDRESS GENETIC BIAS BILL'S OVERLAP OF ADA,
PRIVACY RULES

Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee
Chairman Kennedy (D-Mass.) says he will examine how current
law addresses genetic bias as the committee considers a bill
(S. 318) that would prohibit employers and health insurers
from discriminating against individuals based on their
genetic information.

At a committee hearing on genetic discrimination, several
Republican lawmakers express concern that the bill,
sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.), is not
consistent with current civil rights laws. Kennedy calls
those concerns "legitimate" and says most lawmakers agree
that legislation barring genetic discrimination should not
duplicate existing law. Kennedy says he expects Congress to
pass further legislation barring genetic bias, even after
taking into account the protections in current law.

Daschle says his bill would prohibit employers from making
employment decisions based on predictive genetic
information. The measure also would prohibit employers from
requesting, requiring, or disclosing a person's genetic
information without his or her informed consent, he says. .

UNION-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE CANNOT SUE FOR WRONGFUL DISCHARGE

A union-represented employee who was fired after filing a
workers' compensation claim cannot sue his employer for
wrongful discharge, a federal judge in Philadelphia rules,
dismissing the claim of a former American Red Cross employee
("Harper v. American Red Cross Blood Services, "E.D. Pa.,
No. 01-1676, 7/17/01).

"[W]e agree with other courts that the Labor Management
Relations Act would be frustrated if a plaintiff like [Gary]
Harper could 'end-run the grievance procedure outlined in
his collective bargaining agreement by filing a wrongful
discharge claim in court,'" writes Judge Joyner of the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
Although a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision permitted
wrongful discharge suits in a similar situation, the
employees in that case were at-will workers who did not have
union representation. . . . Page A-3

NEW CONTRACTS RAISE MANUFACTURING PAY 3.1 PERCENT ON AVERAGE

Data compiled by BNA in the first 30 weeks of 2001 show
newly bargained contracts in the manufacturing industry
provided a weighted average first-year gain of 3.1, compared
with 3.5 percent in 2000, while agreements in the
nonmanufacturing sector (excluding construction) produced a
weighted average increase of 4.1 percent, unchanged from the
comparable period in 2000. The current median manufacturing
increase was 3 percent, the same increase as reported a year
ago, and the median nonmanufacturing increase was 3.9
percent, compared with 3.4 percent.

Among new settlements included in the latest biweekly wage
tabulation are: a three-year contract between Maytag Co. and
the United Auto Workers; a three-year agreement between Walt
Disney World Co. and the Service Trades Council; and a
five-year agreement between the Building Contractors
Association of New York and the Laborers' International
Union. . . . Page D-1

HOUSE HEARING EXAMINES BENEFITS, RISKS OF EMPLOYER
INVESTMENT ADVICE

The potential benefits and risks of legislation that would
allow employers more leeway in providing investment advice
to employees participating in self-directed retirement
savings plans are debated in a hearing before the House
Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on
Employer-Employee Relations.

The risks inherent in enacting legislation (H.R. 2269) that
would allow employers to give employees access to investment
advice are outweighed by the need for increased access and
offset by safeguards to protect employees, says John Boehner
(R-Ohio), chairman of the House Education and the Workforce
Committee and sponsor of the Retirement Security Advice Act.

Ann Combs, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare
benefits, calls providing increased access to investment
advice a critical issue and says the Labor Department
supports the proposed amendments to ERISA. Committee
Democrats argue for expansion of safeguards to protect
employees and prevent abuses, while the AFL-CIO says the
bill would expose employees to the risk of being steered
toward high-fee investment products and could exacerbate
Section 401(k) losses. . . . Page AA-1

COURT REJECTS TRUCK DRIVERS' SUIT  ALLEGING WAGE SKIMMING BY
EMPLOYER

A group of Illinois truck drivers failed to show that their
employer breached its collective bargaining contract with
their union by skimming funds from their wages, the Seventh
Circuit rules, affirming a lower court's series of judgments
for the employer ("McLeod v. Arrow Marine Transport, "7th
Cir.,  No. 01-1060,  7/12/01).

The drivers could not prevail on their hybrid breach of
contract and duty of fair representation claim under Section
301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act against Arrow
Marine Transport Inc. unless they first could establish that
their union was not representing them fairly, Judge Bauer
explains. Finding that the drivers did not show that the
Chauffeurs, Teamsters and Helpers Union Local No. 301
breached its duty of fair representation by failing to
uncover the alleged wage-skimming scheme, the court affirms
the trial court's decision to grant the company summary
judgment as to claims brought by three of the plaintiffs and
to dismiss the claims of five other drivers. . . . Page A-8

NINTH CIRCUIT REVIVES 'EFFEMINATE' RESTAURANT WORKER'S
HARASSMENT CLAIM

A restaurant employee who allegedly was sexually harassed
because he was too effeminate should be able to take his
claim to trial under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,
the Ninth Circuit rules ("Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant
Enter. Inc., "9th Cir., No. 99-35579, 7/16/01). Reversing
summary judgment granted by the  U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Washington to Azteca Restaurant
Enterprises, the appeals court rules that Antonio Sanchez's
sexual harassment claims under Title VII and the Washington
Law Against Discrimination should survive because he was
singled out for harassment by male co-workers and a
supervisor who considered him feminine and believed he did
not meet their views of a male stereotype.

 Judges Gould and Reinhardt find that while Azteca did have
a sexual harassment policy in place and exercised reasonable
care to prevent sexual harassment, its response to Sanchez's
complaints was not sufficiently prompt to avoid liability.
Dissenting on the issue of vicarious liability, Judge
Wardlaw argues that Azteca's response was appropriate, and
Sanchez's failure to report further harassment to management
made him partly responsible for the company's inaction. . .

KMART VIOLATED ERISA IN USING WRONG INTEREST RATE, SAYS
COURT

Kmart Corp. violated the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act when it computed lump-sum pension plan distributions
using the wrong interest rate, the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of Illinois rules ("Tullock v. Kmart
Corp. Employee Pension Plan, "S.D. Ill., No. 99-CV-0289-DRH,
6/29/01). Judge Herndon finds that the retailer used the
incorrect "GATT rate" in computing the lump-sum
distributions by using the January 1997 rate of 6.83 percent
rather than the 1998 rate of 5.81 percent.

Kmart alleged that the January 1997 rate was the appropriate
one because, although the lump-sum distribution checks were
dated Feb. 1, 1998, the checks were sent out on Jan. 31,
1998.  Kmart cannot "alter the fact that the checks were
dated and thus distributed on February 1, 1998 by claiming
that it has discretion to determine what the word
'distribution' means," Herndon writes. . . . Page A-6

 WILHELM SAYS HERE NEEDS UNIFIED STANCE IN FACE OF HOTEL
CONSOLIDATIONS

As the hotel industry in North America continues to
consolidate under fewer and fewer major corporate owners,
the union that represents hotel workers must present a more
unified stance in negotiations, perhaps even coordinating
contracts so that individual locals can negotiate jointly
with the major hotel chains, John Wilhelm, president of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees says.

HERE should set minimum goals for all contracts, make card
check neutrality a demand in all negotiations, and
coordinate campaigns against the major chains, the number of
which has dwindled steadily from about 18 as recently as
1995 to only eight today--with still more consolidation
likely in the next few years--Wilhelm tells union members
attending HERE's convention in Los Angeles.  To counter that
trend, HERE must "knit together" a unified union, while not
losing the vitality of its various locals, Wilhelm says in
his keynote address. . . . Page C-1

SMOKE-SENSITIVE EMPLOYEE  CAN PROCEED IN ADA RETALIATION
CLAIM

A smoke-sensitive employee who was discharged after she
failed to report to work in a newly smoke-free office
building can proceed with a retaliation claim under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Fourth Circuit holds
("Rhoads v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., "4th Cir., No.
98-2374, 7/12/01).

Reversing a district court in Baltimore, the appeals court
says Lori Rhoads, a former financial analyst at a failed
Maryland bank, had provided enough evidence that her
discharge--for excessive unexcused absenteeism--was illegal
retaliation under the ADA. The Fourth Circuit reinstates the
claim against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in its
capacity as a receiver for Standard Federal Savings Bank and
its successor institution, Standard Federal Savings
Association.

 However, the court affirms summary judgment for the
employer on Rhoads's claim that the bank failed to
reasonably accommodate her disability under the ADA and on
her claim that the bank violated the Family and Medical
Leave Act. . . . Page A-1

SCALIA VOWS VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT AS LABOR SOLICITOR

The Bush administration's nominee for the top legal position
at the Labor Department vows that he would "vigorously"
enforce worker protection laws if confirmed, but Democrats
question whether his past views on a host of controversial
labor issues should disqualify him from the position. Eugene
Scalia defends his record on a number of DOL
regulations--including his criticism of the federal effort
to regulate ergonomics in the workplace--but also pledges
that he would abstain from policy areas that would be left
to the labor secretary and the heads of various DOL agencies
if he is confirmed. Scalia, selected in April as President
Bush's choice for labor solicitor, made his comments during
an appearance before the Senate Health, Education, Labor,
and Pensions Committee.

While Republicans attending the confirmation hearing praise
Scalia as uniquely qualified for the post, Democrats, led by
Sen. Kennedy (D-Mass.), express strong reservations about
the nominee. Scalia has come under fire chiefly for his
opposition to the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration's efforts to regulate ergonomics, but also
for his positions on wage and hour regulations and
enforcement of equal employment opportunity statutes. The
committee is set tentatively to vote Oct. 10 on the
nomination. . . . Page AA-1

TRUESDALE STEPS DOWN AS NLRB MEMBER, LEAVING BARE QUORUM

John C. Truesdale, who served in a variety of high-level
capacities during his 45-year career with the National Labor
Relations Board, steps down as a board member, following
through on his resignation submitted last May to President
Bush. The board now has a bare quorum of three members.
Truesdale's most recent stint on the board began in December
1998, when former President Clinton named him to a recess
appointment as chairman. The Senate confirmed Truesdale's
nomination in November 1999. Bush switched the chairmanship
to Peter J. Hurtgen (R) this past May, but Truesdale
continued as a member.

While Truesdale's (D) term does not officially expire until
August 2003, he made a pledge in November 1999 to step down
early and allow the new president to select a replacement.
In a May 24 letter to Bush, Truesdale said his resignation
would be effective when a successor was confirmed or the
president made a recess appointment or by Oct. 1 at the
latest. Bush has not taken action to replace Truesdale or to
fill a Republican seat that has been vacant since late
August 2000. . . . Page A-1

TWO-PRONGED APPROACH TO WORKER AID INCLUDES MINIMUM WAGE, UI
GAINS

Senate Democrats are crafting a two-pronged approach toward
passing a displaced worker assistance package that would
include an expansion of unemployment insurance benefits,
federal reimbursements for health insurance, and an increase
in the minimum wage.

The first set of provisions would be included with an
airport security bill that is expected to come to the Senate
floor Oct. 3 or Oct. 4, Senate Majority Leader Daschle
(D-S.D.) says. The proposal would take the form of a
"narrowly drawn unemployment package," he says, for workers
directly affected by the terrorist attacks.

The second set of provisions would be included in a broad
economic stimulus package currently being discussed with
congressional leaders and the administration. It could
include provisions that would expand the pool of eligible
recipients for new unemployment benefits and increase the
federal minimum wage in "addressing the needs of those who

COURT REJECTS WASTEWATER WORKERS' CHALLENGE TO DRUG-TESTING
PROGRAM

A federal district court in Minnesota throws out a lawsuit
brought by Minneapolis wastewater workers who said the
city's random drug-testing program violated their
constitutional rights against unreasonable searches and
seizures ("Geffre v. Metropolitan Council,  "D. Minn.,  No.
99-CV-715 (JMR/FLN), 9/26/01).

Metropolitan Council, the public agency responsible for
processing wastewater in the Minneapolis-St. Paul
metropolitan area, bargained with the plaintiffs'
union--Local 35 of the International Union of Operating
Engineers--for the policy, and union members consented to
the program by ratifying the collective bargaining
agreement, Judge Rosenbaum of the U.S. District Court for
the District of Minnesota holds. In addition, the policy was
reasonable because the workers held safety-sensitive jobs
and had a diminished expectation of privacy, the court
states. . . . Page A-4

ILO CONVENTION ON CHILD LABOR RATIFIED BY 100 COUNTRIES

The International Labor Organization says the world's
governments have moved "at a record pace" in ratifying a new
global agreement aimed at stamping out the worst forms of
child labor. With ratification by the Baltic state of
Estonia, the number of ILO countries that have ratified the
convention has reached 100, ILO says.

Adopted in June 1999, the convention calls on governments to
ensure that immediate steps are taken to suppress the worst
forms of child labor. The convention applies to children
under the age of 18, and signatories must adopt action
programs and report regularly to the ILO on efforts to
comply with its provisions. It was ratified and put in force
by the United States in November 2000.

Frans Roselaers, director of the ILO's International Program
on the Elimination of Child Labor, says the child labor
convention has achieved the fastest ratification pace of any
convention in the ILO's 82-year history.  . . . Page A-2

D.C. CIRCUIT OVERTURNS NLRB DECISION  ON 'SHAM' SALES,
BARGAINING ORDER

The National Labor Relations Board made inadequate findings
to support its decision that an affirmative bargaining order
was necessary because a mobile food catering business made
"sham" sales of catering trucks and routes to avoid
unionization, the District of Columbia Circuit rules
("Douglas Foods Corp. v. NLRB, "D.C. Cir., No. 00-1241,
6/12/01).

"While anti-union animus may well have motivated the
decision [by Douglas Foods Corp.] to sell the [ ] trucks and
routes, there is not substantial evidence to support the
NLRB's conclusion that the sales were 'sham' transactions,"
Judge Sentelle says. He vacates the board's order that the
company re-establish its hot truck operations, expressing
"grave doubts" about its legality even if sufficient fact
findings had been made. . . . Page AA-1

DOL STATISTICS SUGGEST DROP IN TRADE-RELATED JOB LOSSES

Recent Labor Department statistics suggest that there may be
a decline in U.S. job losses related to international trade.
The Labor Department determined in fiscal year 2000 that an
estimated 97,764 workers could be eligible to apply for
benefits under the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and
that 47,275 might be eligible for benefits under the North
American Free Trade Agreement's Transitional Adjustment
Assistance program. These figures compare with the 158,649
DOL estimated as eligible for TAA benefits and the 68,730
estimated as eligible for NAFTA-TAA benefits the previous
fiscal year.

The department certified 842 TAA cases and 403 NAFTA-TAA
cases in FY 2000, compared with 1,634 TAA cases and 518
NAFTA-TAA cases the previous fiscal year. Incidents in which
the department determined that workers could be covered by
both programs, "dual certifications," dropped to 260 from
384 last fiscal year. This corresponded with a fall in the
estimated number of workers covered under either program
from  54,769 to 31,617. . . . Page A-1

UNIONS UNFAZED BY "KENTUCKY RIVER"; ADVOCATES DEBATE NURSES'
STATUS

Undeterred by the Supreme Court's recent ruling rejecting
the National Labor Relations Board's latest test for
determining whether nurses are supervisors and therefore
unable to join a union, many unions representing health care
professionals say they will continue with organizing efforts
among nurses despite the adverse ruling.

In May, the justices ruled in "NLRB v. Kentucky River
Community Care Inc." that the board's test for deciding
whether a worker exercises independent judgment in
performing certain job tasks--and therefore qualifies as a
supervisor--was inconsistent with the National Labor
Relations Act. In so ruling, the court affirmed by a 5-4
vote a federal appeals court's refusal to enforce the
board's decision that six registered nurses at a health care
facility run by the Kentucky River Community Care Inc. were
not supervisors because they did not exercise independent
judgment in performing their duties.

Some health care employer advocates and labor lawyers agree
that bringing the issue back before the board could be a
daunting task. Not only is this the second time the Supreme
Court has shot down NLRB's attempt to characterize certain
nurses as nonsupervisors, but the changing political climate
may signal a board less inclined to tackle this issue again,
they said. Nonetheless, while advocates for employers and
employees debate the significance and possible ramifications
of the decisions, most health care employee unions continue
organizing efforts. . . . Page B-1

COMAIR, PILOTS REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO END 12-WEEK
STRIKE

 Union representatives for Comair pilots will begin contract
briefings June 18 on a tentative agreement that, if
ratified, will end a crippling 12-week strike against the
regional airline.  Details of the five-year contract are not
being released in advance of ratification, but  J.C. Lawson,
chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association's unit at
Comair, says the union is recommending adoption "because we
believe it satisfies the pilots' fundamental requirements."

 Comair's 1,350 pilots walked off their jobs March 26
following three years of unsuccessful contract negotiations.
Compensation, work rules, job security, and retirement
benefits were the sticking points of negotiations, according
to the pilots' union.      Tentative agreement came June 14,
after three days of intense negotiations between ALPA and
Comair management at National Mediation Board offices in
Washington, D.C.

 Pilots will be briefed on the agreement at informational
meetings June 18-19, the union said. ALPA members will then
vote by telephone June 20-21. If pilots approve the
contract, Comair planes could be flying again by July 15,
the company says. . . . Page A-4

STANCE OVERTURNED ON PREEMPTION OF WORKERS' MECHANIC'S LIENS

Mechanic's liens filed under Indiana law by a group of
union-represented workers seeking to secure unpaid vacation
pay from their economically failing employer were not
preempted  by the Labor-Management Relations Act, the full
Seventh Circuit rules in a 7-5 decision ("In re: Bentz Metal
Products Co. Inc., "7th Cir., No. 00-1320, en banc, 6/7/01).

Reversing a decision by a three-member panel of the court,
Judge Evans observes that the amount owed to the employees
of Fort Wayne, Ind.-based Bentz Metal Products Co. Inc., an
amount governed by the company's collective bargaining
agreement with  United Auto Workers  Local 2298, was not in
dispute. Therefore, the claim did not require an
interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and
was not preempted by the act, he finds.

Judge Bauer dissents, accusing the majority of
"side-stepping the law to reach an equitable result." Even
though the amount due to the Bentz workers was not in
dispute, Bauer says, preemption applied  because the workers
were seeking to enforce the bargaining agreement. . . . Page

JUMP IN FUEL PRICES LIFTS CPI 0.4 PERCENT IN MAY

Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in May as fuel prices
climbed higher for a second consecutive month, the Labor
Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reports. Excluding
the volatile food and energy components of the index,
consumer prices rose a slightly better-than-expected 0.1
percent in May, the smallest monthly increase since December
2000, BLS says.

 "This was a very favorable report. We were obviously
plagued by gasoline hikes that didn't show up in the [June
14 release of the] producer price index,  but price
pressures have generally been quite mild," says Carol Stone,
senior economist at Nomura Securities in New York. Mickey
Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York, was
less impressed by the report, saying that once price
increases for the housing component and the medical care
component begin to rise, "it is hard to stop the increase."

LABOR SECRETARY CHAO URGES FORUM TO KEEP OPEN MIND ABOUT
ERGONOMICS

Labor Secretary Chao defends her decision to hold a series
of forums on ergonomics and predicts that no matter what
approach the department takes, "we're going to make somebody
unhappy." The truth of that statement is evident as
organized union protesters greet the first forum with
placards calling on the Labor Department to issue a standard
to protect workers and criticizing the scheduling of
hearings. "The issue isn't about whether we should deal with
ergonomics injuries, it's about how we deal with them," Chao
says.

Pat Cleary of the National Association of Manufacturers says
the best ergonomics approach is one based on more scientific
research, more emphasis on best practices, and more clarity
regarding what is and is not work-related. He urges the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration to create a
clearinghouse of best practices. Eric Frumin, health and
safety director for the Union of Needletrades, Industrial
and Textile Employees, testifies that ergonomic programs
work for both employers and employees. Good ergonomics
programs improve productivity, reduce medical and disability
costs, and improve product quality, he says.  . . . Page

IBEW MEMBERS RATIFY ACCORD FOR 5,500 WORKERS AT NIAGARA
MOHAWK

A 40-month contract covering some 5,500 hourly employees at
Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. is narrowly approved by IBEW
local 97 members. In the final package, union negotiators
agree to adjustments in some benefit areas to free up
resources for other benefits that the local deems essential
to the membership, As a result, retirees will be paying
somewhat more in health premium costs, and the short-term
disability benefit and separation allowance are both now
less generous.

 An initial 3.25 percent general wage increase is
retroactive to the June 1 effective date of the agreement
with a further 3.25 percent next June and 3.75 percent in
2003. The job security provision. remains in the contract
and will apply to all employees currently on the payroll.
The provision assures employees with at least 10 years
service, whose jobs are abolished, an alternative position
at the same rate of pay. The language will not apply,
however, to employees hired after ratification.  . . . Page

STUDY SHOWS HIGH REVERSAL RATE FOR PLAINTIFFS' EEO VICTORIES

A disproportionate number of employment discrimination cases
won at trial by plaintiffs are reversed on appeal when
compared to cases won by defendants, according to a new
report by two professors at Cornell University Law School.

The study, by Theodore Eisenberg and Stewart Schwab,
maintains that from 1988-1997, 43.61 percent of plaintiff
trial victories were reversed in federal appeals courts,
although only 5.8 percent of defense trial verdicts were
overturned on appeal. The study also indicates that the gap
between reversal rates of plaintiffs and defendants is
larger for employment discrimination cases than any other
category of cases, including civil prisoner cases.

Speaking at a press conference to release the study, Schwab
says, "benign explanations for the large gap in reversals
are hard to come by" and argues that there is a "nationwide,
double standard" when it comes to reviewing claims brought
under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act. The study was commissioned by two law
firms that represent employment discrimination plaintiffs. .

COURT SAYS YAHOO! MUST REVEAL TO COMPANY IDENTITY OF
ANONYMOUS POSTER

An Internet service provider must disclose to a New Jersey
biopharmaceutical company the name of an anonymous Internet
user who, describing herself as a "worried employee," posted
confidential information about the employer on the ISP's
finance message board, the New Jersey Superior Court rules
("Immunomedics Inc. v. Jean Doe, a/k/a "moonshine _fr,"
"N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.,  No. A-2762-00T1,  7/11/01).
Although anonymous Internet speech ordinarily is protected
under the U.S. and New Jersey Constitutions, there was
sufficient evidence that plaintiff Jean Doe compromised that
right by breaching Immunomedics Inc.'s employee
confidentiality agreement by posting the messages, Judge
Fall decides.

In a separate case decided the same day, Fall affirms a
trial court's refusal to grant a similar motion requiring
Yahoo! to disclose to Dendrite International Inc. the
identity of an anonymous Internet user who posted allegedly
defamatory statements about that company's financial
dealings. Dendrite failed to show that the unidentified
Internet user--who may or may not have been a Dendrite
employee--posted any information that harmed the company,
the court ruled ("Dendrite Int'l Inc. v. John Doe No. 3,
"N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div.,  No. A-2774-00T3,  7/11/01). . .

SALOMON SMITH BARNEY AGREES TO BIAS SETTLEMENT

The investment brokerage firm Salomon Smith Barney Inc. will
pay $635,000 and offer salary increases and enhanced
promotional activities to a class of computer employees
claiming employment discrimination on the basis of race and
national origin, according to the terms of a settlement with
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission approved by a
federal judge "(EEOC v. Salomon Smith Barney Inc.
"S.D.N.YNo. 00-7402settlement approved 7/12/01).

The commission sued Salomon Smith Barney on behalf of 13
current or former employees of the company's Greenwich
Street Data Center in lower Manhattan, who alleged that they
were subjected to disparate treatment and to a hostile work
environment because of their race or national origin. Five
named plaintiffs, who EEOC identified as being African
American, Haitian, Nigerian, or West Indian, charged that
they and similarly situated employees had been subjected to
"repeated and offensive comments that created a hostile work
environment." . . . Page A-11
