Rick, thanks for doing this. We have been working on this for two years and 
needed some impetus from Corp. Zahid Dohadwala is our Internal Audit Manager 
by title and most of his activities over the past two years, outside of 
coordinating endless JV partner queries, has been documenting business 
processes and implementing, through team discussions, better practices and 
controls. 
We look forward to working with Sally.

Sally,  

I just wanted to send a quick congratulatory note on your promotion to 
Managing Director.  And a bit belated, a thank you for serving again as my 
PRC representative.  I was pleased with my outcome at year-end, and once 
again, was one of the few Analysts or Associates who was always kept informed 
about the process.  I appreciate your time and energy in representing me.

Nicole

Congratulations on your recent well deserved promotion to Managing 
Director.   I hope everything continues to go well for you and you continue 
to enjoy meeting the challenges of our organization.

As you may know, some months ago I decided to re-establish my consulting 
business and have recently launced that new effort.  Please let me know if 
there is any way that I can be of help to you and your organization.  
Following is an overview of the firm's areas of specialty:

- Succession Planning/Executive Continuity
- Executive Development
- Organizational Development/Change
- Executive Counselling/Coaching
- Management Training
- Employee Surveys
- Innovation
- Leadership

I can be reached at:

Executive Leadership Associates
Richard W. Amabile - President
P.O. Box 6417
Kingwood, TX 77235-6417

Telephone: (281) 361-3691
Fax:  (281) 361-9408
Email: ramabile@execlead.com
Website: execlead.com

Enron has requested a consulting contract and therefore I will continue to
work at my office here, as well as at my new offices mentioned above.
Therefore, you will likely be able to contact me at either location for the
next few months.

In my ten years of experience at Enron I have been responsible for
Intellectual Capital, Organization Development & Training, Executive
Development, etc. and I am looking forward to being able to continue to work 
directly with Enron and other companies interested in these areas.

                                                  Dick Amabile

Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point 
and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached 
memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.  This memo will be sent by 
Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume 
with regard to global operations.  I shared this in the staff meeting so that 
you would be the first to know.  I will still fulfill my role within ENA as 
VP of Energy Operations.  I will not be going away!  This expanded 
responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel 
and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the 
organization.

First of all congratulations on your promotion, it is well deserved.  You are 
really in some rarefied air, since there seem to be very few Managing 
Directors.

I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2 
1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is 
saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only 
informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory 
personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the 
people that I have talked to over the past few weeks. 

Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Hi Sally

Congratulations on your promotion!

I was hoping to congratulate you in person while you were in London - but you 
seemed really busy.  Every time you walked through our area I was on the 
phone!

Hope to catch up with you next week when I visit Houston.

Best wishes 

Amita

you the
information regarding a related initiative on which I have been working las=

and it's really an effort to measure business risks consistently across the=

I hope my group can be helpful in designing the general approach to this=20
problem.

Please, let me know what your thoughts are.
