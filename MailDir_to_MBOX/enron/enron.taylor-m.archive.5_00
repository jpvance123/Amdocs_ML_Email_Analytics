Tana:

Regarding our conversation, here are the new books we have created. They are 
not yet being traded but will be shortly (from what I understand).
Theresa Brogan will be heading up this operation.
Now that I think about it, I don't think porkbellies been traded on the 
NYMEX. Let me know if you need any more information.

Attached is an Approval Form that will have to be completed to request if we 
want to trade with a new counterparty or on a new reference credit. I have 
incorporated comments from Origination, Credit and Legal. But should you have 
any further comments please let me know ASAP, as I plan to introduce this 
form by the middle of next week. (Note that there will be two forms, one for 
bankruptcy swaps and one for other credit derivatives.)

We have set a target date of June 12 for the Transwestern Auction site to be 
available to customers. At this date, we will need to be publishing ETA's and 
PA's which reference EnronOnline, rather than Enron North America. 

Please advise if you anticipate any difficulties in getting the incorporated 
EnronOnline into place under Enron Corp. with appropriate ETA and PA 
assignments completed by this date.

If it is possible to have things in place sooner, obviously that would give 
us more breathing space. . .

Thanks,

Dave

Our VP in charge of admin in MG London Inc, Al Pennisi, has advised the CFTC
and
NYMEX verbally already that the Enron offer is on the table.

They have confirmed to him that they will only need a letter of confirmation
once the takeover is official. The letter will need to include an
explanation of
the new corporate structure (family tree). The "controller" equivalent term
for
the CFTC is "Material Associated Person". The appropriate regulation is
apparently 1.14 and 1.15 in thte CFTC regs.

If the corporate structure for MG London Inc could be confirmed asap,
similarly
to what we need here in London it would be a great help.

Tks and rgds.

Bob / Steve,

This is to inform you that, at last, I heard from the OMLX yesterday 
afternoon that they have signed the documentation for ECTRIC's Prop trader 
membership of the OMLX.  Please note that this does not mean at this stage 
that ECTRIC is a trading member of the Exchange as this is dependant on the 
following:

1. The OMLX are sending back to me the Clearing Agreement and one other 
document which require the signature of  our clearer, E.D.&F Man 
International Ltd in London.  (Apparently, although the OMLX has signed them, 
they require us to forward them to Man rather than for them to do this!!!!).  
Once Man's have signed them, then I shall need to file them with the OMLX 
once again.

Accordingly, please let me have:

(i) details of our contact at E.D.&F Man International Ltd in London; and

(ii) his/her telephone number so that I can speak to them and then arrange 
for these documents to be sent to them.

2. Steve needs to arrange  to take his SFA examination.  Once passed, he 
needs to let me (and Lin Richardson) know.  Under the OMLX's application 
procedure, I shall then need to write to the Exchange to let them know 
formally that Steve will be EEFT's trader and that he has passed his SFA 
exams.

Only once 1 and 2 have been completed will ECTRIC be admitted as a Prop 
trading member of the Exchange.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Mark

I don't like specifying a time period for termination. I remember we had a 
lengthy discussion on this with Mark Taylor. I seem to recall that the 
solution was that we would employ resonable efforts to process the 
termination request (please confirm with Mark). I don't think they will be 
happy with three days.

David:
Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with 
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them 
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?
Carol

Mark,

I am wondering if it is necessary to include a few more words in our index 
descriptors.

When we refer to a published index, should we add: "including published 
corrections", or is this obvious enough? 

I'm thinking that if there is an error in the index which is acknowledged as 
such in the publication, then the error would be seen as something which 
should be corrected if we ever went to court. I'm also thinking that we would 
not want to apply this kind of language on a go-forward basis, as to have two 
different treatments might prejudice our position (although the UK office 
wishes to add this language on a go-forward)

Thoughts?

Dave

Greg:
Can you help me answer this question?  Also, we have been through our ISDA 
forms and had the following questions with respect to Canadian law matters?

1. We have assumed that for all ISDA Masters where Canadian law applies, we 
should not insert our arbitration provision.  Is this correct?

2. With respect to the Trade Option exemption and Eligible Swap Participant 
reps that we normally insert in our form (which I have enclosed below), we 
have assumed that the only time that these reps should not be inserted is 
when the Master is between ECC and a Canadian or Foreign counterparty?  Is 
this correct?  What we are unsure about is whther these reps are needed when 
ECC's counterparty is a US entity.  We look forward to hearing from you.

Louise,

Thanks for your email.  Your list for power and gas products are fine. I
agree we can add products/markets going forward as appropriate.  We also
discussed posting your numbers for crude and products.  I believe we agreed
crude and products would not be part of any volume targets, but that we
would incorporate those products in the first round.  Please provide me a
list for crude and products based on what we offer on HoustonStreet.  Also,
any thoughts on whether you want to take me up on my offer to include your
numbers in Europe (UK, Germany and Scandanavia) and Japan for an additional
10% equity in each of those markets?  The reason I ask is that we are
engaged in liquidity partner discussions right now and your answer might
affect our decisions.  We are on target to go live in Europe this Summer.

As for corporate docs, we are prepared to deliver whatever you need to see
whenever it is appropriate.  Just let me know when you would like them and
I'll arrange to get them to the appropriate individual at Enron.

Regards,
Frank

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be
a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document
is in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal
wider than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to
introduce financial transactions?

(See attached file: product list.doc)

Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is
email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early
next week to go through the draft.

Regards

Louise

Subject:  Follow-up on Friday's meeting


Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from
my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate
individuals
on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
try to push this forward this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from
HoustonStreet.

Best regards,
Frank Getman

Subject: comments on the agreement draft


David,
Thank you for sending the agreement draft on Friday. Here are my notes after
the first reading. If you wish to discuss those further, perhaps we can
schedule a time on the phone.
Preamble: We are a Delaware corporation.
Section 1: Definition: the attrition rate per your definition is diluted by
the addition of new clients. The attrition rate should calculated based on
the number of existing clients at the beginning of the agreement without
taking new clients into account.
Section 3: Termination of the Agreement should be mutual, and we cannot
agree to keeping the Exclusivity at the same level through any renewal
periods.
Section 5: the definition of competitors is too broad. We would like to see
something that more tightly defines electronic trading of wholesale
commodities. We would like to retain the ability to offer these services in
areas where Enron Online is not active, such as supply chain systems, and in
the retail markets for large commercial and industrial concerns. Also, I am
not sure  whether this is intended, but your reference to "any Publication"
will give you exclusivity to ALL our publications for the fee set out in 4
a. That is not the intent.
Section 6 (b) should be removed (see comments on Section 1)
Section 10. we cannot agree to letting Enron disclose the existence of this
agreement without our consent. Any disclosure about this agreement,
including the fact of its existence, should be by mutual consent.
Section 12: we need a mirror section indemnifying us against all and any
claims against Enron Online. This would be a show-stopper for our lawyers.
Section 13: I am not sure we have such an insurance, but even if we did, I
am not sure why Enron is requiring this given that there is a clear
indemnification
Section 14 (a) three days seems unduly short. I would say 5 days is more
reasonable. There are no fee payments in advance, so I believe we can remove
mention of fees being paid back.
Section 17: we're really not looking for a monetary commitment from Enron on
helping us find illegal distribution. What is important to us is that Enron
has a contractual obligation to notify us immediately if it becomes aware of
any breach of copyright or illegal distribution. It would be good if that
were written into this section.
Section 29: typically, we do not agree to arbitration clauses for the simple
reason that these types disputes tend to end up in court anyway, and then
the two parties have spent money on arbitration and still have the legal
costs ahead of them. I believe we can live with this clause, but it would be
better if it were not there.
There might be a couple more points that come up from my colleagues or on a
second reading, but I believe these are the main sticking points at the
moment.

Abudi Zein

Sara:
Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that 
much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all 
counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have 
asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding 
exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues 
to cover on Friday involve:

1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard 
langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to 
whether NY or Texas law applies.

2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.  
For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a 
list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree 
with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.

3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.

I'm available anytime to talk about the above.

Carol

One of the things that Organic has asked us to keep confidential is "the 
existence of any business discussions, negotiations or agreements between the 
parties as well as any information regarding the skills and compensation of 
employees, contractors or other agents of the disclosing party."  This is a 
departure from our form.  Are we prepared to agree to this?  Also, to the 
extent that parties are insisting on using their form of CA, what do you want 
the approval process to be?

Steve,

Since our phone call, I spoke to Mark Taylor, who advised me that the local 
counsel is planning to come back to us next week with a detailed opinion 
regarding the taxation issues for trading in Brazil and Argentina.

Under these circumstances, it seems wise to postpone our planned conference 
call until after outside counsel has responded.

However, I remain concerned about this issue. As discussed, if we are unable 
to formulate a plan which we believe has a good chance of succeeding, and if 
the tax regime is so penal as to make trading on EnronOnline prohibitively 
expensive, then we need to seriously reevaluate the timetable for EnronOnline 
and postpone preparation efforts until such time as either the tax regime 
changes or we identify a way around the tax restrictions.

I will contact you later next week after we hear from outside counsel. 
Hopefully their response will put my concerns to rest. 

Dave

I agree with Leslie - and we need to be careful about names Affiliates, too. 
Each Master User ID is intended for use by one legal entity. If the Affiliate 
is just a trading name and is the same legal entity, then we are OK - but if 
they are a separate legal entity, then we have problems with:

a) The ability of one entity to bind another
b) Credit headroom allocations and netting between entities.

We should restrict the Master User ID and ETA to be applied to a single legal 
entity only.

Carol, I am not comfortable with an exclusion of affiliates from Section 
2(a).  Instead, I think we need to include an express carve out that provides 
that the CP cannot utilitize the Website on behalf of third parties except 
for [Name of Principals] pursuant to [Name of Agency Agreement].

David:
GPU Energy had the following comments to the ETA:

1.  In Section 2(a) they want Enron to represent that it owns and has the 
legal right to grant to Counterparty the use of the Website.  Also, in the 
second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf 
of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper 
exclusion given our conversation this week about who will be applying for the 
Website password?]

2. They have deleted Section 4(b) and seem to think that we should provide a 
similar indemnity.


I can handle point #2, but what do you think about point #1?

Carol

Richard:
In reviewing our ISDA forms we had the following questions for you with 
respect to the arbitration and process agent language:

1. Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language?  I have 
enclosed what we currently use.  Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial 
even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be 
enforced in court?  Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be 
enforced in court?

2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process 
agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or 
maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada.  Is this a correct 
assumption?  Enclosed is our process agent language.

I look forward to hearing from you.  As we discussed last week, we will 
arrange a time that you can talk generally to our group about arbitration 
issues and questions.

Alan further to our discussion last week. Attached is request for further

counterparties through EOL. As discussed would you forward it to B & M. The 
date of the previous advice which indicated there are no regulatory issues 
with weather trading needs to be inserted in 2 places. (Would you be able to 
send me a copy of this advice.) 

We need to have all legal issues resolved prior to 23 June.   This is the 
scheduled date for function the public function to launch of EOL weather 
trading in Australia .  We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka   in addition to 
Australian cities. There was discussion of  Seoul weather products but this 
has not progressed. If it does then will need to do the required due 
diligence for Korea.

Alan further to our discussion last week. Attached is request for further 
advice from Baker and McKenzie on trading weather products with Japanese 
counterparties through EOL. As discussed would you forward it to B & M. The 
date of the previous advice which indicated there are no regulatory issues 
with weather trading needs to be inserted in 2 places. (Would you be able to 
send me a copy of this advice.) 

We need to have all legal issues resolved prior to 23 June.   This is the 
scheduled date for function the public function to launch of EOL weather 
trading in Australia .  We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka   in addition to 
Australian cities. There was discussion of  Seoul weather products but this 
has not progressed. If it does then will need to do the required due 
diligence for Korea.

this is another publication we are seeking to put on EnronOnline.  This party 
had their own contract, so please take a look and lets discuss.  The deal is 
pretty simple:  We pay 25,000 for a one year deal.  No user counts, or fees, 
or attrition.  Just 25K for unlimited use.  They publish monthly but have 
committed to going to twice a month.

thanks
Dave

In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in
detail.

1.  The Issue

The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12,
i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim
that the transaction is not binding because:

(a) it was outside the company's business purposes, or
(b) execution of the application was not authorized.

This issue is not unique to Japan

There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading
of any of the products through the internet, including issues as to 
contractual
enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advised
on 15 March.  A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email.

Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the 
Electronic
Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the 
contract.
(We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.)

2.  Enron's Practice re EOL

Our understanding is that:

* Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover
of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application.  
Neither
the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form.

* Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit
standpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm the
authority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking 
if
the signatory shows the title "director" alongside his name).

* If satisfied, Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application
and issues a password.

* Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of 11am today and
none has yet been approved.

3.  Business Purposes

Article 43 of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and
obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its
constituent documents.  Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its
business purposes, the contract is prima facie void.

However, if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the 
power
of the corporation, and was not negligent in failing to know such fact, the
contract will be enforced under Article 110 of the Civil Code.

The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the
counterparty's business purposes (certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by 
a
representative director) and form a view on whether the proposed transaction
falls within those purposes.

However, since Japanese companies' business purposes, after listing a limited
number of specific purposes, generally include a final item along the lines of
"all incidental or ancillary business", it is common for companies to not make
this inquiry except in the most major contracts.

With respect to statutory corporations, however, care is required because 
often
their business purposes are in fact limited.

Accordingly, a rule of thumb solution would be: if the counterparty name does
not contain "Kabushiki Kaisha" or "Yugen Gaisha" at the end of the name, to 
make
further inquiries.

4.  Authority to Bind the Company - The Law

The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the
sense that:

(a)  Deemed Authority

The law provides for a form of execution which, if followed, entitles a party 
to
presume that the company is bound.  In Japan, this involves the execution of a
contract by the company's "representative director".  This corresponds to the
presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the 
US
and in the UK, and the execution of the contract by 2 directors in Australia.

It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted 
by
law or the constituent documents of the corporation. (Article 53 of the Civil
Code) but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction, the contract 
is
still binding on the company.

(b)  Apparent Authority

In common, with other countries, Japan has a concept of apparent authority.
Article 262 of the Commercial Code provides:

 "A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done
by a director invested with any title such as president, vice president,
executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he 
has
authority to represent the company, even in cases where the person has no 
power
of representation."

Articles 37 and 38 of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to "general
managers" (so shihainin).  It is generally considered that Article 43 then
applies the concept to "an employee who has been entrusted with certain types 
of
matters or specific matters."

Accordingly, in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article 262
(above), the general view is that persons having titles such as general 
manager
and division manager (bucho), will be deemed to have the authority to 
represent
the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the 
company's
business for which they are responsible.

It is also likely that section managers (kacho) or section chiefs (kakaricho)
have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are
responsible.

(e)  Holding Out

Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority, if
the company has held the employee out as having authority, the company will be
bound by his/her action.

5.  Practical Considerations

In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law, 
the
following factors are relevant:

(a)  Practice regarding Representative Director Seal

It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the 
presumption
referred to in 4(a) above by requiring the representative director's corporate
seal to be affixed (and, if contract is in English, for him to sign) or  to
insist on tracing the "chain of authority" of the signatory up to the
representative director (e.g. by power of attorney), for major or unusual
transactions.

(b)  Size of Transaction

The question is what transactions fall into the "major" or "unusual" category.

Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn.  As in
many other countries, the answer depends on factors such as those noted in 
(c),
(d) and (e) below, which vary company by company.

Accordingly, where the contract involves (or could involve) a considerable
ongoing exposure by the company, Japanese corporations would not be surprised 
to
be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level, or for written 
confirmation
of the signatory's authority to be obtained from a person at such level.

(c)  Size of Company

While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative
director's seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case 
of a
smaller company, it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a
major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty, in which
companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority.

(d)  Business Department of Signatory

The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority
doctrine if the signatory is in (and carries a title which refers to) the
relevant business department (e.g. energy), than if he is not.

(e)  Degree of Exposure

To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to 
expose
the counterparty to considerable liability, the possibility of a counterparty 
in
the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a
reasonably conservative approach.

(f)  Recent History

However, even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic
crisis, Japanese companies (at least major companies) have not generally
attempted to use lack of authority as a defense, presumably because of
reputation considerations.

(g) Identity of Addressee

The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant.
For example, if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department,
but the application came from a section chief, there would be strong argument
that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary
authority.

(h)  Internal Procedures

Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be
considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in
some countries, and by two directors in for example Australia, the Japanese
rules are not out of line with those of other countries.

Accordingly, it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent 
approach
to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other
countries.  The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for
Japan as well, although some adjustment will need to be made for Japan's 
unique
regime of company titles.

6.  Conservative Approach

If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for 
the
counter-party, under common practice Enron would require:

* The application to be executed under the registered seal of (and counter
signed by) a representative director, or by a person who is able to produce
documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative
director.

* A certified copy of the seal register.

* A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal
Affairs Bureau, to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the
representative director.

7.  Less Conservative Approach

Major Companies

For major Japanese trading companies, banks, insurance companies and other
companies of equivalent size, the following approach could be adopted which
would not be out of line with market practice:

* The application to be executed by a manager (or general manager)(bucho)
of the relevant department or above, or

* By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party.

A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a
person at the level of section manager (kacho) or section chief (kakaricho), 
but
this is right "on the line" and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there 
is
some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an
apparent authority argument.

Smaller Companies

For other companies the approach would be as set out in 6. above.

Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for
dividing between small and large companies.

8.  Likely Response of Target  Companies

Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view 
but,
taking into account Japanese commercial practice, we do not believe any 
company
is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an
application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach,
particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with 
the
correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no
applications have yet been approved.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a "physical" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

Louise,

Sorry I forgot to answer your financials question.  We already have
financial swaps for gas.  Financial electricity we can add very quickly with
someone's design assistance.  We only need minimal help to validate product
specification.  Functionality won't change.

I'm sorry if I was unclear on Europe/Japan.  I agreed that if you give us
your numbers in those markets you would get 10%, but I need to know whether
you are going to do that as part of this deal so I can complete other
liquidity partner discussions accordingly.  It wasn't intended as an open
option.  We can discuss Europe and Japan in the future, I'm just not sure I
can guarantee you 10% at that time.  I've got my Board primed if we do it
right now.  Perhaps we could agree that we will do it and you get your 10%
in each entity now, but that the actual technology link doesn't start until
later this year?

Regards,
Frank

I thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%,
ie an option we could decide on later.

Any idea also on the financial date as our guys do not think we can make
any volume targets without it.  We are working on crude and products.

Also Mark please liaise with Frank on the documentation you require from
him.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

Thanks for your email.  Your list for power and gas products are fine. I
agree we can add products/markets going forward as appropriate.  We also
discussed posting your numbers for crude and products.  I believe we agreed
crude and products would not be part of any volume targets, but that we
would incorporate those products in the first round.  Please provide me a
list for crude and products based on what we offer on HoustonStreet.  Also,
any thoughts on whether you want to take me up on my offer to include your
numbers in Europe (UK, Germany and Scandanavia) and Japan for an additional
10% equity in each of those markets?  The reason I ask is that we are
engaged in liquidity partner discussions right now and your answer might
affect our decisions.  We are on target to go live in Europe this Summer.

As for corporate docs, we are prepared to deliver whatever you need to see
whenever it is appropriate.  Just let me know when you would like them and
I'll arrange to get them to the appropriate individual at Enron.

Regards,
Frank

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be
a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document
is in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal
wider than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to
introduce financial transactions?

(See attached file: product list.doc)

Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is

Subject:  Follow-up on Friday's meeting


Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from
my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate
individuals
on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
try to push this forward this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from
HoustonStreet.

Best regards,
Frank Getman

Mark,

During my conversations with Patrick Hansen (from the Buenos Aires office) 
yesterday he mentioned that in Argentina the above mentioned contracts have 
to be in Spanish to have legal value. Is that correct? Or we would be covered 
as long as we offer the contracts in Spanish in addition to English 
(functionality currently present at the site)?

Thanks,

Mario

If the NDA is the Confidentiality Agreement for the Energy Trading Platform 
(group of six?), I have marked it up with only those revisions I thought 
essential (having discussed them with Andy) and am now waiting to hear back 
regarding where I should send it (have left voice mail for Greg and Andy is 
checking).

If the NDA is something else, please let me know.

Below is slightly revised language to be included in the ISDA agreement being 
entered into in connection with the EEX transaction.  Not having the 
transaction documentation to review in connection with this clause, I have 
bracketed several portions of the clause to be filled in as dictated by such 
documentation.  Please call with any follow up.  Steve.

Subject: Language for the Confirmation

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by [Enron Re] of the [Floating - this assumes that Enron Re is paying 
such amount] Amount will be treated as a payment pursuant to a guaranty by 
[Enron Re][of the obligations of Bob West Treasure, LLC to make payments 
pursuant to Section ___ of the [underlying Financing Agreement between Bob 
West Treasure and Royal Bank of Canada - this needs to be clarifed - is the 
payment related to the RBC loan or the insurance payment by EFR?  If it is 
the RBC loan then this clause is appropriate but if, alternatively, it is the 
EFR insurance payment, then the reference needs to be changed accordingly.]]  
The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is required to 
report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to the 
Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, such party shall 
report such item consistent with the characterization set forth above and 
shall not take any position on any tax return or report relating to United 
States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with such 
characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they have 
agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income tax 
purposes may be different from the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for non-United States federal income tax purposes and for 
accounting, regulatory or other purposes.  The provisions of this Section are 
not intended to affect the manner in which the parties report the Transaction 
for such other purposes, or the interpretation of the provisions of the 
Confirmation and the rights and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, 
for any purposes.

Subject: MG acquisition and EOL trades

I am aware that we will be offering some MG products (once the acquisition is 
complete) via EOL and want to highlight a few issues upfront:

1. MG Limited is a SFA regulated entity
2. The intention is that the MG acquisition will be held by an off balance 
sheet fund by the end of the year. This means that MG entities will not be 
subsidiaries of Enron Corp. I wonder whether there are any legal or 
regulatory issues arising from offering the bid/offer prices of 
non-subsidiaries via EOL (or maybe a wholly owned Enron sub posts the prices 
and then hedges with MG ?).

Regards
Janine

Ricardo;

Please be advised that Pinheiro Neto has been engaged as local counsel to 
prepare a memo with respect to the legal framework to implement EOL in 
Brazil.  Lacaz Martins has not been engaged as local counsel to EOL; Lacaz 
Martins has been engaged to act as counsel to a Direct Sales deal.  If you 
want to take advantadge of Lacaz Martins' legal opinion (Direct Sales deal) 
because it will also address an important tax issue under the EOL business, 
please note that Lacaz Martins is not counsel for EOL and Pinheiro Neto would 
have to review such opinion.

Rgds,

Further to some of your comments including the one from Paul Simons below, we 
should work to establish some general policies. The ones from Legal seem to 
be straightforward enough. We need however to discuss how they should be 
implemented to make all parties satisfied.

Credit: Could we discuss your requirements for immediate clearance.

Finally, we need to establish on which platform these approvals will be 
managed. The Approval Form that I sent around previously is acceptable for ad 
hoc request (or at least with the current level of requests), but going 
forward I think that we will require some kind of database, may be like the 
EOL counterparty database.

In the meantime, I will send out procedures for the introduction of the 
Approval Form.

Regards

Tomas

_____________________________________________

I think that the "general policies" route is the right (and only) one - 
particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a 
legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all 
clear, provided
in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty 
of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).  
We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not 
per se a legal task)
in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location
in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location

Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in 
the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as 
generically as possible.  

Hope this gives a sense of where we're coming from.  Please call me to 
discuss further if need be.

Paul

Mark, Jason and Sara:

Deutsche Bank has requested that we make various "Securities Act" reps in the 
ISDA Schedule in the event that we do equity derivatives.  These reps require 
us and them to say:

1. To the extent that a Transaction involves the purchase and sale of 
securities, it will not be registered and the securities cannot be sold 
except pursuant to a reg statement or exemption.

2. Each party is a QIB or an accredited investor.

3. Unless otherwise set forth in a Confirmation, any securities that a party 
is required to deliver shall not at the time of delivery constitute 
restricted securities or be subject to restrictions on transfer.

What do you think about this?

Carol

Dale ---

In answer to you questions:

a.) We have traded this directly before and have just looked at it as two 
individual deals....a baseload purchase at index, and a sale at index plus 
some number with daily nom flex of zero to whatever is negotiated as the 
daily max.  Example: Sitara deals #246931 and #246926

b.) These would definitely be separate products priced separately.  I would 
expect a 3-day, 5-day, and 10-day product with a different two-way for each.

c.) Hopefully the other answers help here.

d.) To the extent that the deals are like the ones I mentioned in a.), can 
they bridge to Sitara (at least the baseload piece)?

e.) We'll have to decide at what time the customer would have to give notice 
(for now let's assume 9:30 am central).  The customer can make the 
nomination  daily and would only need to notify us if they/we are going to 
take the gas under the second part of the deal (the non-baseload).  In other 
words, the   default would be zero, unless the customer or Enron (whoever 
bought the service) nominates by 9:30 am.

FYI, the expectation is that there would be 3 products (at this point).  The 
3-day would naturally be more expensive than the 10-day.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  I'm hoping, that if we view 
the product as two separate deals, that will make things much easier 
system-wise.

Scott

Scott -

Thanks for the explanation.  A few questions/comments for you all:

a) Have we been trading this Product OTC in the past, or is this 
unprecedented? Naturally if we've done this in the past it will be a lot 
easier to develop the language for the Product Description. Joe; ever seen 
this?

b) Are we creating a single Product where the customer has the ability to 
choose either 10-day, 5-day, or 3-day delivery, or are these three different 
Products one 10-day, one 5-day, and once 3-day. I worry about having one 
Product where the customer has the choice between the three because each 
'trade' has a Sigma Factor that helps value the transaction. I think it would 
be very difficult for RAC to assign a Sigma Factor to a single Product Type 
which allows three possible scenarios, and that SigF ultimately assists 
Credit in determining headroom. Tom and Bjorn; any comments?

c) For the same reason above, it may be difficult to create a pricing 
algorithm that will give you a good value in the Position Summary. I presume 
the level of difficulty for questions b and this issue will be determined by 
the answer to question a. 

d) Clearly these Products will not bridge into Sitara/TAGG, so we also have 
to think about how the risk folks will identify these trades so they know how 
to book them. Jennifer; any comments?

e) Using your example below: How much notice does the customer have to give 
before noms take place? Is it a one time notice to designate all five days, 
or can the customer call five different times, each time one day prior to 
each nom?

David; am I missing anything?

Subject: New EOL Products for TCO

Dale -

We would like to create the following products:

TCO Pool Physical Flexibility (3-day, 5-day, and 10-day)

Pipeline: Columbia Gas Transmission
Trading Point: TCO Pool
Term:  1 Month
Volume: Monthly Quantity

Description ---

Buyer will deliver a fixed baseload quantity to Seller at Inside FERC TCO 
Pool Index.

Seller will deliver to Buyer, on Buyer's choice of days, up to a maximum 
daily volume of 10% (10-day), or 20% (5-day), or 33% (3-day) of the monthly 
quantity, at Inside FERC TCO Pool Index plus the price of the product.

Buyer is obligated to take all volumes back by the end of the month.  (Net 
volume to each party should be zero.)

Example: Company X lifts Enron's offer for TCO Physical Flexibility at $0.03 
for 300,000 MMBtu in June with 5-day payback.

  Company X will deliver to Enron's TCO Pool 10,000 MMBtu everyday in June.

  On five days of Company X's choosing, Company X can take delivery at TCO 
Pool from Enron of up to 60,000 MMBtu/d.  Company X may take   anywhere from 
0-60,000 MMBtu on any day, provided they can only take a maximum quantity of 
300,000 MMBtu for the month.  Company X must   take all 300,000 MMBtu by the 
end of the month.

  Company X will charge Enron TCO Pool Index for volumes it delivers to Enron.
  
  Enron will charge Company X TCO Pool Index plus $0.03 for volumes it 
delivers to Company X.

I'm sure you'll have questions, so please call me at x-36736 and I'll be 
happy to go over it with you.

Thanks,

Scott

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like

finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to

to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or

Thanks for your note.  In reply:

1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section.

2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't
provide for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely
that SR will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited
Threshold for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral
under that document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made
to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't
make much of an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't
mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this
document.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.

Mark

I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's
comments.  I see no problems except:

1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the"United
Kingdom."   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say
"England," as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g.,
Scottish) within the U.K.

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

Carol, I am not comfortable with an exclusion of affiliates from Section 
2(a).  Instead, I think we need to include an express carve out that provides 
that the CP cannot utilitize the Website on behalf of third parties except 
for [Name of Principals] pursuant to [Name of Agency Agreement].

second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf

Mark,

As a follow up to our conversation of the phone today, 
I have a question for clarification.
I also have an additional question.

Clarification:   Are we clear that the New Co. will be in place by July 1?
            In addition, are we clear that we will know the name of New Co. 
by Shelley's May 31 (next Wed.) 
            meeting with FERC?  She is meeting with FERC to explain what we 
are going to do.

Additional Question:  Can we make the name change in the Password Agreement 
and ETA by next Wed?
            We would like this change so we can do a demonstration for the 
FERC and have the
            name of the appropriate company pop up.

Thanks for your attention. 

Frazier

I don't like specifying a time period for termination. I remember we had a 
lengthy discussion on this with Mark Taylor. I seem to recall that the 
solution was that we would employ resonable efforts to process the 
termination request (please confirm with Mark). I don't think they will be 
happy with three days.

Here is a draft of the ETA amendment letter that we have been discussing with 
Kennecott.  It includes my proposed modifications to deal with giving them 
the termination right which I have highlighted.  The current ETA states that 
all notices become effective immediately.  I have inserted in my language a 3 
day period after we receive a termination notice before it becomes 
effective.  This creates a difference between Us and our Counterparty's since 
our termination notice would become effective immediately.  What do you 
think?  Do we need this 3 day period or are you okay with having their 
termination notice becoming effective on the date of our receipt?

Subject: Re: Japan, Argentina and Brazil  

Mario,

Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan 
(Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open 
issues to follow-up on.

Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office 
receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment 
should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further, 
they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to 
financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical 
product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax. 

Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with 
respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some 
further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where 
our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response 
shortly.

One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of 
the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other 
Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan 
to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of 
determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as 
they occur.

Best regards,
Susan

Mario is away until next week.

The Japanese could trade with any Enron office which is posting commodities 
on EnronOnline - but are most likely to be interested primarily in the 
products posted by Singapore (global products), as it provides the best 
timezone overlap. Both physical and financial are possible, but none of the 
physical delivery locations on EnronOnline are currently in Japan.

online trading with the other Enron trading offices?  If so, which offices 
would they be trading with and what kind of products would be traded?  For 
example, would there be physical settlement (or delivery) of product in Japan 
to the Japanese customers or would there be only financial derivatives traded?

I really appreciate your help on this.

I have a conference call set up with our Japanese tax counsel this evening 
(Thursday evening Houston time).  After the call, I should be able to confirm 
that there are no major Japanese tax issues once our Japan office commences 
trading with Japanese counterparties through Enron Online.

However, I understand that initially, the Japan Online implementation will 
only entail Japanese counterparties trading internationally (e.g. trading 
non-Japanese products).  Based on this assumption, I think we're okay for 
Monday from a Japanese trading office perspective.  Please let me know if my 
understanding is incorrect.

You are right. For the launch of EnronOnline in Japan, local clients will be 
offered the ability to trade existing EOL products. Japanese products will be 
offered in  the future. 

Please be advised, though, that Singapore products are likely to be added to

Singapore products, in addition to the ones currently available.

Attached is a draft price reporting policy to address the Platt's issue we 
discussed.  As I indicated, a number of energy companies have asked for such 
a policy.  We thought that from an industry prospective unifying around a 
single policy made sense.  This policy is an attempt to address the concerns 
we have discussed.  I would appreciate your comments with a view toward 
creating what might be an industry standard in this area.

Mario,

Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan 
(Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open 
issues to follow-up on.

Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office 
receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment 
should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further, 
they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to 
financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical 
product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax. 

Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with 
respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some 
further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where 
our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response 
shortly.

One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of 
the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other 
Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan 
to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of 
determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as 
they occur.

Best regards,
Susan

Mario is away until next week.

The Japanese could trade with any Enron office which is posting commodities 
on EnronOnline - but are most likely to be interested primarily in the 
products posted by Singapore (global products), as it provides the best 
timezone overlap. Both physical and financial are possible, but none of the 
physical delivery locations on EnronOnline are currently in Japan.

Mario,

Thanks for your e-mail.  I wanted to follow up on one more point just to make 
sure we have everything covered for May 1st.  Do we expect the Japanese to do 
online trading with the other Enron trading offices?  If so, which offices 
would they be trading with and what kind of products would be traded?  For 
example, would there be physical settlement (or delivery) of product in Japan 
to the Japanese customers or would there be only financial derivatives traded?

I really appreciate your help on this.

Best regards,
Susan

I have a conference call set up with our Japanese tax counsel this evening 
(Thursday evening Houston time).  After the call, I should be able to confirm 
that there are no major Japanese tax issues once our Japan office commences 
trading with Japanese counterparties through Enron Online.

However, I understand that initially, the Japan Online implementation will 
only entail Japanese counterparties trading internationally (e.g. trading 
non-Japanese products).  Based on this assumption, I think we're okay for 
Monday from a Japanese trading office perspective.  Please let me know if my 
understanding is incorrect.

Best regards,
Susan

The marketing material is on its way to Tokyo. This Friday it is expected to 
be sent to clients. 

As you can see, time is something that we don't have. Could you please let us 
know if we are OK to go with the Japanese launch?

You are right. For the launch of EnronOnline in Japan, local clients will be 
offered the ability to trade existing EOL products. Japanese products will be 
offered in  the future. 

Please be advised, though, that Singapore products are likely to be added to 
EnronOnline before the Japanese launch. We expect Japanese clients to trade 
Singapore products, in addition to the ones currently available.

Thanks,

We have begun discussions with a Tokyo law firm regarding the various 
Japanese tax issues related to EnronOnLine.  In that vein, can you please 
clarify whether ENA will be offering certain Japanese counterparties the 
ability to trade existing EOL products (i.e., products that are not 
Japanese-based) and that such offering will commence in May, 2000, while no 
Japanese products will be offered until sometime in the future? 

If you would, please reply to all listed above so that we can hold 
discussions this evening with out Japanese tax advisors.

Thanks for your help, and best regards,

Japan is obviously the country that worries me the most since we intend to

The marketing material is expected to be sent by late next week.

Please let me know how long the process for Japan may still last and if you 
anticipate problems.

Brazil and Argentina are expected be launched this summer.

At first glance, this looks exactly like the type of process we're looking to 
semi-automate using our new workflow tools.  Later this week, we should have 
a plan that includes this.

Although this makes a lot of sense, how are going to implement it?  We plan 
to scale massively and I cannot imagine that this will be efficient enough to 
facilitate the time frames and number of reference credits that we are 
anticipating.  I think that we need to have a general policy that we can look 
to instead of approving them on a one off basis.

Let's discuss

Subject: Credit Trading - Approval Form

Attached is an Approval Form that will have to be completed to request if we 
want to trade with a new counterparty or on a new reference credit. I have 
incorporated comments from Origination, Credit and Legal. But should you have 
any further comments please let me know ASAP, as I plan to introduce this 
form by the middle of next week. (Note that there will be two forms, one for 
bankruptcy swaps and one for other credit derivatives.)

		 Subject: Enron Online: Counterparty Authority


In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in
detail.

1.  The Issue

The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12,
i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim
that the transaction is not binding because:

(a) it was outside the company's business purposes, or
(b) execution of the application was not authorized.

This issue is not unique to Japan

There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading
of any of the products through the internet, including issues as to 
contractual
enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advised
on 15 March.  A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email.

Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the 
Electronic
Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the 
contract.
(We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.)

2.  Enron's Practice re EOL

Our understanding is that:

* Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover
of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application.  
Neither
the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form.

* Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit
standpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm the
authority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking 
if
the signatory shows the title "director" alongside his name).

* If satisfied, Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application
and issues a password.

* Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of 11am today and
none has yet been approved.

3.  Business Purposes

Article 43 of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and
obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its
constituent documents.  Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its
business purposes, the contract is prima facie void.

However, if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the 
power
of the corporation, and was not negligent in failing to know such fact, the
contract will be enforced under Article 110 of the Civil Code.

The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the
counterparty's business purposes (certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by 
a
representative director) and form a view on whether the proposed transaction
falls within those purposes.

However, since Japanese companies' business purposes, after listing a limited
number of specific purposes, generally include a final item along the lines of
"all incidental or ancillary business", it is common for companies to not make
this inquiry except in the most major contracts.

With respect to statutory corporations, however, care is required because 
often
their business purposes are in fact limited.

Accordingly, a rule of thumb solution would be: if the counterparty name does
not contain "Kabushiki Kaisha" or "Yugen Gaisha" at the end of the name, to 
make
further inquiries.

4.  Authority to Bind the Company - The Law

The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the
sense that:

(a)  Deemed Authority

The law provides for a form of execution which, if followed, entitles a party 
to
presume that the company is bound.  In Japan, this involves the execution of a
contract by the company's "representative director".  This corresponds to the
presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the 
US
and in the UK, and the execution of the contract by 2 directors in Australia.

It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted 
by
law or the constituent documents of the corporation. (Article 53 of the Civil
Code) but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction, the contract 
is
still binding on the company.

(b)  Apparent Authority

In common, with other countries, Japan has a concept of apparent authority.
Article 262 of the Commercial Code provides:

 "A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done
by a director invested with any title such as president, vice president,
executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he 
has
authority to represent the company, even in cases where the person has no 
power
of representation."

Articles 37 and 38 of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to "general
managers" (so shihainin).  It is generally considered that Article 43 then
applies the concept to "an employee who has been entrusted with certain types 
of
matters or specific matters."

Accordingly, in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article 262
(above), the general view is that persons having titles such as general 
manager
and division manager (bucho), will be deemed to have the authority to 
represent
the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the 
company's
business for which they are responsible.

It is also likely that section managers (kacho) or section chiefs (kakaricho)
have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are
responsible.

(e)  Holding Out

Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority, if
the company has held the employee out as having authority, the company will be
bound by his/her action.

5.  Practical Considerations

In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law, 
the
following factors are relevant:

(a)  Practice regarding Representative Director Seal

It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the 
presumption
referred to in 4(a) above by requiring the representative director's corporate
seal to be affixed (and, if contract is in English, for him to sign) or  to
insist on tracing the "chain of authority" of the signatory up to the
representative director (e.g. by power of attorney), for major or unusual
transactions.

(b)  Size of Transaction

The question is what transactions fall into the "major" or "unusual" category.

Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn.  As in
many other countries, the answer depends on factors such as those noted in 
(c),
(d) and (e) below, which vary company by company.

Accordingly, where the contract involves (or could involve) a considerable
ongoing exposure by the company, Japanese corporations would not be surprised 
to
be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level, or for written 
confirmation
of the signatory's authority to be obtained from a person at such level.

(c)  Size of Company

While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative
director's seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case 
of a
smaller company, it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a
major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty, in which
companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority.

(d)  Business Department of Signatory

The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority
doctrine if the signatory is in (and carries a title which refers to) the
relevant business department (e.g. energy), than if he is not.

(e)  Degree of Exposure

To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to 
expose
the counterparty to considerable liability, the possibility of a counterparty 
in
the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a
reasonably conservative approach.

(f)  Recent History

However, even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic
crisis, Japanese companies (at least major companies) have not generally
attempted to use lack of authority as a defense, presumably because of
reputation considerations.

(g) Identity of Addressee

The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant.
For example, if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department,
but the application came from a section chief, there would be strong argument
that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary
authority.

(h)  Internal Procedures

Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be
considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in
some countries, and by two directors in for example Australia, the Japanese
rules are not out of line with those of other countries.

Accordingly, it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent 
approach
to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other
countries.  The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for
Japan as well, although some adjustment will need to be made for Japan's 
unique
regime of company titles.

6.  Conservative Approach

If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for 
the
counter-party, under common practice Enron would require:

* The application to be executed under the registered seal of (and counter
signed by) a representative director, or by a person who is able to produce
documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative
director.

* A certified copy of the seal register.

* A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal
Affairs Bureau, to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the
representative director.

7.  Less Conservative Approach

Major Companies

For major Japanese trading companies, banks, insurance companies and other
companies of equivalent size, the following approach could be adopted which
would not be out of line with market practice:

* The application to be executed by a manager (or general manager)(bucho)
of the relevant department or above, or

* By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party.

A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a
person at the level of section manager (kacho) or section chief (kakaricho), 
but
this is right "on the line" and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there 
is
some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an
apparent authority argument.

Smaller Companies

For other companies the approach would be as set out in 6. above.

Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for
dividing between small and large companies.

8.  Likely Response of Target  Companies

Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view 
but,
taking into account Japanese commercial practice, we do not believe any 
company
is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an
application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach,
particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with 
the
correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no
applications have yet been approved.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a "physical" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

Subject: Enron Online Japan - Tax Issues =20

I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their=
=20
final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese=
=20
trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a=20
summary of their advice:

A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions
1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions

Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard=20
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment=
=20
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that=
=20
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imput=
ed=20
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding ta=
x.

2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes

Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions a=
re=20
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative=20
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan=20
imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are t=
he=20
subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such=
=20
excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and=
=20
delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely=20
financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices.

3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions

If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in=20
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific=20
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an=20
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and=
=20
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local=20
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.

B. Physically Settled Transactions
1. Consumption Tax

Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods an=
d=20
on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicab=
le=20
to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online websit=
e,=20
including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and=20
paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should=20
provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the=20
Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-base=
d=20
customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that=20
capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax a=
nd=20
then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.=20

If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such=20
commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be=20
required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay=20
consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such a=
n=20
arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered=20
resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption=
=20
tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer.

2. Excise Tax

Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various=20
commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum=
=20
products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon=
=20
the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including=20
coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a=20
petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject t=
o=20
excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities=
=20
before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer a=
nd=20
has responsibility for payment of excise taxes.

C. Tax Representations

The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,=20
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in=
=20
force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs=20
entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee=20
representations may provide that:

(1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not appl=
y=20
and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and
(2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron=20
entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article=
=20
of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in=
=20
the paying Enron entity=01,s jurisdiction. =20


Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional informati=
on=20
or would like me to forward our outside advisor=01,s memo on this subject t=
o you.

Best regards,
Susan

Frank -

There appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address (my fault,
not yours) and I have just now seen your note from yesterday morning.  I am
working on the Posting Agreement.  I'm afraid Louise may have thought more
highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than
I deserved but we will try and get that to you soon.  Travis McCullough,
our corporate lawyer, will get together a term sheet on the equity side of
things which we should be able to get to you quickly (no later than
Thursday if his schedule permits).  I'm assuming that your legal team will
have to be draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term
sheet should give them a good starting point (and let you confirm that the
lawyers on both sides are getting it right).

Sorry for the delay and confusion - we'll get these out to you as soon as
we can.

Mark

Dave, attached is our settled form of product description and GTC we have 
prepared for a HDD Australian weather swap. The GTC has been prepared on the 
basis that the GTCs will apply even in instances where there is a Master 
Agreement with the counterparty.     

Susan/Heidi - I  would also like a specific sign off from someone (presumably 
Price WaterhouseCoopers) that the input tax status of commodity derivatives 
(as outlined in the Australian Tax Office Consultation Paper on the 
application of GST to financial services) will extend to weather derivatives.

We are preparing similar documentation for the following, HDD swap, HDD Call 
Option, HDD Put Option, CDD Swap, CDD Call Option and CDD Put Option.

Interested in any feedback.

Subject: Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ISDA

Hi Carol,

Peter has asked me to respond to your inquiry as to whether or not we can=
=20
agree to the request of Weyerhaeuser Company Limited ("WCL") in order to=20
replace the existing securities representations (as found near the bottom o=
f=20
this e-mail) in the ISDA to:

"It is a Qualified Party within the meaning of the Ontario Securities=20
Commission, Rule 91-505 Over-the-Counter Derivatives."

>From my perspective, there are four main reasons why this amendment would n=
ot=20
be appropriate.  They are as follows:

1.  Proposed Rule 91-504 - Over-The-Counter Derivatives ("91-504") and the=
=20
corresponding companion policy have yet to be formally adopted.  At this=20
time, 91-504 is merely a proposal.  In addition to checking the Ontario=20
Securities Commission ("OSC") website, I have contacted the lawyer who firs=
t=20
brought the "securities representation" issue to our attention and he has=
=20
confirmed that 91-504 is not yet in place and there have been no recent=20
announcements by the OSC with respect to an anticipated timeline for such=
=20
adoption.

2.  Even though the WCL may trade through an office in Toronto, any trade=
=20
with Enron Canada Corp. ("Enron Canada") is likely to be considered a "trad=
e=20
within Alberta" under Alberta securities law (due to the fact that the head=
=20
office and the mind and management of Enron Canada are in Alberta).  As a=
=20
result, it is important that we get representations which address Alberta=
=20
securities law.

3.  In a similar vein to point number 2 above, a "trade" can take place in =
a=20
number of jurisdictions depending upon the particular facts of the trade. =
=20
Although it may seem unlikely, it is possible that trades could possibly be=
=20
made in jurisdictions other than Alberta and Ontario.  With the exception o=
f=20
British Columbia, I am not aware of other provinces of Canada adopting=20
similar "blanket orders", "policies" or "rules" with respect to this issue.=
 =20
However, it is usually Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia which are at t=
he=20
forefront of Canadian securities law development (with the remaining=20
jurisdictions eventually following the leaders).   I expect that, once 91-5=
04=20
is in place, we will see some movement from the remaining jurisdictions. =
=20
Regardless, it would seem prudent to leave the reference to British Columbi=
a=20
in place at this time.

4.  I think it is worthwhile to have the parties to the ISDA acknowledge th=
e=20
fact that a transaction under the ISDA will constitute an "OTC Derivative"=
=20
(and thus, have the applicable prospectus and registration exemptions=20
potentially available to them).  I can think of no reason why it would be=
=20
beneficial to either party to remove this representation.

With respect to our physical agreements, we have addressed points 1, 2 and =
3=20
above (as well as the fact that the exemptions we are relying upon are=20
provided by blanket orders and policies {as opposed to the Securities Act=
=20
(Alberta), Securities Act (British Columbia) or Securities Act (Ontario)} a=
nd=20
are, thus, more likely to be {and more easily} amended) with the following=
=20
clause:

"(i) each Transaction shall constitute a =01&commodity contract=018 or an =
=01&OTC=20
derivative=018 or such other similar term as defined pursuant to the securi=
ties=20
legislation in force in Alberta or British Columbia or pursuant to the=20
securities legislation of any other jurisdictions having application to the=
=20
Transaction, and (ii) it is a =01&Qualified Party=018 within the meaning of=
=20
paragraph 9.1 of Alberta Securities Commission Order Doc.#394043 and=20
paragraph 1.1 of the British Columbia Securities Commission Blanket Order=
=20
BOR#91-501, in either case, as amended, restated, replaced or re-enacted fr=
om=20
time to time, and pursuant to any equivalent order or other enactment made=
=20
pursuant to the securities laws of Alberta, British Columbia or any other=
=20
jurisdictions having application to the Transaction;"

I understand that similar language has not been adopted in the ISDA due to=
=20
the "open-ended" nature of the above-mentioned clause.  If we want to refer=
=20
to 91-504 and only to the blanket orders and policies currently in place, I=
=20
would suggest that we amend the existing clause, which states:

Canadian Securities Acts.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an =01&OTC=
=20
Derivative=018 as defined in the Securities Act (Alberta) and the Securitie=
s Act=20
(British Columbia) which have application to such Transaction and (ii) it i=

to:

Canadian Securities Legislation.  (i) Each Transaction shall constitute an=

of=20
paragraph 1.1 of [Proposed] OSC 91-504.

Once 91-504 is formally adopted by the OSC, the bold and square bracketed=
=20
language above should be deleted and you may want to amend the ISDAs which=
=20
were drafted using such language.   Similarly, if there are amendments to t=

or British Columbia) which could possibly have/claim some jurisdiction with=

may want to amend the clause (and possibly, the pre-existing ISDAs).

I hope this discussion is useful for you.  If you have any questions, pleas=

Group - we need to address the due diligence for executing the " first " 
physical option transactions in Brasil and for Direct Sales ( and Wholesale 
).  The initial industrial candidates are: 

Owens Corning ( 1.6MWs firm ). 1 site,  peaking unit.  break-even R$182/MW - 
5 year term
Carbocloro ( 10 MWs firm ). 1 site 3rd part re-sale(Copel) , monthly call 
option. supplanting product sales, estimate minimum incentive strike R$ 
125/MW  - 3 or 4 year term,  
O Globo. (1-3MWs) 2 sites, peaking units.  awaiting summary terms and 
conditions. 
White Martins (10-15MWs ).   8 sites (MG), intersite flexibility to adjust 
product between sites and maximize energy re-sale.  3rd party re-sale 
(Cemig). short-term capacity basis indutrial demand for gases short-term 
variable price - 2 or 3 year

In all four cases, Enron is buying the right to buy power and all 3 are 
executable in Q2/Q3.  We are expecting (hoping) to transact paying no premium 
- with the focus on the strike price itself being the profitability incentive 
to the customer.  However, we'll need to guage our pricing ability ( and 
appetite from a book and risk control point of view ) for option length and 
the forward curve, not to mention getting the terms and conditions into 
reasonably standardized and legally binding contracts.  

Wholesale. Am including Wholesale on the wire given both the synergies on 
contracting and pricing and given the significant potential ( benefit and 
opportunity to Enron's regional trading effort ) to launch the physical and 
financial option product line into the commercial Wholesale effort.  

Note:  Particularly to put options - how many LDCs would we expect to charge 
us anything for our right to sell them power at R$30 or R$40/MWh ( or have 
charged us  3-5 months ago for the right to sell closer to R$50-60.  

We're having first sit down with Remi and Sami this afternoon, Wed Apr 19; 
please shoot any/all additional inputs, insights.

The above counterparty has requested the following changes to the ETA:

1. Make the reps in section 2(d) reciprocal

2. Make the assignment provision in Section 6(b) reciprocal

3. In Section 6(c), insert the word "its" between the words "all" and "third".

Please advise.

1. Products

We confirm we do not consider it necessary for Enron to block Japanese users
from dealing any of the products we understand are contemplated.

2. Customers

Regarding the gambling issue, there is no problem in dealings with banks and
insurance and securities companies because of the provisions in the relevant
industry  laws.

With respect to other companies, there is a potential issue, the risk being 
less
with companies of the type Enron has targeted in the First Wave of mailings, 
and
greater if you respond to approaches from individuals or small companies.

We suggest that Enron take a reasonably conservative approach and seek to
minimize the risk by:

- including in the contract representations of the type discussed

- the credit check process being used to exclude individuals, smaller 
companies
and any other organization which appears not to meet the legitimate business
test

- possibly including a risk disclosure statement in the documentation (we have
not had the chance to confirm if it contains one already).

4.  Commodities Exchange Law

Noting that kerosene for example is a product traded on a Japanese commodities
exchange, we reconfirm that we do not see any problem in the online proposal
insofar as it does not use prices quoted on the Japanese market.

>From the facility viewpoint, we confirm our view that so long as Enron Japan
does not become actively involved in the business, the proposal will not
constitute a commodities facility in Japan.

5.  Counter party risks

Your credit or other control procedures will need to take account of:

(a) whether the transactions fall into the counter-party's business purposes, 
in
the case of counter-parties other than banks and insurance companies and
securities companies.  In this respect, non-companies and "statutory
corporations" need to be dealt with particularly carefully.  The Japanese 
legal
position is somewhat complicated and we would be happy to advise you further.

(b) the need for proper authorization and execution,  particularly of the
initial application or terms and conditions.

(c)  netting - the situation differs between counterparties who are financial
institutions and those who are not.

(d)  foreign exchange - for non-banks, ex post facto reporting will be 
required,
depending upon the size of the transaction.  This obligation falls upon the
customer, not Enron, and failure to report will not affect the validity of the
transaction, but Enron should consider whether to inform customers of that 
this
need may exist.

6.  Other

We suggest that you/we closely monitor any changes to the role of EJ/EJM or
changes in the structure of the online transactions

We look forward in due course to receiving your instructions to commencing
preparations for the moving of some of the functions onshore.

Regards

Cort:

I have reviewed the Mutual Assistance Agreement and am not entirely 
comfortable that it establishes the authority of GPU Services Company to 
enter into power transactions on behalf of the utilities.  The Agreement 
provides in Section 3 that "each Company . . . will furnish to such other 
Company  . . . one or more of the Goods . . ." and that "[a]ll Goods provided 
hereunder shall be priced at cost . . ."  Thus, the Agreement provides that 
the Service Company can buy power and sell it to a utility at cost.  It does 
not expressly provide that the Service Company can act as agent on behalf of 
the utilities in purchasing or selling power on their behalf.

I wanted to confirm that there was no other documentation available that more 
clearly identified the authority of GPU Services to act as agent on behalf of 
the utilities.  In the absence of such documentation, I propose language to 
add to the Electronic Trading Agreement to address my concerns.  I would also 
like to have each of the utilities sign a short acknowledgment form 
acknowledging the authority of GPU Service Company to enter into transactions 
with EPMI on its behalf.   Attached below please find my proposed revisions 
to the Letter Agreement amending the ETA (which was originally forwarded to 
you by Carol St. Clair) as well as the proposed Acknowledgment.



I look forward to discussing any questions or comments you may have.

Leslie: The Mutual Assistance Agreement that was sent to you was filed with 
the
Pa PUC . I'll check but I believe the filing to which you are referring was
originally filed with the SEC back in the early 1970's and has since been
amended a number of times.  Obviously as a part of a holding company structure
GPU Service is required to have SEC approval to provide services to our
operating companies. The GPU Service corporate records are not located here in
Reading, PA....do you really need the SEC document? Cort

As I understand it, Section 13(b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
requires registered holding companies to obtain approval from the SEC in order
to form a service company to provide services to its affiliates in the system.
I have reviewed the Mutual Assistance Agreement that John faxed to me earlier.
Is this the Agreement which was filed by General Public Utilities Corporation

I agree that the current Word document approval form will not be very 
practical once we scale up. Going forward, we could be looking at some kind 
of database solution as implemented for EnronOnline.

Although this makes a lot of sense, how are going to implement it?  We plan

facilitate the time frames and number of reference credits that we are 
anticipating.  I think that we need to have a general policy that we can look

Following our recent discussions, I wanted to provide more information about 
how we would plan to administer the contest around Euro 2000.  We would 
restrict access to the contest to participants in countries that we have 
cleared.  The likely way that this will work will be to restrict access at 
the point of registration for the contest.  Here's how I think it would look 
to the user:

There would be a Euro 2000 icon on the EnronOnline quotes screen (the main 
page of our system).
The user would click on this icon, and a new browser window would open with 
the EnronOnline/Sports.com home page.  This will contain schedules, results, 
player profiles, etc.  It will also contain an icon for Minute Mania Contest.
When the user clicks on this icon, they would then go to a page that 
describes at a high level what the contest is.  Pick times for events (first 
goal, etc) and win prizes (digital video camera, etc).   We would also note 
here that the contest is only open to residents of UK, Germany, etc.  Click 
here to register.  
The user will then go to a screen that has several input boxes that include:  
Name, contact details (email, phone), user name for contest, and country of 
residence.  The country of residence box would either be a drop down that 
only includes choices for the countries that are eligible or would allow the 
user to type their country.  If the user has the ability to type their 
country then the system would then have a verification process that rejects 
those that are ineligible to participate.

The order of priority for the countries where we have users is:

UK
Germany
Belgium
Netherlands
Switzerland
Norway
Sweden
Finland
Denmark
Austria
Italy
Spain
France

Then there is also

US (largest customer base) -  state by state differences 
Canada (second largest group)
Australia
Japan

We also have users with guest ID's in Poland, Portugal, and Singapore. (we 
should confirm the laws here as well)

Please let me know if I can provide any further details.

thanks
Dave

Dear Felipe

Nice to hear that the register.com deal is going through.  Again, here are 
the domains that we need for EnronOnline.  (So, enrononline.co.jp, 
enrononline.com.sg, etc.)

As I mentioned to you, let's try to get all of the unrestricted domains 
immediately and all of the information fro the restricted domains as soon as 
possible.  The first tier is of course a higher priority, but I recognize 
that we may be able to get some of the second tier domains faster, if they 
are unrestricted.

As you contact register.com, you should tell them that we want all restricted 
domains ASAP and that we want all of the information and materials necessary 
to register the unrestricted domains.  As a precaution, I would tell them 
that they should not register unrestricted domains for us without our consent 
(Dave Forster's approval), simply because, as in the case of Japan, we don't 
want to take another Enron business unit's one domain, if the country's rule 
is 'one domain name per company'.  (Presumably they wouldn't be able to do 
that any way, because we'd have to provide them with that information, but 
just in case!)

For now (unless Dave Forster objects), let's use my London RC code (because 
as the deal stands, it's an Enron Europe company signing the contract with 
register.com).  It is RC 100487.

Thank you very much Felipe!

Jay

PS Mark & Justin, I thought you'd like to know about this, just in case there 
are any legal/tax issues that we should be aware of!

Rahil,

Would it be ok if we executed this NDA as mutual? Our lawyer has
provided a redlined copy with the changes that would make it mutual.
Otherwise, we don't have an issue with it.

Let me know if there's a problem.

agreement.  The equity desk uses the services of POSIT which is an electronic 
trading system which matches orders six times daily for institutions and 
broker dealers.  There is no agreement for this matching service.  I am not

1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is 
part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't 
sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.

2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their 
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own 
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I 
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided 
nature of the indemnity language.

Couple of questions:

- What is the intention of the first paragraph?
- So, does Paragraph 4 roughly translate to: "Counterparty is allowed to 
whack us if we don't have high enough security"?

now that we are officially behind a chinese wall can this process be 
reevaluated?  I think that it will be increasingly difficult to scale at the 
pace we need to over the coming months if we can not design an automated 
process.  Are we trying to avoid actually misusing confidential information 
or the perception of misusing the information?  our intent is to begin to 
scale on a massive level from now until we have reached over a million 
reference credits.

Bryan -

The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General 
Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.  Several of them 
then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations.  
Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at 
once instead of piecemeal.  What do you think?

Attached is a draft of the Agreement we discussed.  The draft assumes that 
Enron will enter into an access agreement (or similar type of agreement) with 
the Sponsor or Platform and that this agreement will supplement (and, where 
necessary, supersede, the access agreement).  I think this is probably a 
valid assumption, because Enron will have to be a participant on the system 
on which it posts prices and the systems generally require all participants 
to sign a uniform form of agreement.

Feel free to call after you have had a chance to review it.  Thanks.

Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above 
counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA 
is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: EnronOnline

Justin - 

David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to 
get people to use EnronOnline.  They want to set up a sports fantasy league 
system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding 
prizes to the winners.  The first proposal relates to European football (I 
think) and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 10:00 a.m. Houston 
time Tuesday.  Any chance you might be available to listen in?

Subject: Re: Follow-up on Friday's meeting  

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a 
good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document is 
in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal wider 
than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a 
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with 
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the 
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to 
introduce financial transactions?



Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is 
email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early 
next week to go through the draft.

Regards

Louise

Subject: Follow-up on Friday's meeting


Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate individuals
on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
try to push this forward this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from
HoustonStreet.

Best regards,
Frank Getman

I think that the "general policies" route is the right (and only) one - 
particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged.  From a 
legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all 
clear, provided
in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty 
of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc).  
We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not 
per se a legal task)
in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location
in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal 
due diligence in its country of establishment/location

Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in 
the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as 
generically as possible.  

Hope this gives a sense of where we're coming from.  Please call me to 
discuss further if need be.

Paul

Although this makes a lot of sense, how are going to implement it?  We plan 
to scale massively and I cannot imagine that this will be efficient enough to 
facilitate the time frames and number of reference credits that we are 
anticipating.  I think that we need to have a general policy that we can look 
to instead of approving them on a one off basis.

Let's discuss

Subject: ECTRIC - application to become a Proprietary trader on the OMLX in 
order to trade the Pulpex Market

Bob / Steve,

This is to inform you that, at last, I heard from the OMLX yesterday 
afternoon that they have signed the documentation for ECTRIC's Prop trader 
membership of the OMLX.  Please note that this does not mean at this stage 
that ECTRIC is a trading member of the Exchange as this is dependant on the 
following:

1. The OMLX are sending back to me the Clearing Agreement and one other 
document which require the signature of  our clearer, E.D.&F Man 
International Ltd in London.  (Apparently, although the OMLX has signed them, 
they require us to forward them to Man rather than for them to do this!!!!).  
Once Man's have signed them, then I shall need to file them with the OMLX 
once again.

Accordingly, please let me have:

(i) details of our contact at E.D.&F Man International Ltd in London; and

(ii) his/her telephone number so that I can speak to them and then arrange 
for these documents to be sent to them.

2. Steve needs to arrange  to take his SFA examination.  Once passed, he 
needs to let me (and Lin Richardson) know.  Under the OMLX's application 
procedure, I shall then need to write to the Exchange to let them know 
formally that Steve will be EEFT's trader and that he has passed his SFA 
exams.

Only once 1 and 2 have been completed will ECTRIC be admitted as a Prop 
trading member of the Exchange.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Mark

Mark -- Enron Corp. is working on a new corporate profile and would like to 
include the following case study about EOL.  It is similar to the version 
printed in the Annual Report.  However, this version is shorter.  Could you 
give approval?  Since Louise is in Japan, I'll get her approval next week.

We have had many requests for a copy of the roster from the class you
recently attended.  Clearly, that is a positive sign that the networking
part of our objectives in holding these sessions is working.   Attached is
the roster from your group.  We encourage you to contact these individuals
as you move forward in your careers at Enron.  You have a significant
"shared experience" and I am sure they would be willing to be of assistance
to you in any way they can.

Thanks again for your active participation in the program.  You had a major
part in making it the success that it was.   I will be contacting you in
the next few months to follow up and get some feedback from you about the
program.  In the interim, let me know if there is anything else I can do to
be of help in furthering your executive development.

I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our 
exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with 
this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around 
this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online.

Dave, attached is our settled form of product description and GTC we have 
prepared for a HDD Australian weather swap. The GTC has been prepared on the 
basis that the GTCs will apply even in instances where there is a Master 
Agreement with the counterparty.     

Susan/Heidi - I  would also like a specific sign off from someone (presumably 
Price WaterhouseCoopers) that the input tax status of commodity derivatives 
(as outlined in the Australian Tax Office Consultation Paper on the 
application of GST to financial services) will extend to weather derivatives.

We are preparing similar documentation for the following, HDD swap, HDD Call 
Option, HDD Put Option, CDD Swap, CDD Call Option and CDD Put Option.

Interested in any feedback.

Subject: Language for the Confirmation

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by the Counterparty of the Fixed Amount will be treated as a payment 
pursuant to a guaranty by the Counterparty of the obligations of Bob West 
Treasure, LLC to make payments under a Loan Agreement between Bob West 
Treasure, LLC and Royal Bank of Canada.  The parties agree that to the extent 
either of the parties is required to report any item of income, gain, loss, 
deduction or credit relating to the Transaction for United States federal 
income tax purposes, such party shall report such item consistent with the 
characterization set forth above and shall not take any position on any tax 
return or report relating to United States federal income taxes which is 
inconsistent with such characterization.  The parties recognize that the 
manner in which they have agreed to characterize the Transaction for United 
States federal income tax purposes may be inconsistent with the manner in 
which the Transaction is characterized for non-United States federal income 
tax purposes and for accounting, regulatory or other purposes.  The 
provisions of this Section are not intended to affect the manner in which the 
parties report the Transaction for such other purposes, or the interpretation 
of the provisions of the Confirmation and the rights and obligations of the 
Parties arising hereunder, for any purposes.

Although this makes a lot of sense, how are going to implement it?  We plan 
to scale massively and I cannot imagine that this will be efficient enough to 
facilitate the time frames and number of reference credits that we are 
anticipating.  I think that we need to have a general policy that we can look 
to instead of approving them on a one off basis.

Let's discuss

Alan/Nick

Please see the attached note which sets out our preliminary analysis of the
regulatory aspects of the proposed Enron Online business.

In due course, bringing the trading activities onshore into Japan is going to
force us to bring some of the regulations into more immediate focus.  At the
moment (apart from the potential p/e problem which Ed is advising on), the 
task
is more to decide:

(a)  how essential is it to preserve the "extra territoriality" second line of
defense; and if it is important,

(b) how far can Enron Japan become involved in the offshore activities without
prejudicing that defense.

I suggest we can regroup on this after Golden Week.

Regards

Paul

Mark,

I work for Edward Ondarza as an originator in the Pulp and Paper group.  We 
are attempting to close a major asset financing transaction that required 
Enron to execute several swaptions with large buyers of paper packaging.  
Through this process, we signed on 5 new major counter-parties:

Quaker Oats (Shari)
Frito-Lay/Pepsi (Shari)
Ralcorp Holdings (Shari)
General Mills (Sara)
Kellogg's (Sara)

In addition, Sara helped negotiate a complex swaption with The Dial 
Corporation.  As we move to mid-year performance reviews, I wanted to cite 
these individuals for great work in helping us win new business.  Please let 
me know if you have any questions at ext. 30418.

Thanks.

Ed Quinn

best for you and what didn't work.   I will keep whatever you say

you have made in the last year.  Could you also give that some thought and

Just to give a head's up,

In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, 
Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents 
for her group.  The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy 
Zipper, Vice President.  FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows 
certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of 
EnronOnline.

Subject: Re: Follow-up on Friday's meeting  

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a 
good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document is 
in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal wider 
than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a 
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with 
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the 
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to 
introduce financial transactions?



Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is 
email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early 
next week to go through the draft.

Regards

Louise

Subject: Follow-up on Friday's meeting


Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate individuals
on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
try to push this forward this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from
HoustonStreet.

Best regards,
Frank Getman

As long as our omission by way of (for example) not having high enough 
security is not enough to impact the liability clause, then I guess I am OK 
with this - but I'd be happier if it did not include "omission"

i.e. If we are stupid and hurt ourselves, then shame on us, but if we simply 
do not take some action and thereby fail to prevent the Counterparty from 
inflicting damage on us, then that is something different.

Thoughts?

Dave

Dave:
1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is 
part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't 
sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.

2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their 
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own 
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I 
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided 
nature of the indemnity language.

Couple of questions:

- What is the intention of the first paragraph?
- So, does Paragraph 4 roughly translate to: "Counterparty is allowed to 
whack us if we don't have high enough security"?

Subject: Enron online/sports.com competition


Dear Justin

You asked for a summary of the UK and foreign advice which we have collated
on the lawfulness of the Enron online/sports.com "spread betting"
competition. I have set out a short note below. Marly and I would be happy
to discuss it with you further by telephone at any time this afternoon.

I have assumed that the competition is based predominantly on chance. I have
also assumed that there is no element of indirect consideration required to
enter the competition. We may need to discuss these points in more detail.

UK:

There appears to be no problem. The competition cannot be a lottery as the
contestants do not pay to enter. The competition may fall within the
definition of gaming, but only unlawful gaming is prohibited. The
competition format which you have described is unlikely be an unlawful game.

Germany:

There appears to be no problem as far as gaming laws on lotteries and the
German Trading Regulations are concerned, because the participants will not
pay to enter the competition. However, it is possible that there may a
breach of unfair competition laws. One of Enron's customers without online
trading capacity or one of Enron's competitors could argue that the
competition is anti-competitive i.e. Enron is trying to influence the
decision of its online trading customers as to whether they should trade
with Enron at all. We should consider this risk in greater detail. If the
game was held to be anti-competitive, Enron would have to cease to offer it
to German customers.

Netherlands:

Under the Dutch Games of Chance Act (GCA), games of chance are generally
prohibited, even if participation is free.  However, we have been advised
that, to date, it is not clear whether the GCA even applies to internet
games. We have also been advised that, in any event, the Dutch authorities
are unlikely to consider it a high priority to try to enforce the GCA
against a game offered for a limited time with only a moderate prize.
Finally, we have been advised that if the game complies with the law in the
country of its origin, this would decrease the likelihood of any Dutch
action. Thus the key decision in the Netherlands is whether the commercial
benefits of the competition outweighs the risk of a fine for contravention
of the GCA - maximum NLG 25,000 (approx 10,000 USD).

The GCA also only applies to games of chance. The provisions of the act
could be avoided if a greater degree of skill was introduced in to the
competition.

Italy:

You may recall that under Italian law, it appears that Enron will need to
get the approval of the Italian Ministry of Finance to offer the game to
Italian customers as it falls within the definition of an "advertising
contest". Having discussed this matter with our Italian colleagues, it seems
that Enron will be unable to avoid this requirement unless it does not offer
prizes. Authorisation is likely to take a minimum of 30 days - there is no
fast track process. Furthermore, since the website will be co-branded Enron
online/sports.com, we have been advised that both parties would need to seek
authorisation. Failure to obtain authorisation may result in a fine of up to
15m Lire (approx 7,500 USD) and continuing an unauthorised game in
contravention of an order of the Ministry of Finance may result in a fine of
up to 100m Lire (approx 50,000 USD).

We have also been advised that the Italian Ministry of Finance does not
undertake regular or thorough searches of the internet to identify
potentially unlawful advertising contests. With this is mind, Enron may
consider that the commercial benefits of running the competition in Italy
outweighs the risk of being fined. We may need to consider this issue in
more detail.

Belgium:

The advice we received from our Belgian colleague is inconclusive. The game
does not fall foul of the new Law on Games of Chance as no entry fee is
charged. However, we have been advised that there is a small risk that the
game may be prohibited under the Law on Lotteries of 1851 since it is a game
of chance. This risk can be alleviated by limiting the access to the game to
defined group of users - as is the case here - and by increasing the level
of skill involved. We may need to consider this risk in more detail since
civil and criminal sanctions may be imposed on the organisers of a
non-authorised lottery - imprisonment for up to 3 months and a fine of up to
BEF 600,000 (approx 14,000 USD) for the organiser of the competition (Enron)
as well as a fine for the distributor (sports.com) of up to BEF 200,000
(approx 4,500 USD)

Switzerland:

There appears to be no problem under Swiss law as the contestants do not
need to pay to participate.

As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have 
the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there 
was any.  Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but 
after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.  We need 
to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of 
the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global 
Contract and the online crew.

Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.  Thanks.

I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's
comments.  I see no problems except:

1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the"United
Kingdom."   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say
"England," as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g.,
Scottish) within the U.K.

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

Mark

As mentioned at our trading meeting on Tuesday, we are putting together a 
tailored ISDA schedule for our banking counterparties with which we propose 
to trade credit transactions.

One issue we have revisited is whether the definition of Specified 
Indebtedness (which ties into the cross default provisions) should be 
expanded to cover derivatives transactions as well as the more conventional 
bank borrowings.  

We think there are arguments both ways on this, but wonder whether we have a 
"house view".  Since the definition is not expanded in our standard ISDA 
schedule, we assume that our preferred position is to exclude derivatives 
transactions from the cross default provisions of the ISDA.

Perhaps we can discuss this when you have a spare moment! Thanks

Kind regards.

Paul

Greetings to you both!  It has been awhile since we last spoke.  I would like 
to
finalize the matrix which we have been discussing since the latter part of 
1999.
Although we were awaiting new Central Bank regulations, I am beginning to 
think
that the Central Bank revisions will not impact the matrix except with respect
to transactions which may be entered into by entities that are the subject of
the Central Bank regulations.  Please let me know whether or not you agree or
can offer any suggestions.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

Thanks you for your time yesterday.  It helped us quite as we are in the 
process of shaping the business opportunity.

Can you please send me some info (a memo or whatever you might have) that 
gives a high level understanding of the regulatory environment in the US for 
credit derivatives.  In particular, I would like to capture any issues that 
would affect the economics of the business opportunity.  

Can you also please give me the name of an attorney that could provide me 
with information on regulatory requirements for insurance-related businesses.

Thanks.

Gillian Johnson
