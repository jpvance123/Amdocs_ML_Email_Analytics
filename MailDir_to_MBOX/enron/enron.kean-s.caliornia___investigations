Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess; that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.

Other info from the conversation:
With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that "they're making it up as they go."
Any vote on fines, etc. would only a require a simple majority to pass.

Lockyer writes a very belated letter to the LA Times---"regret" of the slimy variety:

My comment about introducing an energy company executive to the ugly reality of a prison cell was repeated recently by columnist Peter King (June 10) and has become fodder for commentaries that suggest I might think that prison rape is proper punishment for criminals. 
My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. As attorney general I significantly reordered my department's priorities in order to complete the DNA offender database this year. I also sponsored new laws to help fight rape crimes. My office prosecuted prison guards charged with encouraging inmate rapes at Corcoran State Prison. 
I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of Californians. I should have made my point--that even the most powerful corporate executives are not beyond the law--without the crude remark.

Folks,  since many law firms have failed to exit the dark ages, they continue to use wordperfect.  To open this, don't launch.  Instead, "detach."  Then open the file that you've "detached" and it should convert from WP to word and you should be able to open it.

Best,
Jeff

Dan Douglass has drafted joint comments for two coalitions in which Enron is 
a member -- Alliance for Retail Energy Markets and Western Power Trading 
Forum.  Robert, feel free to contact Dan directly with your comments.  Let me 
know your thoughts as well.  I am out of the office at a WPTF meeting. Dan is 
here as well. If you need to contact me, you can leave me a message on my 
office phone or try my cell (415 -- 902-4108), but I'm not sure the cell is 
working all the time.

		 Subject: Comments on Draft Decisions Regarding PX Credit and Direct Access



Attached for your review and comment is my first draft of comments to be  
filed on Monday with regard to the draft decisions of ALJ Barnett and  
Commissioner Bilas.? Please review it carefully, as I have thrown in  
everything I can think of on a rush basis, and it may require some 
significant  editing.? Pay particular attention to Section V dealing with 
Bilas' request  for parties to discuss alternatives to DA suspension.? The 
draft offers a  compromise to the DWR's concerns, as expressed in the 
Angelides memo.?  Also, notice that Section VI urges the Commission to 
bifurcate the DA and PX  credit issues, acting quickly on the first, if it 
must, but more leisurely on  the PX credit subject.
?
Finally, I have a suggestion?in the form of a question.? How  would AReM 
members feel about making this a joint filing with WPTF?? There  is 
cross-membership between the two groups and the same issues would be raised  
in the separate filings which I am otherwise prepared to draft.? This draft  
would requires some modifications so as to refer to the "Joint Parties" as  
opposed to solely mentioning AReM, and I might? add a section dealing more  
explicitly with WPTF's contribution to getting the zero minimum bill 
stipulation  signed in the first place.? Otherwise, the document would stay 
much as it  is (subject to your input over the next few days, of course).? 
Please let  me know what you think asap, as I am already working on a WPTF 
draft.?  Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which 
will  support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not 
proposing  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.? Thanks for your help!?  
Comments as soon as possible would be very much appreciated!

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?=09Multiple MOU Plans Debated
?=09California State Budget Faces One Last Hurdle

Budget=20
There is a small possibility that Sen. Burton will not recess the Senate on=
 Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last=
 night (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in It=
aly and is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told to=
 return and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed to =
pass any urgency measure for the budget.  Kuehl's vote is crucial if they t=
ake the bill up on Thursday.=20
MOU Mayhem
There are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by the Calif=
ornia House and Senate deliberations.  Senator Burton is hoping to keep the=
 published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening.  =
Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison =
issue is resolved.  However, rumor is that whether or not they recess on Th=
ursday, their adjournment will mark the end of the Second Extraordinary ses=
sion and all XX  bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days (al=
l others will be dead).  Although Davis has stressed the urgency of passing=
 a comprehensive "bail-out" plan and even threatened to call an emergency s=
ession to prevent legislators from taking a 30-day recess on Friday, there =
is no clear indication that legislators will comply with this request.     =
=20
?=09Hertzberg's bill 82XX - Of the more obvious differences from Davis MOU,=
  82XX proposes to offer SoCal $300 M less for its transmission lines in ad=
dition to penalizing Edison if it fails to act in good faith in closing the=
 deal.  It comes as no surprise that during bill deliberations, SoCal raise=
d objections to the bill and warned of impending difficulties (bankruptcy) =
for So Cal were the bill left unamended.
?=09The Wright-Richman bill 83XX - We reported last week that 83XX remains =
the only measure fueled by bipartisan support.  AB 83XX was heard in an "in=
formational" hearing yesterday (7-17) and will be heard again today in the =
Assembly Energy Committee.  Assemblyman Rod Wright, the Chairman of the Com=
mittee, presented AB 83xx with Dr. Keith Richman, a Republican Assemblyman =
from Southern California. They offered 83XX as an Edison bail-out, pure and=
 simple. Wright was clear to distinguish his bill from 82XX, which he said =
has conservation easements and land requisitions, a renewable portfolio whi=
ch will add an additional fee on ratepayers, and reasonable review for long=
 term contracts. While the chances of the Richman bill being successful app=
ear slim, reports that that Hertzberg will try to negotiate elements of his=
 own bill (82XX) as amendments to the Wright/Richman measure suggest that a=
t least Hertzberg feels Richman's 83XX stands a chance.=20

?=09The Byron Sher bill, SB 78XX (Polanco) - Previously presented by Sen. P=
olanco on behalf of Governor Davis, SB 78XX has received special attention =
from Senate President, John Burton.  Although it has never been heard by a =
committee, SB 78XX is currently on the Senate floor and ready for a vote. T=
he Senate Energy Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee are both sch=
eduled to have informational hearings on this bill today.  Note, the meetin=
gs are informational because neither committee has possession of the bill. =
 These hearings will provide information to committee members, avoid a form=
al vote, and simultaneously shield Burton/Polanco from claims that the deta=
ils of SB78XX were never released.  The Senate is scheduled to be in sessio=
n tomorrow, ostensibly to vote on the state budget and SB 78XX. Given Burto=
n's penchant for wanting to keep on schedule to recess tomorrow, there is n=
o guarantee that he will hold the Senate in session once they hear SB 78XX.=
 Thus, the Senate may never even see AB 82XX and AB 83XX unless either or b=
oth bills are passed out of the Assembly today and get special treatment by=
 Burton to be heard tomorrow. Burton has previously adjourned the Senate to=
 keep on schedule once they finish their business, even if the Assembly is =
behind them.

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Attached for your review and comment is my first draft of comments to be  f=
iled on Monday with regard to the draft decisions of ALJ Barnett and  Commi=
ssioner Bilas.  Please review it carefully, as I have thrown in  everything=
 I can think of on a rush basis, and it may require some significant  editi=
ng.  Pay particular attention to Section V dealing with Bilas' request  for=
 parties to discuss alternatives to DA suspension.  The draft offers a  com=
promise to the DWR's concerns, as expressed in the Angelides memo.   Also, =
notice that Section VI urges the Commission to bifurcate the DA and PX  cre=
dit issues, acting quickly on the first, if it must, but more leisurely on =
 the PX credit subject.
=20
Finally, I have a suggestion in the form of a question.  How  would AReM me=
mbers feel about making this a joint filing with WPTF?  There  is cross-mem=
bership between the two groups and the same issues would be raised  in the =
separate filings which I am otherwise prepared to draft.  This draft  would=
 requires some modifications so as to refer to the "Joint Parties" as  oppo=
sed to solely mentioning AReM, and I might  add a section dealing more  exp=
licitly with WPTF's contribution to getting the zero minimum bill stipulati=
on  signed in the first place.  Otherwise, the document would stay much as =
it  is (subject to your input over the next few days, of course).  Please l=
et  me know what you think asap, as I am already working on a WPTF draft.  =
 Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which will =
 support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not proposi=
ng  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.  Thanks for your help!   Comm=
ents as soon as possible would be very much appreciated!

Employees: Power supply held down By Kevin Yamamura and Emily Bazar Bee Cap=
itol Bureau (Published June 22, 2001)  Three former San Diego Gas & Electri=
c Co. employees who worked at a Duke Energy plant said Thursday that the ge=
nerator destroyed working parts, withheld power supply or otherwise took ac=
tions that they believe drove up the price of electricity.  State officials=
 said the whistle-blowers' comments at a state Senate hearing today could p=
rovide the most damaging illustration yet that power generators held down p=
roduction to inflate prices on the spot market. Gov. Gray Davis has long al=
leged that power companies have overcharged the state and utilities.  Jimmy=
 Olkjer, a former assistant control room operator at Duke's South Bay plant=
 in San Diego, said in a phone interview that during the state's power shor=
tages, Duke cut supply. Although Duke, a Charlotte, N.C.-based company, own=
ed the plant, and it contracted with SDG&E to operate the unit, he said.  "=
Rather than creating more power, they were creating less," Olkjer said. "I =
think there was manipulation of the market."  The California Public Utiliti=
es Commission and several state legislative committees continue to investig=
ate price manipulation allegations, and Attorney General Bill Lockyer has s=
aid he will take witnesses to a grand jury next month.  The generators have=
 denied they manipulated the market.  "We stand behind our maintenance prac=
tices and have done a good job keeping the power flowing," Duke spokesman T=
om Williams told the CBS television network.  But former mechanic Glenn Joh=
nson said he saw generation units taken "down for economics."  Ed Edwards, =
also a mechanic, said he was ordered to destroy 23 pallets of working parts=
.  "We were asked, myself and other employees, to disperse of perfectly goo=
d parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components," Edwards =
said.  State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the market-manipulatio=
n committee, said his staff has been looking for employees or others with i=
ntimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward, and he promised=
 that others will testify at future hearings.  "It's the first time that we=
've had evidence from directly within power plants in California that the r=
amping up and ramping down of power generation was a response to price and =
not to demand," Dunn said.  He said he would reach no conclusions until Duk=
e and other generators testify next month, but he added that the former emp=
loyees' testimony raises suspicions "at first blush."   The Bee's Kevin Yam=

        Consumers cut their own power in protest  By Silvina Mart?nez Bee S=
taff Writer  (Published June 22, 2001)  When the temperature hit 100 degree=
s at 7 p.m. Thursday, Larry Lynch turned off the air conditioner, unplugged=
 the refrigerator, pulled out the TV cords and shut down all other applianc=
es in the house.  Lynch, a 61-year-old newsletter publisher in Sacramento, =
responded to the "Roll Your Own Blackout" Thursday and joined thousands thr=
oughout the state to protest energy policies and promote conservation by st=
opping the use of energy from 7-10 p.m.  But the data coming off the grid a=
t the California Independent System Operator didn't show the effort.  Durin=
g the first hour of the voluntary shut-off, the demand for energy by PG&E c=
ustomers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same time Wed=
nesday, ISO officials said.  Protesters didn't expect significant changes o=
n the grid.  "I feel it will at least send a message that we don't have to =
depend on it (energy)," said Jackie Bell, 37, a consultant at the Capitol j=
oining the conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue.  "It's j=
ust a symbolic act," said Peter Lopez of Sacramento, who decided to use the=
 evening to meditate. "Maybe I'll just go outside, stare at the stars and t=
ry to spot a few constellations in the night."  It was the longest day of t=
he year, and one of the hottest. But those determined to advocate conservat=
ion didn't mind the sacrifice.  "People are getting focused on the fact tha=
t we have power at our end," said Joan Blades, a spokeswoman for MoveOn, a =
grass-roots organization in the Bay Area and one of hundreds of online grou=
ps passing along the call for the voluntary blackout.  An electrical engine=
er in Oakland started the "Roll Your Own Blackout" idea when he posted a no=
te in a political chat room in April. Then an artist in Los Angeles forward=
ed the e-mail to a number of friends and from there it quickly spanned the =
globe.  By Thursday afternoon, more than 12,000 people had signed up at the=
 MoveOn Web site to join the protest, Blades said.  Many threw blackout par=
ties. In San Francisco, the nonprofit group Global Exchange gathered hundre=
ds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach.  At his home in east Sacramento, Ly=
nch did fine without electricity for three hours. He ate tuna salad for din=
ner, watered the lawn and when it got dark, he opened the windows and let s=
ome air in.  "We should show that people are willing to shut the power off =
if the prices go too high," he said.  ISO has not declared a power emergenc=
y since May 31.  "We have seen a consistent conservation on a day-to-day ba=
sis, and it's making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts," IS=
O spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle said.  McCorkle encouraged initiatives lik=

Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises By Ed Mendel  UNION-TRIBUNE =
STAFF WRITER  June 22, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- California may be able to avoid =
some of the blackouts predicted for this summer, thanks to a little-known p=
ower-swapping agreement with a Canadian utility.  The arrangement is expect=
ed to give California electricity in July and August from the hydroelectric=
 generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia, despite a serious drought in t=
he Northwest.  California has sold surplus power in recent months to the go=
vernment-owned utility, which is expected to return power to the state as h=
eat drives up the demand for electricity.          State deal may ease blac=
kout threat   Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis         Despit=
e the energy crunch, the state often finds itself with surplus power that c=
an be sold or swapped. For instance, advance power purchases that provide e=
nergy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any given tim=
e, particularly during off-peak hours.  BC Hydro's reservoirs and hydroelec=
tric generators are a little like an electricity storage battery. By import=
ing California power, BC Hydro has been able to conserve water that can be =
released this summer to produce power for California.  As a result of the a=
greement and other factors, state power buyers say they are in a stronger p=
osition going into the hot summer months than they had expected. So far thi=
s week, the state has managed to get through a heat wave without so much as=
 a Stage 1 power alert.  "We are in much better shape at this point than I =
imagined we would have been as little as a month ago," said Ray Hart, head =
of the power purchasing unit in the state Department of Water Resources.  T=
he North American Electric Reliability Council, which last month predicted =
260 hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer, has noticed a ch=
ange in recent weeks.  "We don't seem to have the crisis we were all expect=
ing," said Ellen Vancko, a council spokeswoman. "But whether that is a shor=
t-term or a long-term event we don't think anyone knows yet."  Much of the =
credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high conservation by=
 Californians and an increased supply of power. Many generators that had be=
en shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are now back on line.  But =
the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now.  Hart menti=
oned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week. But he declined=
 to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro, saying it could hurt t=
he state's competitive position in the market.  "If I start talking specifi=
cs," said Hart, "then I have to give out what I am doing every single day, =
and I have no market position."  In the past, California routinely sent pow=
er to a number of utilities in the Pacific Northwest during the winter when=
 residents there needed heat. Northwest utilities returned power to Califor=
nia in the summer when air conditioning drove up demand.  Little was expect=
ed from the reciprocal arrangement this year because California was short o=
f power last winter as electricity prices soared, and drought has sharply l=
owered reservoirs in the Northwest. But the agreement with BC Hydro will pr=
ovide at least some power this summer.  The state was forced to begin buyin=
g power in January after its two largest utilities, Southern California Edi=
son and Pacific Gas and Electric, were unable to borrow because of a $13 bi=
llion debt. The rates that the utilities could charge their customers were =
frozen under a failed deregulation plan as the cost of power on the wholesa=
le market skyrocketed.  Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro, which =
has demanded cash for some electricity, that it could safely do business wi=
th California despite big debts owed to generators for power they supplied =
to the utilities.  "We have only been able to do it for the last couple of =
months," said Hart. "It took a long time to get them to do it because of cr=
edit issues."  A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power s=
waps but does not release the name of the other parties or the terms of the=
 agreements.  "Our first priority is taking care of our own," said Warren C=
ousins of BC Hydro. "We are still looking for opportunities to help out oth=
er entities when we can."  Hart said the state has another arrangement with=
 the federal Bonneville Power Authority, but again refused to provide detai=
ls. He said the state has sold surplus power to several buyers, including t=
he Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  Information about state powe=
r purchases had been closely guarded until recently. Gov. Gray Davis, press=
ured by lawsuits and a court ruling, released edited versions last week of =

Ex-worker: Duke manipulated market =09
=09




By Bill Ainsworth  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  June 22, 2001  SACRAMENTO --=
 A former operator at Duke Energy's Chula Vista plant said he was told freq=
uently by company officials during the past year to alter the plant's outpu=
t in a way that may have boosted electricity prices.  The operator, Jimmy O=
lkjer, said he was even ordered to cut power generation during energy emerg=
encies, when the state faced rolling blackouts because of a scarce supply o=
f electricity.  He said he believes reducing the electricity generation hel=
ped the company charge higher prices. "It looks like that's what they were =
doing," Olkjer said in an interview.  He and another former plant employee =
said that during the past year the company regularly operated its least-eff=
icient turbine, possibly to justify higher prices.  The allegations, which =
they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing investigating power gen=
erators, provide the first insider evidence that Duke Energy may have manip=
ulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up prices.  Duke, based in No=
rth Carolina, leases the South Bay plant from the San Diego Unified Port Di=
strict.  A March report by the Independent System Operator, which manages C=
alifornia's electricity grid, alleged that by withholding power Duke and fo=
ur other owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollar=
s in overcharges to California consumers.  Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke=
 Energy North America, said that varying the output of the generating units=
 at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do with trying to achieve higher p=
rices.  He said the changes in output helped balance the state's grid by "d=
ancing in the market" -- providing flexibility for grid managers by allowin=
g the plant to add or reduce power quickly.  Williams added that the aging =
South Bay plant produced as many megawatts last year as it did in 1994.  Ol=
kjer served as a plant operator for 18 years, mostly when the plant was own=
ed by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. After Duke took over the plant, workers =
were guaranteed their jobs for two years. In April, when that period ended,=
 Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers. Now he is retired.  During the two=
 years Duke has managed the plant, Olkjer said, operators frequently got ca=
lls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in Salt Lake City=
 telling them to adjust their production schedule.  Some employees at the p=
lant monitored the hourly price of electricity posted by the Independent Sy=
stem Operator and recognized a correlation, he said.  "We noticed that a lo=
t of times when the price was down (our) megawatts would go down," he said.=
 "If the price was up, often the megawatts would go up."  Olkjer said he wa=
s never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant's output up and dow=
n. When he asked, he said, company officials told him it was none of his bu=
siness.  Still, he was puzzled, particularly when he was told to throttle d=
own the plant during electricity emergency alerts -- as he says he did Jan.=
 16 when the state declared a Stage 3 alert, with the possibility of rollin=
g blackouts.  "It doesn't make sense to cycle up and down when there's a St=
age 3 alert," he said.  Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn d=
own units at the orders of the ISO during a Stage 3 alert because the grid =
manager can find cheaper power somewhere else.  Lisa Szot, spokeswoman at t=
he ISO, said she couldn't determine whether the ISO had ordered Duke to pow=
er down its Chula Vista plant Jan. 16.  Olkjer said the frequent adjustment=
s of power production, which sometimes occurred every half-hour, wear out t=
he plant's equipment.  "It's harder on the machinery," he said. "It's like =
driving down the street putting your (foot) on the gas and then slamming on=
 the brake."  Before deregulation, Olkjer said, the four units at Chula Vis=
ta, which have the capacity to produce 706 megawatts, had been operated ste=
adily during much of their history.  S. David Freeman, formerly general man=
ager of Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power and now chief energy adv=
iser to Gov. Gray Davis, said rapid cycling had become more common under de=
regulation and is hard on equipment.  "We had almost 15,000 megawatts of ge=
nerating capacity down for repair last winter," said Freeman, referring to =
what industry experts agreed was an extraordinary level of plant outages ov=
er several months.  SDG&E, which built the Chula Vista plant in the 1960s, =
sold it to the Port District for $110 million. In 1998 the port leased the =
plant to Duke Energy for 101/2 years in what critics are now calling a swee=
theart deal.  The company pays minimal rent, but has made large profits. In=
 the first quarter of this year, Duke, which owns three other plants in Cal=
ifornia, said profits rose 208 percent to $428 million from energy sales an=
d trading.  Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for ele=
ctricity. It asked $3,880 per megawatt-hour this year. By comparison, befor=
e the energy crisis began, electricity sold for around $35 per megawatt-hou=
r, an amount which powers about 750 homes.  Federal regulators have ordered=
 the company to refund $20 million to the state for charging excessive pric=
es unless the company can justify them.  In May, the company offered to pay=
 the state to settle any price gouging investigations, but Gov. Gray Davis =
declined.  Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr., who worked at the plant for 20 years =
before being laid off in April, said they couldn't understand why Duke ran =
the inefficient, high-cost turbine unit during the past year while other ge=
nerators sat idle.  They said they believed it may have been an attempt to =
fetch a higher price for electricity because the company got extra fees whe=
n it ran.  Williams, the Duke spokesman, said the opposite was true. He sai=
d Duke ran the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive.=
 It ran on jet fuel, which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the ot=
her units.  Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destr=
oyed.  "It ran so frequently and so hard, it needed extensive repairs," he =
said.  Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista w=
ere prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts.  The =
former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward becau=
se they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community.  "It=
 kind of irritated me because you know there's people on a fixed income tha=

Estimates of Power Profits Disputed  Electricity: A study of overcharges by=
 suppliers may be flawed, state officials say. Davis quoted the figures to =
Congress.   By DOUG SMITH, ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Wr=
iters        Gov. Gray Davis' contention that California has been nicked fo=
r billions of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study tha=
t state officials concede may have significant flaws, according to intervie=
ws and confidential government documents.      Those costs--estimated by th=
e state to be as high as $9 billion--were central to Davis' testimony this =
week before a U.S. Senate committee, where he again denounced power wholesa=
lers and urged federal regulators to "give us back the money that was wrong=
ly taken from us."      The governor's impassioned demand, however, was bas=
ed on shaky calculations. The formulas are being reworked, said Charles Rob=
inson, vice president of California's grid operator, which prepared the stu=
dy.      Robinson said he "had no idea" how much the amount allegedly overc=
harged by the generators might change. For now, he said, the agency stands =
by the numbers.      But internal documents from the California Independent=
 System Operator warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quanti=
fy the alleged excess profits could be well off the mark.      What's more,=
 the documents caution against relying on the agency's study as a basis for=
 allegations of overcharging--as Davis did during his testimony Wednesday. =
That warning was particularly important because the documents provide for t=
he first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy supplier prospe=
red from the state's power troubles between last summer and February.      =
The largest amounts were charged by four out-of-state power companies, acco=
rding to the confidential Cal-ISO report. Okalhoma-based Williams Cos. led =
the group with $860 million, followed by Duke Energy with $805 million, Sou=
thern Company Energy Marketing (now Mirant) with $754 million and Reliant E=
nergy Services with $750 million.      When told of the alleged profiteerin=
g attributed to them, executives of the companies insisted the numbers were=
 grossly overstated because of Cal-ISO's poor methodology.      Duke spokes=
man Tom Williams said his company's entire energy earnings for North Americ=
a were less than the amount it was accused of reaping unfairly in Californi=
a.      "It doesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding up," Williams s=
aid. "What [Cal-ISO] has done is highly irresponsible math."      Paula Hal=
l-Collins, a Williams Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm would need to study t=
he ISO report further. But generally, she said, such reports fail to fully =
account for electricity production costs.      "We maintain that we have no=
t overcharged, and that we have operated legally."      Reliant spokesman R=
ichard Wheatley also questioned the figures, saying, "There's a lot of misi=
nformation out of there."      A Mirant spokesman said: "We haven 't overch=
arged. We haven't manipulated. We haven't withheld."       Even some firms =
alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree were outraged.      Joe=
 Ronan, vice president for government and regulatory relations at Calpine, =
said the $236 million attributed to his company "doesn't bear any relation =
to reality."      "Anybody can throw out any number," he said. "It's like M=
cCarthyism. . . . Where is the evidence?"      A spokeswoman for Davis conc=
eded that his refund figure was an estimate but defended it as reasonable. =
     "It's no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute =
an estimate of how much they're gouging us," senior advisor Nancy McFadden =
said.      Despite the cautions expressed in the Cal-ISO documents, officia=
ls Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to t=
he agency's figures as potential overcharges.       "The way it should be c=
haracterized is the amount paid above a competitive benchmark," said Robins=
on, who is also Cal-ISO's general counsel.      The first version of the no=
w-disputed Cal-ISO study was made public in March. It estimated that power =
sellers earned $6.3 billion in excess profits between May 2000 and last Feb=
ruary. The report, later revised upward to $6.7 billion, became a crucial e=
lement of the Davis Administration's campaign against alleged electricity p=
rice gougers.      This week, just before Davis' appearance in Congress, th=
e study was updated again, adding another $2.2 billions in alleged excess p=
rofits through May.      The orginal study, which did not include actual pr=
icing data, was mostly intended to prod federal regulators into seeking inf=
ormation from generators that the state had been denied, Robinson said.    =
  Thus far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds of=
 only $125 million. Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement confe=
rence aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state, as well as t=
hose of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars by =
California utilities.      One encouraging signal for state officials came =
this week when FERC reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millio=

$3,880 a megawatt hour--for thousands of hours.      FERC's order said Duke=
's pricing had resulted in $11 million in billings. A fair price for that p=

Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant  Power: Homeowners an=
d environmentalists rejoice at decision. The site is proposed as a 1,200-ac=
re state park.   By JOE MOZINGO, Times Staff Writer        In a victory for=
 environmentalists and nearby homeowners, an energy company announced Thurs=
day that it was abandoning its plan to build a power plant on the site of a=
 proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills.       La Jolla Energy Developmen=
t Inc., in a letter to the state Energy Commission, said it was withdrawing=
 its application for fast-track approval of the 53-megawatt plant and "will=
 not pursue the Baldwin facility in the future."      "We listened to the c=
ommunity," La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in an interview Thursday. =
"We need to find another place for this equipment."      The project was to=
 be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker Resources, an oil company =
that leases the land where the trailer-sized natural-gas plant would sit.  =
    Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether th=
ey will pursue the project. "At this point it's just La Jolla pulling out,"=
 Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said.      But most observers said it would =
be difficult to move forward on the fast-track schedule the state has imple=
mented to relieve the energy crisis.      The state commission was schedule=
d to decide whether to approve the project today in Sacramento, but the hea=
ring has been canceled.      The news sparked elation among environmentalis=
ts and nearby homeowners who had fought the proposal on grounds that it wou=
ld pollute neighborhoods and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together 1=
,200 acres of public open space in the hills.      "We're getting ready to =
have the biggest party," said Tony Nicholas, president of the hills' United=
 Homeowners Assn. "This shows how a community can come together for a commo=
n goal and mobilize the people in a matter of days."      About 76% of the =
residents in the hills are African American and many saw the issue as a mat=
ter of environmental justice.       In addition, Stocker and La Jolla were =
seeking approval for the plant within 21 days of filing their application, =
under the governor's emergency power orders. By following this fast-tracked=
 procedure, they would have been able to avoid the normal, time-consuming e=
nvironmental review process.      That angered opponents even further, and =
nearly 1,000 people showed up at a public hearing Monday to fight the proje=
ct.      But what officials said turned the tide against the project--at a =
time when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possibl=
e--was testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who sai=
d his agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly.      Executive=
 Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to conduct hearings =
that would take up to 60 days, pushing construction well beyond a Sept. 30 =
deadline set by the governor for fast-track projects. He also said it was u=
nlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal clean air laws.   =
   In a letter to the Energy Commission this week, Wallerstein wrote: "It a=
ppears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until som=
e time in the first part of 2002 at the earliest." By Wednesday night, the =
energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen=
t recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a p=
lant, citing Wallerstein's concerns.      Conservationists embraced the out=
come as a sign that the movement to create a park was gaining steam. The Ba=
ldwin Hills Conservancy was created last year with the idea of creating gre=
en space for the densely populated neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. With=
 support from the governor and local politicians, the state recently bought=
 a 68-acre parcel in the area for an unprecedented $41 million.      "This =
is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have worked so =
hard to bring this world-class vision to reality," said Esther Feldman, pre=
sident of Community Conservancy International and the main organizer to bui=
ld the park.      Also applauding La Jolla's decision were state Sen. Kevin=
 Murray (D-Culver City) and Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who ha=
d come out strongly against the project. They and others questioned whether=
 the small amount of power provided by the facility--coming online after th=
e dog days of summer--would do much to relieve the energy crisis.      "I'm=
 ecstatic" Wesson said. "At this point the environment has won."      The p=
lant would have sat on what is a working oil field about 650 feet from the =
Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. And according to park proponents, it wo=
uld lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy, on what would be a =
half-mile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard.      Rusch, the=
 spokesman for Stocker, said much of the information circulating about the =
trailer-sized plant is false.      The plan did not call for "a stack with =
billowing smoke," he said. "If the issue is air quality, we've cleaned air =
quality up." In the last decade, Rusch said, the company's existing 400 oil=
 pumps on the property have reduced nitrogen oxide emissions from 374 tons =
to 3 tons a year. The power plant--with two 70-foot stacks--would ultimatel=
y add about 18 tons a year.      He said the company was trying to cut its =
energy bills by providing its own power to pump oil, while also contributin=
g an extra 39 megawatts to the state grid during the energy crisis.      Re=
sidents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve the ene=

Western states could feel pinch from California pricing=20

(06-22) 02:45 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --=20
When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer, who will deci=
de whether Silicon Valley computers, Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas=
 casinos get first dibs on what's left?=20
It's a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators thi=
s week to cap electricity prices throughout the West, using a formula based=
 on California's power costs.=20
Economists, energy industry executives and officials in all 11 states are b=
eginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle.=20
Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging, ot=
hers worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for Calif=
ornia's neighbors, or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to fe=
nd off shortages. That could diminish any leverage power buyers might have =
as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day.=20
Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem =
come winter, when power demand drops in the Golden State, said Gary Ackerma=
n, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents most selle=
rs of energy.=20
States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter=
 would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap, which is usually=
 determined by a formula based on the highest bid for last-minute power dur=
ing the most recent energy supply emergency in California.=20
That may leave power wholesalers, and not a free market, to decide who gets=
 the energy.=20
"Certainly, California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for prob=
ably the last year," said Claudia Rapkoch, spokeswoman for Montana Power Co=
., which supplies natural gas and electricity to two-thirds of the Big Sky =
state. "What it means for this winter, we're just going to have to wait and=
 see."=20
California utilities had much more control over power supplies before dereg=
ulation in 1996 obligated them to sell off their power plants to encourage =
competition. This brought lower prices for a time, but gave control over po=
wer supplies to wholesalers that aren't obligated by state law to serve the=
 serve the best interests of local customers.=20
Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power=
 in the West, Ackerman predicts utilities in non-deregulated states will si=
mply sell their power within their borders. That would hurt California, whi=
ch this week imported about 10 percent of its electricity and its remaining=
 supply from local plants owned by out-of-state power companies.=20
Price cap or not, utilities in the region will watch out for each other as =
best they can, because they might need the favor returned, said Charles Rei=
nhold, executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz.=20
Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the state's budget, Ca=
lifornia recently began to sign long-term contracts with generators. Gov. G=
ray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce prices on th=
e spot market, which earlier this month fell below $50 per megawatt hour fo=
r the first time in a year.=20
The long-term contracts, though, weren't cheap. California will pay an aver=
age of $70 per megawatt hour during the next decade under 38 different cont=
racts signed so far.=20

Federal regulators have rejected attempts by Duke Energy Inc. to avoid refu=
nding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant electricity=
 prices in January and February.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March=
 9, and Duke responded by filing a challenge. But the commission on Monday =
rejected the company's appeal and reiterated its earlier order, claiming Du=
ke had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power =
for $3, 880 per megawatt hour.=20
"We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or b=
ehavior," the commission said.=20
Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged $3,880 per megawatt for ab=
out 5,500 megawatt hours sold to the state's major utilities in January and=
 February, netting it more than $19 million in receivables.=20
The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund, but it di=
rected the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a pr=
ice of $273. From a FERC document, it appears that about 2,835 hours occurr=
ed in January, which would result in a total refund for that month of $10.2=
 million.=20
Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the Californ=
ia Independent System Operator, the manager of the state's electricity grid=
, and the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californian=
s for electricity.=20
Meanwhile, employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke =
are expected to testify in a state Senate committee hearing today that the =
company ramped production up and down. That allegedly was aimed at lowering=
 power production during shortages and attempting to drive up electricity p=
rices on the spot market.=20
The workers were employed by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. but were working =
under contract to Duke.=20

Washington -- There was a reason Gov. Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket =
and endured beastly humid 90-degree heat this week in an area behind the Ca=
pitol known as the "House swamp."=20
The nation was watching. And after months of political free fall, his messa=
ge seemed to be taking hold.=20
"California has been bilked out of $9 billion while the Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission was asleep at the switch," Davis declared, repeating test=
imony he had delivered hours earlier in the air-conditioned confines of a S=
enate hearing room.=20
Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as 10 television cameras and two dozen=
 reporters recorded the scene, the California governor apparently couldn't =
resist taking another shot: "For nearly a year I've been pounding on this c=
ommission to enforce the law."=20
The state's energy crisis, with its volatile spot markets, out-of-state gen=
erators and dearth of alternative energy providers, is a dizzyingly complex=
 policy puzzle. The politics are much simpler.=20
Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders, defending helpless util=
ity customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators. Re=
publicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and long-term s=
olutions, rejecting price caps and refunds as heavy-handed overreactions wi=
th Soviet-style results.=20
The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle. Though the debate i=
s far from settled, the consumer-oriented approach to California's energy w=
oes has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in =
2002 and the White House in 2004.=20
"Republicans are scared out of their minds about this," said one gleeful De=
mocrat on Capitol Hill, who suggested that the White House's lackadaisical =
response to California's problems would rile consumers from coast to coast.=
=20
"This could rival Pete Wilson's alienation of Latinos," said the Democrat, =
referring to the former Republican governor's strident stand against illega=
l immigrants, which many blame for the party's weak standing in California.=
=20
A sign of the GOP's concern surfaced this week with television ads, finance=
d by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists, that b=
lame the Democratic governor for California's energy problems.=20
Democrats, who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second =
term, now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal regu=
lators to take a more active role.=20
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which had previously resisted suc=
h efforts, took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monda=
y. Later in the week, two commissioners appointed by President Bush testifi=
ed that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge r=
efunds to California. And just yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney, who h=
as been among California's most vocal critics, told Senate Democrats behind=
 closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal regula=
tors agreed, according to those in the meeting.=20
"There is no doubt in my mind that action (taken by federal regulators) was=
 the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the Califo=
rnia delegation," Davis said.=20
The pressure did not come only from Democrats. Republican lawmakers, some o=
f whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in 2002, wrote FERC last week,=
 requesting commissioners to "take further actions" to help the state.=20
The Democrats' public relations success follows an effort by the party to r=
aise the profile of its consumer crusade. Hardly a day has passed in the pa=
st several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference to =
attack the White House, the Republican controlled House or FERC for inactio=
n.=20
But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far mor=
e focused on long-term energy production than the immediate concerns of Cal=
ifornians. Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to so=
lve the power mess, the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the pli=
ght of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling blackou=
ts.=20
Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month. =
But the damage appears to have extended beyond California.=20
A CBS News/New York Times poll released this week of 1,050 adults from acro=
ss the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bus=
h was doing on energy. More than half the respondents said that protecting =
the environment was a higher priority than producing energy, yet barely one=
 in 10 said that Bush shared that priority.=20
Some Republicans say that Bush was in a no-win position, contending that an=
ything he did would have been attacked by California's opportunistic govern=
or.=20
"Politics is (Davis') main objective, and I don't see the Bush administrati=
on being that way," said Rep. George Radanovich, R-Fresno.=20
The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too suc=
cessful. By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role, D=
emocrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient scapego=
at.=20
"Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat. No=
w that FERC has given him what he wants, or close enough to it, it's a lot =
harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in,"=
 said Dan Schnur, a GOP analyst based in San Francisco.=20

Suit filed over report on power lines, health=20
Deal on transmission grid could raise liability=20

01/06/22/MN114037.DTL&type=3Dnews =20
As state legislators consider Gov. Gray Davis' deal to buy part of the powe=
r grid in California, a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yeste=
rday demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards =
of living near high-voltage transmission lines.=20
The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the $2.76 billion de=
al to buy Southern California Edison's power lines, said Terry Francke, gen=
eral counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, which filed the =
lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court. The power line deal was brokered =
by the governor to help the cash-strapped utility.=20
Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug. 15 or the utility =
can back out. Davis also has a $1 billion agreement to purchase San Diego G=
as and Electric's power grid, which also would require the Legislature's ap=
proval.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines.=20
The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and Ma=
gnetic Fields Program, an agency set up by the state Department of Health S=
ervices to study the issue, Francke said. Both state agencies and their dir=
ectors are named in the lawsuit.=20
Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect, Francke said.=20
"If it's known there's some danger . . . do you want the state owning that =
liability?" he asked.=20
The study began in 1993 after the state Public Utilities Commission committ=
ed $7.2 million for research and education on the subject, Francke said.=20
The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and elect=
ric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies base=
d on those findings, he said.=20
The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May 7, but "at the=
 last minute, the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the sta=
ff of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret," the lawsuit said.=20
State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only =
a draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC.=20
"The PUC wanted to see the draft before (it is released)," she said. "We pr=
epared (the report) for them. We are following their request."=20
Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit, saying her office hadn't seen it. PU=
C officials were not available for comment.=20
Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens=
us on their effects, Francke said. That's what makes the state study import=
ant for legislators to consider before voting on the governor's deal to buy=
 transmission lines, he said.=20
Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to D=
avis' agreements with the utilities. Some legislators would rather the stat=
e help build more power generators in California.=20
"They are extra nails in the coffin," said James Fisfis, spokesman for stat=
e Assembly minority leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks. "We have fundamental issu=
es with the transmission lines, but when you start stacking these items up,=
=20
you have an undigestible deal."=20
Davis' spokesman Roger Salazar said he believed the governor hadn't seen th=
e health hazard report.=20
"Obviously, if something pops up and is an issue, you'll take a look at it,=
 but I don't think we're at that point yet," he said.=20
An Alameda County Superior Court judge will hear the lawsuit on July 23, Fr=
ancke said.=20

Texas power firm's shares falling=20

=20
There's trouble in Texas.=20
Enron Corp., the Houston power firm that's profited mightily during Califor=
nia's energy crisis, is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on Wall S=
treet.=20
While all eyes have been on Enron's enormous profits here and its enormous =
pull in Washington, D.C., the reputed titan of the newly incarnated, free- =
wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization -- more tha=
n $30 billion -- since its peak in August.=20
Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston b=
oys' reversal of fortunes. But what gives? Isn't this the company that was =
fattening up on the backs of the state's beleaguered utilities, residents a=
nd state budget? Isn't this the company with such close ties to the Bush ad=
ministration that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, was reported to have inter=
viewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his company?=
=20
Yup. That Enron.=20
On Monday, Enron shares hit a 52-week low of $43.07, after the Federal Ener=
gy Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power =
marketers such as Enron that had applied to power-generating companies for =
months. That's a far cry from August, when the company's shares peaked at $=
90.=20
"There's a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with=
 in the marketplace right now, none of which on the surface is a major deal=
," said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities i=
n Houston. "But when you combine them all . . . I think what's happening he=
re is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement. You have people say=
ing, 'OK, the growth rate is now in question.' "=20
That growth rate was an eye-popping 88.82 percent in revenues for the Unite=
d States on a two-year average, and nearly 98 percent in the rest of the wo=
rld. Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews, but as th=
e stock continued to drop Tuesday morning, chief executive Jeff Skilling is=
sued a statement to the markets in which he reiterated "strong confidence" =
in its earnings guidance. The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week,=
 closing at $44.05 yesterday.=20
In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night, Skilling blamed regulatory=
 interference with the "free market" for investor flight from his company.=
=20
"Our stock prices have gotten hammered," he said. "They're half what they w=
ere a year ago."=20
Tumbling stock prices weren't the only bad news for Skilling last night. A =
protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began speaki=
ng. As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face, a woman wa=
s arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges.=20
Enron isn't the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with C=
alifornia's power crisis and are now suddenly headed south. Shares of Relia=
nt Energy Inc., AES Inc. and Williams Companies Inc., which generate and se=
ll electricity in California, and El Paso Energy Corp., which sells natural=
 gas here, are all trading near 52-week lows.=20
The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou=
t power price controls, re-regulation and now, the possibility of big refun=
ds being ordered for California. Even Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which has =
developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th=
e spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics, dropped nea=
rly 7 percent yesterday, to $37.10. But none of the companies has been hit =
as hard as Enron.=20
Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any=
 company. It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth, and because =
executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price, a sharp decline m=
akes it more difficult to retain talented leaders.=20
While Enron's power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine, the firm h=
as been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other re=
gions in recent months. In the financial press, the continuing knock on Enr=
on is that its business lines are so new and complex, and the company is so=
 secretive about its operations, that analysts and fund managers don't feel=
 confident in their understanding of what it does.=20
A look at the firm's recent troubles exemplifies its diversity.=20
For instance, Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme=
nt of Maharashtra in India over a 2,184-megawatt power plant there. The Dah=
bol Power Co., which is 65 percent controlled by Enron, stopped constructio=
n on a second phase of the project on Sunday, claiming it is owed $48 milli=
on by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The state has accused Enron =
of charging too much and not generating enough, and stopped buying power fr=
om the plant last month.=20
Closer to home, Enron has struggled with its investments in fiber-optic ban=
dwidth. The company buys and sells unused, high-speed bandwidth space, trea=
ting it like a commodity as it does electricity, coal or natural gas. But t=
he fiber-optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear t=
hat for all the long-distance cable laid in the ground, there have not been=
 enough "last mile" connections set up for users to actually take advantage=
 of it. Earlier this year, Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with Bl=
ockbuster to offer what it called "video on demand," in which customers at =
home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it =
transmitted via fiber-optic cables.=20
Then there was the FERC ruling. For months, the agency had resisted aggress=
ive price controls in the West, preferring to let the market run its course=
. But as control of the U.S. Senate was handed to Democrats this month and =
President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III to =
the commission, the agency changed its tune. It expanded price controls to =
all hours of the day, spread the controls throughout the Western region and=
 brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent.=20
So under current calculations, that means Enron could sell power for no mor=
e than $108 per megawatt in a shortage and about $90 during normal hours --=
 far short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly chargin=
g during the past year.=20
In part, the company's gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of=
 the businesses Enron has decided to pursue. And the hard-charging company =
has a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets. But some=
times that approach gets it in trouble, as was the case last year, when Enr=
on had to take a $400 million charge for its failed investment in Azurix, a=
 global water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply =
the same way it had done for electricity service, as governments privatized=
 their water systems. The opportunities never materialized.=20
Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a price-earnings =
ratio of nearly 39, considerably above the liberal standard of health, whic=
h is 25. The company had less than $1 billion in profits on more than $100 =
billion in revenues last year. Still, a survey by Thomson Financial/First C=
all found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of 42 cents per sh=
are in the second quarter (up from 34 cents last year), and $1.79 per share=
 on the year. Most maintain a strong "buy" rating on the stock.=20
But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit. Hardest-put of =
them will be the Janus funds, which, as Enron's largest mutual fund investo=
r, held nearly $3.33 billion of its stock as of the end of April.=20
In a semiannual report to investors, John Schreiber, a portfolio manager, s=
aid the stock price of the "new-age energy merchant" was a victim of negati=
ve psychology resulting from the California energy crisis. Janus declined t=
o make fund managers available for interviews.=20
"There are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets," said Raymo=
nd Niles, an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "When yo=
u're an aggressive first-mover, from time to time you're going to make mist=
akes. But I don't think any of the mistakes Enron has made hit the core of =
the company."=20

Power firm accused of price-fixing Former employees say Duke Energy slowed =
production of electricity to create an artificial shortage, boost profits  =
BY DION NISSENBAUM  Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  SACRAMENTO -- One of th=
e largest companies producing power in California ordered workers to throw =
out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effort to drive up the price =
of electricity, former power plant workers said Thursday.  Speaking out on =
the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing, the three men offered the=
 strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer -- Duke Energy -- =
sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage that may have =
created huge electricity price spikes.  ``Their intent, in my opinion, was =
to boost the price up,'' said Glenn Johnson, a mechanic who worked for two =
decades at the Chula Vista power plant now run by Duke. ``If I've got the o=
nly box of penicillin in town and you're sick, I can charge a million dolla=
rs a box,'' he said. ``If you want to live, you're going to have to pay.'' =
 Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations, calling them irrespo=
nsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April.  ``Their al=
legations are just comical, just highly erroneous,'' said Tom Williams, a s=
pokesman for Duke, which runs four plants in California that produce enough=
 energy for nearly 2.6 million homes.  The charges come as the state heads =
into negotiations next week with generators over the $8.9 billion the state=
 claims its consumers have been overcharged. Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C.=
, came under considerable criticism when it disclosed that it charged the s=
tate a record $3,880 a megawatt-hour for power in January. Federal official=
s have called the charge unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California=
 the money.  The employees, who first made their allegations public on ``CB=
S Evening News'' Thursday night, will be the only witnesses today at an ene=
rgy crisis hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies hav=
e been illegally gouging California.  State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, =
chairman of a committee investigating price gouging, said the allegations r=
aise serious concerns. ``While we still need to hear the other side of the =
story from Duke, if there's any truth to the information, I believe it woul=
d be devastating to the generators,'' he said.  `Perfectly good parts'  In =
interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night, the three former plant wor=
kers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and throw=
 out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full power for=
 weeks.  Ed Edwards, who worked in the Southern California plant, said that=
 he was told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts. Edwards said he =
tossed more than 23 pallets of parts into a dumpster.  ``I don't know why t=
hey were throwing away perfectly good parts,'' he said. ``It didn't make se=
nse.''  Johnson said the lack of on-site parts prevented workers from quick=
ly fixing problems that reduced the amount of power the plant could produce=
. Sometimes, he said, it took weeks to get parts.  Johnson's suspicions of =
gouging were echoed by Jimmey Olkjer, who spent 18 years in the plant and w=
orked as an assistant control operator.  Even at times when California regu=
lators were warning residents the state might not be able to find enough en=
ergy to prevent imminent blackouts, Olkjer said, he was directed to scale b=
ack the amount of electricity the plant was producing.  ``In hindsight, it =
looks to me like they were manipulating the power,'' Olkjer said.  Duke cal=
led the allegations ``baseless'' and said the workers didn't understand the=
 reasons for the actions. ``Continued accusations, repetitive investigation=
s and inflammatory rhetoric concerning the company's operations in the stat=
e are distracting attention from the true issue of solving California's ene=
rgy crisis,'' Duke said in a statement.  Williams did not directly dispute =
the worker's allegations. But he said they did not understand the reasons b=
ehind the decisions.  State directives  Duke cut back on the amount of powe=
r it was producing in response to directives from state regulators at the I=
ndependent System Operator, which runs the power grid, Williams said.  ``Th=
ey did not know that the ISO was instructing them to go up and down to meet=
 supply and demand,'' he said.  An ISO spokeswoman said that the grid manag=
er sometimes asks generators to produce more or less power to adjust traffi=
c on the transmission system or respond to the state's electricity needs.  =

Enron chief: Gov. Davis not to blame for energy crisis BY KAREN GAUDETTE As=
sociated Press Writer SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California Gov. Gray Davis isn'=
t to blame for California's power crisis, and neither are electricity whole=
salers, a Texas energy executive told a crowd at the Commonwealth Club of C=
alifornia.  Jeffrey Skilling, CEO and president of Houston-based Enron Corp=
., wiped away the remnants of a pie hurled by a protester Thursday and plac=
ed the blame squarely on California's energy regulators.  The state Public =
Utilities Commission in the early 1990s put together a broken market by pre=
venting utilities to pass along the full cost of power and discouraging pow=
er contracts that would have lowered dependence on buying last-minute power=
, Skilling said.  ``Because of these rules, the power consumers of the stat=
e of California were thrown totally to the mercy of the spot market,'' Skil=
ling said.  PUC president Loretta Lynch defended the regulators' actions la=
st week, saying utilities have been free to enter into long-term contracts.=
 Utilities countered that the PUC never made clear what contracts it would =
accept, which left open the possibility they would later be overruled.  ``I=
 think consumers in California are angry and they should be,'' Skilling sai=
d. ``Prices in California shouldn't be as high as they are.''  Skilling als=
o:  --Congratulated Davis for California's ``unprecedented'' conservation  =
--Denied accusations that Enron chairman Kenneth Lay personally interviewed=
 candidates for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees in=
terstate energy markets  --Told the audience to expect a report that would =
show California municipal utilities have profited the most selling power to=
 the state  --Said price caps ordered by FERC earlier this week would likel=
y damage the markets and would only exacerbate the problem  --Acknowledged =
that municipal utilities in the state have managed to provide cheaper power=
 to their customers and even profit from the power crisis by selling off ex=
tra power despite public control  Enron has come under fire after accusatio=
ns from Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced=
 electricity prices skyward by holding back supply.  Enron denies such clai=
ms, and joins other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities=
 still owe them billions in unpaid bills. Davis acknowledges that Pacific G=
as & Electric Co., which has declared bankruptcy, and Southern California E=
dison together still owe generators such as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and =
Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past electricity sales.  ``Our succes=
s is linked to efficient markets, not higher prices in California or anywhe=
re else,'' Skilling said.  Protesters gathered outside the building wearing=
 pig masks and carrying hand-made signs, one of which read ``Greed is the o=
nly power crisis.''  ``It's basically Enron and the other companies raising=
 prices,'' said Bernard Greening, a Santa Clara computer programmer who sai=
d he's unhappy with the record prices for electricity and natural gas.  Pet=
e Snoek of Tiburon said he believed what Skilling had to say.  ``I believe =
the energy situation has been politicized so badly,'' Snoek said, saying he=
 was one of several in the audience to shush protesters during the meeting.=
 ``I hear the same people out there, as if it's a sin to make any money in =
this country.''  State officials counter that wholesalers charged as much a=
s $9 billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000.  Companies hav=
e said California's claims are wildly exaggerated.  The Federal Energy Regu=
latory Commission has already estimated that wholesalers owe California $12=
4 million in overcharges for the first four months of the year. Davis and o=
thers say that's a mere drop in the bucket.  Enron has also been tied to Pr=
esident Bush's hands-off approach to the energy crisis. Company chairman Ke=
nneth Lay is a friend and one of the largest campaign contributors to Bush =
and the GOP. Several prominent members of the Bush administration hold stoc=
k in the company.  Enron is one of several major GOP donors accused of meet=
ing secretly with Vice President Dick Cheney as he drafted the Bush adminis=
tration's energy plan.  Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, na=
tural gas and communications companies, with $101 billion in revenues in 20=
00. It owns 30,000 miles of pipeline, has 20,000 employees and is active in=

n, the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigative committee on pr=

stle-blowers. But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room is expected=
 to set off a media circus. And if the accusations are true, it could have =
wide-ranging effects on the North Carolina company's operations in Californ=
ia. Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for the hear=

 kinds of things that didn't make sense," Johnson said in an interview. "Bu=
t if you asked them why, to explain, they told you to shut up and do your j=
ob."  The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commi=
ssion ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund $10 million in overcharges fo=
r January 2001.  "This information lends credence to the concern that there=
 was a deliberate strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting pr=
ice," Dunn said. "What they are saying is disturbing."  Duke Energy spokesm=
an Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lost their jobs may b=
e shaping their testimony.  "The proof is in the pudding. Production is up =
and we've had fewer forced outages since we've taken over,'' said Williams.=
  But control-room logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Duke's =
trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce prod=
uction minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued. The logs are for Janua=
ry 2001 - the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in Californi=
a.  The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for =
more than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. They l=
ost their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant.  The three =
whistle-blowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the Register.=
 The accusations include:  The company ordered workers to throw unopened bo=
xes of bolts, steam seals, valves and other parts into Dumpsters. The parts=
 were needed to perform routine maintenance but were no longer available wh=
en repairs were required. Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were di=
scarded, but say the high inventory tax made it more efficient to order par=
ts as needed because they could be delivered within 24 hours.  Edwards and =
Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment necessary for=
 the generating units to run at full capacity. Because parts were thrown aw=
ay, they couldn't make repairs and generators ran at diminished capacity fo=
r days or weeks. Energy experts say this allegation, if true, would allow D=
uke to withhold energy from the marketplace, which could drive up the price=
. Duke officials counter that production has increased at its power plants =
and forced outages have decreased since they took over. But in late 2000, t=
here was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant, according to records =
kept by the state's power-grid operator. The plant reported 3,000 hours of =
outages from October through December. There were relatively few outages be=
fore that.  The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them =
to use a small, expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke =
took over the plant. Experts say that could have been used to exploit feder=
al rules allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units=
 online.  Olkjer says he received orders from Duke's trading arm to reduce =
production. Then, when energy prices jumped, he would get new instructions =
to power up again. Duke officials did not respond to Olkjer's claim.  Stanf=
ord professor Frank Wolak, an expert in California's energy market, said th=
at if their testimony can be proven, the state could be refunded millions o=
f dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced.  "What th=
ey are saying is amazing. This is a classic plot. I've always wondered how =
they kept the generators out for so long,'' said Wolak, who heads an electr=
icity market surveillance for the California agency that oversees the buyin=
g and selling of power. "They were very happy to have them off-line because=
 it allowed them to make more money.  Wolak said the testimony seems to bac=
k up research conducted by the state Independent System Operator, which run=
s most of the state's power grid and oversees the buying and selling of ele=
ctricity in California.  In a report to federal regulators, ISO said that f=
rom May to November 2000, Duke withheld electricity from the state's power =
grid 80 percent of the time. The report accused more than a dozen power pla=
nt companies of powering down generators to create scarcity in the marketpl=
ace that would in turn drive up prices.  In a separate report, the state po=
wer grid operator accused Duke of overcharging California again in January =
of this year, resulting in the $10 million refund order. Duke officials say=
 charging $3,880 a megawatt-hour was justified during a short period of tim=
e. Federal regulators disagreed and said the power merchant should have cha=
rged no more than $273 per megawatt-hour.  Williams, Duke's spokesman, said=
 that the company has been an ethical operator.  "All but 1.1 percent of th=
e time, we were operating. That's very good,'' said Williams, adding that w=
hen SDG&E owned the plant forced outages took place 1.8 percent of the time=
.  But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistle-blowers is true, an=
d Duke had the ability to manipulate prices, federal regulators would be re=
quired under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive mark=
etplace.  This would mean they would be moved back into a "cost-based" mark=

      Davis seeks $9 billion refund  The governor tells a Senate panel that=
 power operators 'bilked our state.'  June 21, 2001  By DENA BUNIS and KATE=
 BERRY The Orange County Register  WASHINGTON - Gov. Gray Davis told anyone=
 here who would listen Wednesday that overcharges from what he calls greedy=
 power generators have now risen to $9 billion - $2 billion more than earli=
er reported.  And he wants that money back.  The governor said if the meeti=
ngs federal regulators have ordered next week to try and hammer out the dif=
ferences between power companies, utilities and the state do not end with t=
hat kind of money in California's pocket, he'll be back.  "They must be req=
uired to give us back our money,'' Davis told the Senate Government Affairs=
 Committee during two hours of testimony and questioning. It was the first =
time California's chief executive has testified on the state's crisis. "It =
is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bil=
ked our state for up to $9 billion."  The $9 billion is the amount Californ=
ia's Independent System Operator says generators overcharged utilities and =
the state from May 2000 to May of this year. It had initially calculated th=
at between May 2000 and February 2001 there were $6.7 billion in overcharge=
s, Davis said. Those figures are a far cry from the $124 million that the F=
ederal Energy Regulatory Commission says were overcharges. That's because F=
ERC only looked at three months of rates and only when the state was in an =
energy alert.  The governor faced tough, pointed questioning from Republica=
n members and glowing praise and sympathy for his state's plight from Democ=
ratic colleagues.  Everything from refunds to long-term contracts will be o=
n the table at next week's settlement meeting. FERC has given the parties u=
ntil July 9 to make a deal.  If they can't, the administrative judge overse=
eing the talks will make a recommendation to FERC, which can order the payb=
acks. Sen. Barbara Boxer introduced a bill Wednesday to require refunds if =
FERC doesn't act.  Not surprisingly, generators don't see the refund issue =
the governor's way.  "It's just crazy," said Tom Williams, a spokesman at D=
uke Energy. "I don't know how they're coming up with these numbers."  And t=
here's skepticism about next week's talks.  "The negotiations are going to =
be like the SALT Treaty," said Gary Ackerman, president of the Western Powe=
r Trading Forum, which represents power suppliers. "I question whether it c=
an happen and work out."  Also at issue is money generators say they are ow=
ed by the utilities. Davis said that's about $2.5 billion. But power compan=
ies say it's more like $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion.  Whatever the figure, =
Davis said, "we want to see their money in our pockets before we talk about=
 working anything out on their end."  The settlement conference was part of=
 FERC's order instituting around-the-clock price caps for California and it=
s 10 Western neighbors. Those price caps were made possible, experts agree,=
 because California lawmakers from both sides of the aisle riled up the pub=
lic enough over the issue that the Bush administration felt the heat.  The =
question is whether that can work with refunds.  "Pressure could come from =
a number of places," said Charles Cook, a nonpartisan political analyst who=
 has followed California's crisis. "It could come from Republican members f=
rom the state, from party donors in California who (President George W.) Bu=

      In rolling blackouts, 'together' is all relative  June 21, 2001  I ha=
ve a confession to make: I'm an N001. And as an N001 I can't help feeling a=
 little guilty.  I feel guilty that I won't be called upon to share the pai=
n of all those A001s in  Irvine and Laguna Woods, or the M003s in Costa Mes=
a and Cypress. While the M011s in Fountain  Valley suffer and sweat through=
 rolling blackouts, I'll be sitting pretty.  Because I'm an N001. And the d=
irty little secret about rolling power blackouts is how many of us are out =
there.  Allow me to explain.  As you may have heard, Southern California Ed=
ison has been required to set up a public notification system for rolling b=
lackouts. If you hear on the news that the power guys are expecting rolling=
 blackouts, you can go to a Web site (www.sce.com ) or call a toll-free pho=
ne number (800-611-1911) to see if your "rotating outage group" is on the l=
ist for going temporarily dark.  How do you know which group you're in? On =
your Edison power bill, next to your account number, there's a code that st=
arts with A or M - A001, A002, M001, M002 and so on. That's your outage gro=
up number.  But wait. There's another category of outage group. If your pow=
er bill has the code number N001 on it, it means that you're exempt from ro=
lling blackouts.  You see, under Public Utilities Commission rules, electri=
c power customers who provide "essential public health, safety and security=
 services" - such as fire and police stations, hospitals, jails and so on -=
 are automatically exempt from rolling blackouts, even if they have emergen=
cy generators on site. And because of the way electric power service is set=
 up, anybody who's on the same circuit with an essential service provider i=
s also exempt from rolling blackouts.  For example, my house shares a circu=
it with a fire station. So I'm an exempt N001, as are the other power custo=
mers on the same circuit.  But here's the kicker: According to an Edison sp=
okesman, 50 percent of all Edison customers are N001s - that is, they share=
 circuits with essential service providers, and thus are currently exempt f=

When I asked about it for a column three months ago, Edison said it didn't =

ssed yesterday, Davis publicly demands nearly $9  billion for electricity o=
vercharges...=09



    WASHINGTON (AP)   California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power
generators refund nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and
complained that federal regulators have ``looked the other way
while energy companies bilked our state.''
    Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in
California and 10 other Western states was a step forward.
    ``But its actions do nothing about the overcharges'' over the
past year, he said.
    The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans,
who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of
hand.
    Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up
approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation
programs. He also said the state has little control over price
gouging by out-of-state power generators.
    ``The governor once said he could solve California's problems in
15 minutes. ... But it appears that California has continued to try
and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it
instead of the utilities,'' putting California taxpayers in
jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
    Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public
power entities not under FERC jurisdiction
    Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee, said the FERC, which regulates wholesale
electricity sales, has been slow to respond and ``surprisingly
reluctant'' to assure that electricity prices are just and
reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.
    The agency's response to the Western power problem ``raises
serious questions about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the
newly deregulated energy markets'' not only in the West but across
the rest of the country.
    The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in
the day, imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in
California and 10 other Western states from Washington to Arizona.
The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next
week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues.
    Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged
overcharges by power generators. The power companies have since
challenged the agency's findings and the matter remains in dispute.
    ``To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to
California,'' complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and
the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have
overcharged California $8.9 billion.
    ``They must be required to give us back our money,'' said Davis.
``It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy
companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion.''
    The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27
billion in 2000 and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this
year, said Davis.
    ``Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over
our energy market,'' he said.
    Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not
addressing the problem. He said newly approved power plants will
provide 20,000 additional megawatts of electricity by 2003,
including 4,000 megawatts by the end of this summer.
    ``Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable
energy to California is being done ... except wholesale price
relief,'' he said.
    ``This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more
months,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President
Bush's repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity
prices. Bush has strongly opposed price controls, although he
indicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation effort this
week.
    Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration
so that businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC
press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not
only in California but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity
prices have also skyrocketed.
    Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price
caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants.
    ``Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and
reasonable price is laughable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican. Hard price caps
``don't work when supply is the problem. ... They make a bad
situation worse,'' he said.
    After FERC issued its limited price control order this week,
Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to
require more stringent cost-based price caps on Western electricity
sales.
    Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to
pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.

The Honorable Joseph Dunn
Chair, Senate Select Committee
California State Senate
Room 2080
California State Capitol
Sacramento, CA 95814

Dear Senator Dunn:

Earlier this year, you met individually with IEP and various other parties =
to explain the purpose of the Senate Select Committee?s hearing and the pro=
cess under which they were to be conducted.  You made it very clear that yo=
u were planning to have fact-finding hearings based upon fundamental fairne=
ss and due process.  You made a further commitment that there would be no s=
urprises.  Prior to today, the hearings have been conducted consistent with=
 that representation.

Unfortunately, today it appears that the Committee has set a new course tha=
t radically departs from these previous commitments.  Today, the Committee =
is hearing testimony from several surprise witnesses.  These witnesses are =
former employees of San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) under contract with =
Duke Energy for an interim period during which Duke Energy operated the fac=
ilities in San Diego.   It is our understanding that these former contract =
employees are alleging that the company failed to properly maintain these f=
acilities, and they are alleging that Duke Energy cycled these facilities d=
ifferently than the former owner, SDG&E.  It is also our understanding that=
 Duke Energy will not be afforded the opportunity to contemporaneously chal=
lenge these allegations and/or provide an explanation as to the operational=
 behavior of the facilities.  In short, the hearings are being reduced to a=
 media event, giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of disgruntl=
ed ex-employees.

Respectfully, it would appear that the Committee has wandered far afield of=
 its stated goals.  These hearings have the potential of identifying what w=
ent wrong with California?s energy policy and how to fix it.  However, this=
 will only occur if this inquiry is based on informal facts and complete in=
formation, not innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations.  It is the pursuit=
 of facts, not headlines, which will solve California?s energy crisis.  The=
se facts will be revealed only in a fair process, where allegations made ar=
e subject to contemporaneous response. =20

It is our hope that today?s process is an aberration, and not a departure f=
rom your commitments.  The Committee is at a crossroads.  It can choose to =
engage in fact-finding and analysis, or it can be reduced to a witch-hunt i=
n pursuit of headlines.  For the benefit of all Californian?s, the Committe=
e should focus on fact-finding and analysis.

Sincerely,



Jan Smutny-Jones
Executive Director

=DJ LADWP, Run By Davis Adviser, Cashed In On Calif Crisis

Dow Jones Capital Markets Report via Dow Jones


   By Jason Leopold
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


  LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--On a single day in June 2000, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, the largest municipal utility in the country,
raked in $5 million selling California surplus power for $1,000 a
megawatt-hour
- about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before.

  That sale, reported by the California Independent System Operator and
confirmed by the LADWP in an interview last June, was one of many instances
in
which the municipal utility cashed in on California's power crisis.

  On Monday, the Department of Water Resources, the agency that has been
purchasing California's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's
cash-strapped
utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing
the
LADWP charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from
Jan.
18 through May 31 this year. That price is about $35 higher than those
charged
by most of the out-of-state generators Gov. Gray Davis has criticized
repeatedly
as price gougers.

  Potentially embarrassing for the Davis administration, however, is that
the
LADWP was formerly run by General Manager David Freeman, who in April became
Davis' top energy adviser.

  Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said Texas-based generators are
primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's
two
largest utilities.

  "Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across
their
face, because they are robbing us blind," he said. "The bad guys are clearly
the
out-of-state generators."

  Freeman's trademark is a white Stetson.

  The former LADWP chief, who last September quipped that a "blind pig could
make money" under California's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return
calls
for comment.

  Freeman took a leave of absence from the LADWP in January to negotiate
long-term power contracts on behalf of the state.

     Power To Sell


  According to the DWR report, the LADWP brought in $331 million selling
power
to the state between Jan. 18 and May 31 this year.

  The LADWP, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and
which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed
in
throughout 2000. The utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but
only
needs about 5,500 MW to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as
much
as 1,000 megawatts to the ISO at prices comparable to what the generators
were
charging.

  The LADWP did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt
and
will reduce its customers' rates in 2002.

  "It just shows you that enterprise is where you find it," Freeman said in
an
interview last year.

  Last July, ratings agency Fitch concluded that California's electricity
shortage provided LADWP "an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at
favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."

  According to a report by the ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid,
the
LADWP overcharged California for power from May 2000 through February 2001
by as
much as $20 million. Maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the
utility.

  On Tuesday, an LADWP spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying
the
costs of producing electricity were extremely high.

  The ISO has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for
electricity sales in the 12 months ended May 2001. On Monday, settlement
talks
between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down.

  Other municipal utilities, including the Sacramento Municipal Utility
District
and private companies like BC Hydro in Canada, have also racked up enormous
sums
selling surplus power to California at the last minute.

Mike,

Attached are the Select Committee's Confidentiality Agreement and Document
Depository Protocol.  As Senator Dunn reiterated a number of times during
the hearing and meeting with you, the three conditions for compliance are
that Enron sign the attached confidentiality agreement, sign the attached
document depository protocol and deposit into the depository documents
responsive to the Select Committee's priority list of 16 document
categories.  These 3 conditions remain the same.  The Select Committee does
not agree to enter into a "protective order."  The attached confidentiality
agreement is intended to be just that and not "an outline for a proposed
protective order."

The Senator and Larry Drivon will review your proposed nonwaiver agreement
and get back to you on that after they have had a chance to do so.

Should you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to call Larry
Drivon at (916) 445-5831.

Alexandra
(916) 445-5831

here are the CA numbers from a survey conducted the first week in
August by Voter/Consumer Research, run by Jan Von Louhausen, the
pollster for President Bush:

Gray Davis

UNFAV	       44

STRONG UNFAV     28
STRONG FAV          15

WRONG TRACK      49


DAVIS  		40
RIORDAN          39




Note that the strong fav/unfav is a 1:1.8, which is one of the worst
numbers I have ever seen for an incumbent Governor in 20 years.  The
fav/unfav is an anemic 1:1.  The right track/wrong track is
devastating, and the gubernatorial ballot is tied.  These numbers
have changed dramatically and put Davis in a very precarious
situation politically.

At the IEP meeting yesterday, we heard that the Governor did some polling and 
focus groups a few weeks ago that found very good response if he goes after 
the refund issue.  So, here we go.

		 Subject: ALERT:  As discussed yesterday, Davis publicly demands nearly $9  
billion for electricity overcharges...


    WASHINGTON (AP)   California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power
generators refund nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and
complained that federal regulators have ``looked the other way
while energy companies bilked our state.''
    Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in
California and 10 other Western states was a step forward.
    ``But its actions do nothing about the overcharges'' over the
past year, he said.
    The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans,
who charge he has allowed the California power crisis to get out of
hand.
    Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up
approval for new power plants and strengthened conservation
programs. He also said the state has little control over price
gouging by out-of-state power generators.
    ``The governor once said he could solve California's problems in
15 minutes. ... But it appears that California has continued to try
and hide the true cost of power by having the state pay for it
instead of the utilities,'' putting California taxpayers in
jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
    Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public
power entities not under FERC jurisdiction
    Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental
Affairs Committee, said the FERC, which regulates wholesale
electricity sales, has been slow to respond and ``surprisingly
reluctant'' to assure that electricity prices are just and
reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.
    The agency's response to the Western power problem ``raises
serious questions about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the
newly deregulated energy markets'' not only in the West but across
the rest of the country.
    The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in
the day, imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in
California and 10 other Western states from Washington to Arizona.
The agency also ordered the parties to attend a conference next
week to try to work out agreements on overcharges and other issues.
    Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged
overcharges by power generators. The power companies have since
challenged the agency's findings and the matter remains in dispute.
    ``To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to
California,'' complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and
the beginning of this month power generators are believed to have
overcharged California $8.9 billion.
    ``They must be required to give us back our money,'' said Davis.
``It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy
companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion.''
    The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27
billion in 2000 and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this
year, said Davis.
    ``Power generators have been able to exert extreme power over
our energy market,'' he said.
    Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not
addressing the problem. He said newly approved power plants will
provide 20,000 additional megawatts of electricity by 2003,
including 4,000 megawatts by the end of this summer.
    ``Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable
energy to California is being done ... except wholesale price
relief,'' he said.
    ``This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more
months,'' said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President
Bush's repeated refusal to urge the FERC to mitigate electricity
prices. Bush has strongly opposed price controls, although he
indicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation effort this
week.
    Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration
so that businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC
press its investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not
only in California but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity
prices have also skyrocketed.
    Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price
caps based on the cost of generation at individual power plants.
    ``Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and
reasonable price is laughable,'' said Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican. Hard price caps
``don't work when supply is the problem. ... They make a bad
situation worse,'' he said.
    After FERC issued its limited price control order this week,
Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to
require more stringent cost-based price caps on Western electricity
sales.
    Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to
pursue a bill requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.

Anything can happen, but Hedy just talked to the Executive Offficer of the 
Senate Rules committee who told her that it is very unlikely that the full 
Senate would vote on any contempt report before the Senate leaves for recess; 
that is, they likely wouldn't vote on anything until they return in August.

Other info from the conversation:
With respect to fines, sanctions, etc., he said that "they're making it up as 
they go."
Any vote on fines, etc. would only a require a simple majority to pass.

California Stiffs Gore's Hatchet Men  

California's state controller, Democrat Kathleen Connell,  says she won't 
sign any checks for those $30,000-a-month Gore hatchet men hired  by bumbling 
Gov. Gray Davis to try to blame others for the state's energy  fiasco.  

"I would like assurance that their work is directly related to solving  
California's energy crisis and not the political strategy that [Mark] 
Fabiani  and [Chris] Lehane have built a reputation for through their work at 
the White  House," Connell said, Fox News reported today.  

Connell says she supports a lawsuit filed Monday in Sacramento by Lewis  
Uhler, president of National Tax Limitation Committee, to block "consultant"  
fees to the two former advisers to failed presidential candidate Al Gore.  

"They have a conflict of interest that may be terminal to their employment,"  
Uhler said. "These are clearly not electricity experts. Their background  
suggests they have been hired to be damage control folks for a beleaguered  
governor."

Lockyer writes a very belated letter to the LA Times---"regret" of the slimy 
variety:

My comment about introducing an energy company executive to the ugly reality 
of a prison cell was repeated recently by columnist Peter King (June 10) and 
has become fodder for commentaries that suggest I might think that prison 
rape is proper punishment for criminals. 
My anger over the activities of energy barons doesn't come close to my 
lifelong outrage at the crime of rape. As attorney general I significantly 
reordered my department's priorities in order to complete the DNA offender 
database this year. I also sponsored new laws to help fight rape crimes. My 
office prosecuted prison guards charged with encouraging inmate rapes at 
Corcoran State Prison. 
I guess I let my anger get the better of me in talking about the mercenary 
corporate executives who are making life so miserable for millions of 
Californians. I should have made my point--that even the most powerful 
corporate executives are not beyond the law--without the crude remark. 
Bill Lockyer

Richard --

We need to make some decisions very soon (this morning) about Enron's submission of data into the Pacific Northwest ("PNW") refund case.  The data is due at FERC no later than Thursday August 16.

The key strategic issues in submitting the data to the ALJ include the following --

1.	Do we exclude bookouts (ie, only physical transactions)?

It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts.  EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case.

2.	Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases?

The ALJ's Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence, our purchase would not be included in the data.  The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload.  Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence, we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases.  By having the data in the case, we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds.  This is key for Enron in that our primary defense is that Enron deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount.

3.	Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks (through 24 hours, through 7 days, through one month, through 1 year)?

The ALJ's Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of "spot" - deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of.  Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC's Order.  The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply.  In addition, it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and "determine" our trading strategies.  Weighing these risks, I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance.

4.	Do we provide data based on contract date? 

The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25, 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.  This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows. To minimize the hours on these transactions, we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions.

I will call you this morning.  

Thanks,

Jim

draft.   Incidentally, I will also be filing comments on behalf of ABAG which 
will  support the positions taken in the attached document, but I am not 
proposing  that ABAG also be a party to this filing.  Thanks for your help!   
Comments as soon as possible would be very much appreciated!

California Stiffs Gore's Hatchet Men  
California's state controller, Democrat Kathleen Connell,  says she won't sign any checks for those $30,000-a-month Gore hatchet men hired  by bumbling Gov. Gray Davis to try to blame others for the state's energy  fiasco.  
"I would like assurance that their work is directly related to solving  California's energy crisis and not the political strategy that [Mark] Fabiani  and [Chris] Lehane have built a reputation for through their work at the White  House," Connell said, Fox News reported today.  
Connell says she supports a lawsuit filed Monday in Sacramento by Lewis  Uhler, president of National Tax Limitation Committee, to block "consultant"  fees to the two former advisers to failed presidential candidate Al Gore.  
"They have a conflict of interest that may be terminal to their employment,"  Uhler said. "These are clearly not electricity experts. Their background  suggests they have been hired to be damage control folks for a beleaguered  governor."

		 Subject: Smutny Letter to Senator Dunn



June 22, 2001


The Honorable Joseph Dunn
Chair, Senate Select Committee
California State Senate
Room 2080
California State Capitol
Sacramento, CA 95814

Dear Senator Dunn:

Earlier this year, you met individually with IEP and various other parties to 
explain the purpose of the Senate Select Committee?s hearing and the process 
under which they were to be conducted.  You made it very clear that you were 
planning to have fact-finding hearings based upon fundamental fairness and 
due process.  You made a further commitment that there would be no 
surprises.  Prior to today, the hearings have been conducted consistent with 
that representation.

Unfortunately, today it appears that the Committee has set a new course that 
radically departs from these previous commitments.  Today, the Committee is 
hearing testimony from several surprise witnesses.  These witnesses are 
former employees of San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) under contract with 
Duke Energy for an interim period during which Duke Energy operated the 
facilities in San Diego.   It is our understanding that these former contract 
employees are alleging that the company failed to properly maintain these 
facilities, and they are alleging that Duke Energy cycled these facilities 
differently than the former owner, SDG&E.  It is also our understanding that 
Duke Energy will not be afforded the opportunity to contemporaneously 
challenge these allegations and/or provide an explanation as to the 
operational behavior of the facilities.  In short, the hearings are being 
reduced to a media event, giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of 
disgruntled ex-employees.

Respectfully, it would appear that the Committee has wandered far afield of 
its stated goals.  These hearings have the potential of identifying what went 
wrong with California?s energy policy and how to fix it.  However, this will 
only occur if this inquiry is based on informal facts and complete 
information, not innuendo and unsubstantiated allegations.  It is the pursuit 
of facts, not headlines, which will solve California?s energy crisis.  These 
facts will be revealed only in a fair process, where allegations made are 
subject to contemporaneous response.  

It is our hope that today?s process is an aberration, and not a departure 
from your commitments.  The Committee is at a crossroads.  It can choose to 
engage in fact-finding and analysis, or it can be reduced to a witch-hunt in 
pursuit of headlines.  For the benefit of all Californian?s, the Committee 
should focus on fact-finding and analysis.

Sincerely,



Jan Smutny-Jones
Executive Director

A March report by the Independent System Operator, which manages California=
's=20
electricity grid, alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other=20
owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in=20

Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy North America, said that varying th=
e=20
output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do=
=20
with trying to achieve higher prices.=20
He said the changes in output helped balance the state's grid by "dancing i=
n=20
the market" -- providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plan=
t=20
to add or reduce power quickly.=20
Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts la=
st=20
year as it did in 1994.=20
Olkjer served as a plant operator for 18 years, mostly when the plant was=
=20
owned by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. After Duke took over the plant, worke=
rs=20
were guaranteed their jobs for two years. In April, when that period ended,=
=20
Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers. Now he is retired.=20
During the two years Duke has managed the plant, Olkjer said, operators=20
frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing =
in=20

Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity poste=

Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant's=
=20
output up and down. When he asked, he said, company officials told him it w=
as=20
none of his business.=20
Still, he was puzzled, particularly when he was told to throttle down the=
=20
plant during electricity emergency alerts -- as he says he did Jan. 16 when=
=20
the state declared a Stage 3 alert, with the possibility of rolling=20
blackouts.=20
"It doesn't make sense to cycle up and down when there's a Stage 3 alert," =
he=20
said.=20
Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders =
of=20
the ISO during a Stage 3 alert because the grid manager can find cheaper=20
power somewhere else.=20
Lisa Szot, spokeswoman at the ISO, said she couldn't determine whether the=
=20
ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan. 16.=20
Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production, which sometimes=
=20
occurred every half-hour, wear out the plant's equipment.=20
"It's harder on the machinery," he said. "It's like driving down the street=
=20
putting your (foot) on the gas and then slamming on the brake."=20
Before deregulation, Olkjer said, the four units at Chula Vista, which have=
=20
the capacity to produce 706 megawatts, had been operated steadily during mu=
ch=20
of their history.=20
S. David Freeman, formerly general manager of Los Angeles' Department of=20
Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov. Gray Davis, said rapid=
=20
cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment.=
=20
"We had almost 15,000 megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last=
=20
winter," said Freeman, referring to what industry experts agreed was an=20
extraordinary level of plant outages over several months.=20
SDG&E, which built the Chula Vista plant in the 1960s, sold it to the Port=
=20
District for $110 million. In 1998 the port leased the plant to Duke Energy=
=20
for 101/2 years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal.=20
The company pays minimal rent, but has made large profits. In the first=20
quarter of this year, Duke, which owns three other plants in California, sa=
id=20
profits rose 208 percent to $428 million from energy sales and trading.=20
Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity. It=
=20
asked $3,880 per megawatt-hour this year. By comparison, before the energy=
=20
crisis began, electricity sold for around $35 per megawatt-hour, an amount=
=20
which powers about 750 homes.=20
Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund $20 million to the=20
state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them.=20
In May, the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging=20
investigations, but Gov. Gray Davis declined.=20
Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr., who worked at the plant for 20 years before bein=
g=20
laid off in April, said they couldn't understand why Duke ran the=20
inefficient, high-cost turbine unit during the past year while other=20
generators sat idle.=20
They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price=
=20
for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran.=20
Williams, the Duke spokesman, said the opposite was true. He said Duke ran=
=20
the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive. It ran on=
=20
jet fuel, which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units.=
=20
Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed.=20
"It ran so frequently and so hard, it needed extensive repairs," he said.=

Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were=20

Estimates of Power Profits Disputed=20
Electricity: A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed, state=20
officials say. Davis quoted the figures to Congress.=20

By DOUG SMITH, ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers=20

?????Gov. Gray Davis' contention that California has been nicked for billio=
ns=20
of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state=20
officials concede may have significant flaws, according to interviews and=
=20
confidential government documents.
?????Those costs--estimated by the state to be as high as $9 billion--were=
=20
central to Davis' testimony this week before a U.S. Senate committee, where=
=20
he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to "give =
us=20
back the money that was wrongly taken from us."
?????The governor's impassioned demand, however, was based on shaky=20
calculations. The formulas are being reworked, said Charles Robinson, vice=
=20
president of California's grid operator, which prepared the study.
?????Robinson said he "had no idea" how much the amount allegedly overcharg=
ed=20
by the generators might change. For now, he said, the agency stands by the=
=20
numbers.
?????But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator=
=20
warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged=20
excess profits could be well off the mark.
?????What's more, the documents caution against relying on the agency's stu=
dy=20
as a basis for allegations of overcharging--as Davis did during his testimo=
ny=20
Wednesday. That warning was particularly important because the documents=20
provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy=20
supplier prospered from the state's power troubles between last summer and=
=20
February.
?????The largest amounts were charged by four out-of-state power companies,=
=20
according to the confidential Cal-ISO report. Okalhoma-based Williams Cos.=
=20
led the group with $860 million, followed by Duke Energy with $805 million,=
=20
Southern Company Energy Marketing (now Mirant) with $754 million and Relian=
t=20
Energy Services with $750 million.
?????When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them, executives o=
f=20
the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of=20
Cal-ISO's poor methodology.
?????Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company's entire energy earnings=
=20
for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping=20
unfairly in California.
?????"It doesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding up," Williams said=
.=20
"What [Cal-ISO] has done is highly irresponsible math."
?????Paula Hall-Collins, a Williams Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm would=
=20
need to study the ISO report further. But generally, she said, such reports=
=20
fail to fully account for electricity production costs.
?????"We maintain that we have not overcharged, and that we have operated=
=20
legally."
?????Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures, saying=
,=20
"There's a lot of misinformation out of there."
?????A Mirant spokesman said: "We haven 't overcharged. We haven't=20
manipulated. We haven't withheld."=20
?????Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree we=
re=20
outraged.
?????Joe Ronan, vice president for government and regulatory relations at=
=20
Calpine, said the $236 million attributed to his company "doesn't bear any=
=20
relation to reality."
?????"Anybody can throw out any number," he said. "It's like McCarthyism. .=
 .=20
. Where is the evidence?"
?????A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimat=
e=20
but defended it as reasonable.
?????"It's no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute =
an=20
estimate of how much they're gouging us," senior advisor Nancy McFadden sai=
d.
?????Despite the cautions expressed in the Cal-ISO documents, officials=20
Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the=
=20
agency's figures as potential overcharges.=20
?????"The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a=20
competitive benchmark," said Robinson, who is also Cal-ISO's general counse=
l.
?????The first version of the now-disputed Cal-ISO study was made public in=
=20
March. It estimated that power sellers earned $6.3 billion in excess profit=
s=20
between May 2000 and last February. The report, later revised upward to $6.=
7=20
billion, became a crucial element of the Davis Administration's campaign=20
against alleged electricity price gougers.
?????This week, just before Davis' appearance in Congress, the study was=20
updated again, adding another $2.2 billions in alleged excess profits throu=
gh=20
May.
?????The orginal study, which did not include actual pricing data, was most=
ly=20
intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generator=

Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant=20
Power: Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision. The site is=20
proposed as a 1,200-acre state park.=20

By JOE MOZINGO, Times Staff Writer=20

?????In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners, an energy=20
company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power=
=20
plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills.=20
?????La Jolla Energy Development Inc., in a letter to the state Energy=20
Commission, said it was withdrawing its application for fast-track approval=
=20
of the 53-megawatt plant and "will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the=
=20
future."
?????"We listened to the community," La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said =
in=20
an interview Thursday. "We need to find another place for this equipment."
?????The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker=20
Resources, an oil company that leases the land where the trailer-sized=20
natural-gas plant would sit.
?????Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether=
=20
they will pursue the project. "At this point it's just La Jolla pulling out=
,"=20
Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said.
?????But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the=
=20
fast-track schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis.
?????The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the=20
project today in Sacramento, but the hearing has been canceled.
?????The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners=
=20
who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods=
=20
and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together 1,200 acres of public open=
=20
space in the hills.
?????"We're getting ready to have the biggest party," said Tony Nicholas,=
=20
president of the hills' United Homeowners Assn. "This shows how a community=
=20
can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of=
=20
days."
?????About 76% of the residents in the hills are African American and many=
=20
saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice.=20
?????In addition, Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant=
=20
within 21 days of filing their application, under the governor's emergency=
=20
power orders. By following this fast-tracked procedure, they would have bee=
n=20
able to avoid the normal, time-consuming environmental review process.
?????That angered opponents even further, and nearly 1,000 people showed up=
=20
at a public hearing Monday to fight the project.
?????But what officials said turned the tide against the project--at a time=
=20
when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possible--wa=
s=20
testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his=
=20
agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly.
?????Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to=20
conduct hearings that would take up to 60 days, pushing construction well=
=20
beyond a Sept. 30 deadline set by the governor for fast-track projects. He=
=20
also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal=
=20
clean air laws.
?????In a letter to the Energy Commission this week, Wallerstein wrote: "It=
=20
appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until so=
me=20
time in the first part of 2002 at the earliest." By Wednesday night, the=20
energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statemen=
t=20
recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a=20
plant, citing Wallerstein's concerns.
?????Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to=
=20
create a park was gaining steam. The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created=
=20
last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated=
=20
neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. With support from the governor and loca=
l=20
politicians, the state recently bought a 68-acre parcel in the area for an=
=20
unprecedented $41 million.
?????"This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have=
=20
worked so hard to bring this world-class vision to reality," said Esther=20
Feldman, president of Community Conservancy International and the main=20
organizer to build the park.
?????Also applauding La Jolla's decision were state Sen. Kevin Murray=20
(D-Culver City) and Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who had come o=
ut=20
strongly against the project. They and others questioned whether the small=
=20
amount of power provided by the facility--coming online after the dog days =
of=20
summer--would do much to relieve the energy crisis.
?????"I'm ecstatic" Wesson said. "At this point the environment has won."
?????The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about 650 feet=
=20
from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. And according to park=20
proponents, it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy, on=
=20
what would be a half-mile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard.
?????Rusch, the spokesman for Stocker, said much of the information=20
circulating about the trailer-sized plant is false.
?????The plan did not call for "a stack with billowing smoke," he said. "If=
=20
the issue is air quality, we've cleaned air quality up." In the last decade=
,=20
Rusch said, the company's existing 400 oil pumps on the property have reduc=
ed=20
nitrogen oxide emissions from 374 tons to 3 tons a year. The power=20
plant--with two 70-foot stacks--would ultimately add about 18 tons a year.
?????He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing it=
s=20
own power to pump oil, while also contributing an extra 39 megawatts to the=
=20
state grid during the energy crisis.
?????Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve=
=20
the energy problem. Said Mary Ann Green, president of the Blair Hills=20
Homeowners Assn.: "We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the=20
outcry from the community."

As state legislators consider Gov. Gray Davis' deal to buy part of the powe=
r=20
grid in California, a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterd=
ay=20
demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of=20
living near high-voltage transmission lines.=20
The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the $2.76 billion de=
al=20
to buy Southern California Edison's power lines, said Terry Francke, genera=
l=20
counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, which filed the lawsu=
it=20
in Alameda County Superior Court. The power line deal was brokered by the=
=20
governor to help the cash-strapped utility.=20
Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug. 15 or the utility=
=20
can back out. Davis also has a $1 billion agreement to purchase San Diego G=
as=20
and Electric's power grid, which also would require the Legislature's=20
approval.=20
Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines.=20
The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and=20
Magnetic Fields Program, an agency set up by the state Department of Health=
=20
Services to study the issue, Francke said. Both state agencies and their=20
directors are named in the lawsuit.=20
Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect, Francke said.=20
"If it's known there's some danger . . . do you want the state owning that=
=20
liability?" he asked.=20
The study began in 1993 after the state Public Utilities Commission committ=
ed=20
$7.2 million for research and education on the subject, Francke said.=20
The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and=20
electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies=
=20
based on those findings, he said.=20
The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May 7, but "at the=
=20
last minute, the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staf=
f=20
of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret," the lawsuit said.=20
State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only =
a=20
draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC.=20
"The PUC wanted to see the draft before (it is released)," she said. "We=20
prepared (the report) for them. We are following their request."=20
Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit, saying her office hadn't seen it. PU=
C=20
officials were not available for comment.=20
Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consens=
us=20
on their effects, Francke said. That's what makes the state study important=
=20
for legislators to consider before voting on the governor's deal to buy=20
transmission lines, he said.=20
Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to=
=20
Davis' agreements with the utilities. Some legislators would rather the sta=

There's trouble in Texas.=20
Enron Corp., the Houston power firm that's profited mightily during=20

Wall Street.=20

Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston=
=20
boys' reversal of fortunes. But what gives? Isn't this the company that was=
=20
fattening up on the backs of the state's beleaguered utilities, residents a=
nd=20
state budget? Isn't this the company with such close ties to the Bush=20
administration that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, was reported to have=20
interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his=20
company?=20
Yup. That Enron.=20
On Monday, Enron shares hit a 52-week low of $43.07, after the Federal Ener=
gy=20
Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power=20
marketers such as Enron that had applied to power-generating companies for=
=20
months. That's a far cry from August, when the company's shares peaked at=
=20
$90.=20
"There's a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with=
=20
in the marketplace right now, none of which on the surface is a major deal,=
"=20
said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in=
=20
Houston. "But when you combine them all . . . I think what's happening here=
=20
is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement. You have people saying=
,=20
'OK, the growth rate is now in question.' "=20
That growth rate was an eye-popping 88.82 percent in revenues for the Unite=
d=20
States on a two-year average, and nearly 98 percent in the rest of the worl=
d.=20
Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews, but as the sto=
ck=20
continued to drop Tuesday morning, chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a=
=20
statement to the markets in which he reiterated "strong confidence" in its=
=20
earnings guidance. The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week, closin=
g=20
at $44.05 yesterday.=20
In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night, Skilling blamed regulatory=
=20
interference with the "free market" for investor flight from his company.=
=20
"Our stock prices have gotten hammered," he said. "They're half what they=
=20
were a year ago."=20
Tumbling stock prices weren't the only bad news for Skilling last night. A=
=20
protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began=20
speaking. As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face, a=20
woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges.=20
Enron isn't the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with=
=20
California's power crisis and are now suddenly headed south. Shares of=20
Reliant Energy Inc., AES Inc. and Williams Companies Inc., which generate a=
nd=20
sell electricity in California, and El Paso Energy Corp., which sells natur=
al=20
gas here, are all trading near 52-week lows.=20
The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington abou=
t=20
power price controls, re-regulation and now, the possibility of big refunds=
=20
being ordered for California. Even Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which has=20
developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played th=
e=20
spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics, dropped nearl=
y=20
7 percent yesterday, to $37.10. But none of the companies has been hit as=
=20
hard as Enron.=20
Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any=
=20
company. It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth, and because=
=20
executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price, a sharp decline=
=20
makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders.=20
While Enron's power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine, the firm h=
as=20
been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regio=
ns=20
in recent months. In the financial press, the continuing knock on Enron is=
=20
that its business lines are so new and complex, and the company is so=20
secretive about its operations, that analysts and fund managers don't feel=
=20
confident in their understanding of what it does.=20
A look at the firm's recent troubles exemplifies its diversity.=20
For instance, Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state governme=
nt=20
of Maharashtra in India over a 2,184-megawatt power plant there. The Dahbol=
=20
Power Co., which is 65 percent controlled by Enron, stopped construction on=
 a=20
second phase of the project on Sunday, claiming it is owed $48 million by t=
he=20
Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The state has accused Enron of chargin=
g=20
too much and not generating enough, and stopped buying power from the plant=
=20
last month.=20
Closer to home, Enron has struggled with its investments in fiber-optic=20
bandwidth. The company buys and sells unused, high-speed bandwidth space,=
=20
treating it like a commodity as it does electricity, coal or natural gas. B=
ut=20
the fiber-optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear=
=20
that for all the long-distance cable laid in the ground, there have not bee=
n=20
enough "last mile" connections set up for users to actually take advantage =
of=20
it. Earlier this year, Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with=20
Blockbuster to offer what it called "video on demand," in which customers a=
t=20
home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it=
=20
transmitted via fiber-optic cables.=20
Then there was the FERC ruling. For months, the agency had resisted=20
aggressive price controls in the West, preferring to let the market run its=
=20
course. But as control of the U.S. Senate was handed to Democrats this mont=
h=20
and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III=
=20
to the commission, the agency changed its tune. It expanded price controls =
to=20
all hours of the day, spread the controls throughout the Western region and=
=20
brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent.=20
So under current calculations, that means Enron could sell power for no mor=
e=20
than $108 per megawatt in a shortage and about $90 during normal hours -- f=
ar=20
short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging=20
during the past year.=20
In part, the company's gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of=
=20
the businesses Enron has decided to pursue. And the hard-charging company h=
as=20
a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets. But sometime=
s=20
that approach gets it in trouble, as was the case last year, when Enron had=
=20
to take a $400 million charge for its failed investment in Azurix, a global=
=20
water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same=
=20
way it had done for electricity service, as governments privatized their=20
water systems. The opportunities never materialized.=20
Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a price-earnings=
=20
ratio of nearly 39, considerably above the liberal standard of health, whic=
h=20
is 25. The company had less than $1 billion in profits on more than $100=20
billion in revenues last year. Still, a survey by Thomson Financial/First=
=20
Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of 42 cents per=
=20
share in the second quarter (up from 34 cents last year), and $1.79 per sha=
re=20
on the year. Most maintain a strong "buy" rating on the stock.=20
But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit. Hardest-put of=
=20
them will be the Janus funds, which, as Enron's largest mutual fund investo=
r,=20
held nearly $3.33 billion of its stock as of the end of April.=20
In a semiannual report to investors, John Schreiber, a portfolio manager,=

said the stock price of the "new-age energy merchant" was a victim of=20
negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis. Janus=20

that helped drive up electricity prices during the state's energy crisis.=
=20
The workers say they will offer eyewitness testimony to a state Senate=20

ow=20
energy production may have been manipulated.=20
Duke officials deny most of the allegations. The whistle-blowers - mechanic=
s=20
Ed Edwards and Glenn Johnson and control room operator Jimmy Olkjer - lost=
=20
their jobs four months ago.=20
State Sen. Joe Dunn, the Santa Ana Democrat who is chairing the investigati=
ve=20
committee on price-fixing, said his staff will attempt to verify the accoun=
ts=20
from the whistle-blowers. But their mere presence in a Capitol hearing room=
=20
is expected to set off a media circus. And if the accusations are true, it=
=20
could have wide-ranging effects on the North Carolina company's operations =
in=20
California. Duke officials were working late into the night to prepare for=
=20
the hearing and have scheduled a news conference later today.=20
"They were doing all kinds of things that didn't make sense," Johnson said =
in=20
an interview. "But if you asked them why, to explain, they told you to shut=
=20
up and do your job."=20
The testimony comes on the heels of a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission=
=20
ruling Thursday ordering Duke to refund $10 million in overcharges for=20
January 2001.=20
"This information lends credence to the concern that there was a deliberate=
=20
strategy for outages for the sole purpose of impacting price," Dunn said.=
=20
"What they are saying is disturbing."=20
Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said the fact that the former workers lo=
st=20
their jobs may be shaping their testimony.=20
"The proof is in the pudding. Production is up and we've had fewer forced=
=20
outages since we've taken over,'' said Williams.=20
But control-room logs obtained by The Orange County Register show Duke's=20
trading arm ordered its South Bay power plant in Chula Vista to reduce=20
production minutes after Stage Three alerts were issued. The logs are for=
=20
January 2001 - the same month that Duke was accused of overcharging in=20
California.=20
The three former Duke workers each worked at the Chula Vista plant for more=
=20
than two decades when it was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. They lost=
=20
their jobs when Duke assembled a new team to run the plant.=20
The three whistle-blowers outlined their accusations in interviews with the=
=20
Register. The accusations include:=20
The company ordered workers to throw unopened boxes of bolts, steam seals,=
=20
valves and other parts into Dumpsters. The parts were needed to perform=20
routine maintenance but were no longer available when repairs were required=
.=20
Duke officials acknowledge that new parts were discarded, but say the high=
=20
inventory tax made it more efficient to order parts as needed because they=
=20
could be delivered within 24 hours.=20
Edwards and Johnson say they were ordered to dismantle critical equipment=
=20
necessary for the generating units to run at full capacity. Because parts=
=20
were thrown away, they couldn't make repairs and generators ran at diminish=
ed=20
capacity for days or weeks. Energy experts say this allegation, if true,=20
would allow Duke to withhold energy from the marketplace, which could drive=
=20
up the price. Duke officials counter that production has increased at its=
=20
power plants and forced outages have decreased since they took over. But in=
=20
late 2000, there was a spike in outages at the Chula Vista plant, according=
=20
to records kept by the state's power-grid operator. The plant reported 3,00=
0=20
hours of outages from October through December. There were relatively few=
=20
outages before that.=20
The mechanics say the inability to perform repairs forced them to use a=20
small, expensive generator that was rarely powered up before Duke took over=
=20
the plant. Experts say that could have been used to exploit federal rules=
=20
allowing generators to justify prices based on the costliest units online.=
=20
Olkjer says he received orders from Duke's trading arm to reduce production=
.=20
Then, when energy prices jumped, he would get new instructions to power up=
=20
again. Duke officials did not respond to Olkjer's claim.=20
Stanford professor Frank Wolak, an expert in California's energy market, sa=
id=20
that if their testimony can be proven, the state could be refunded millions=
=20
of dollars and future energy prices could be dramatically reduced.=20
"What they are saying is amazing. This is a classic plot. I've always=20
wondered how they kept the generators out for so long,'' said Wolak, who=20
heads an electricity market surveillance for the California agency that=20
oversees the buying and selling of power. "They were very happy to have the=
m=20
off-line because it allowed them to make more money.=20
Wolak said the testimony seems to back up research conducted by the state=
=20
Independent System Operator, which runs most of the state's power grid and=
=20
oversees the buying and selling of electricity in California.=20
In a report to federal regulators, ISO said that from May to November 2000,=
=20
Duke withheld electricity from the state's power grid 80 percent of the tim=
e.=20
The report accused more than a dozen power plant companies of powering down=
=20
generators to create scarcity in the marketplace that would in turn drive u=
p=20
prices.=20
In a separate report, the state power grid operator accused Duke of=20
overcharging California again in January of this year, resulting in the $10=
=20
million refund order. Duke officials say charging $3,880 a megawatt-hour wa=
s=20
justified during a short period of time. Federal regulators disagreed and=
=20
said the power merchant should have charged no more than $273 per=20
megawatt-hour.=20
Williams, Duke's spokesman, said that the company has been an ethical=20
operator.=20
"All but 1.1 percent of the time, we were operating. That's very good,'' sa=
id=20
Williams, adding that when SDG&E owned the plant forced outages took place=
=20
1.8 percent of the time.=20
But Dunn said that if the testimony from the whistle-blowers is true, and=
=20
Duke had the ability to manipulate prices, federal regulators would be=20
required under the Federal Power Act to move them out of the competitive=20
marketplace.=20
This would mean they would be moved back into a "cost-based" market structu=

and would only be allowed to recover costs at a fair rate of return.=20
"This would bring the prices down dramatically in California,'' Dunn said.=

The Orange County Register=20

And he wants that money back.=20

"They must be required to give us back our money,'' Davis told the Senate=

=20
It was the first time California's chief executive has testified on the=20
state's crisis. "It is unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while=
=20
energy companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion."=20
The $9 billion is the amount California's Independent System Operator says=
=20
generators overcharged utilities and the state from May 2000 to May of this=
=20
year. It had initially calculated that between May 2000 and February 2001=
=20
there were $6.7 billion in overcharges, Davis said. Those figures are a far=
=20
cry from the $124 million that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission say=

were overcharges. That's because FERC only looked at three months of rates=

If they can't, the administrative judge overseeing the talks will make a=20

Not surprisingly, generators don't see the refund issue the governor's way.=

"It's just crazy," said Tom Williams, a spokesman at Duke Energy. "I don't=

And there's skepticism about next week's talks.=20
"The negotiations are going to be like the SALT Treaty," said Gary Ackerman=
,=20
president of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents power=20
suppliers. "I question whether it can happen and work out."=20
Also at issue is money generators say they are owed by the utilities. Davis=
=20
said that's about $2.5 billion. But power companies say it's more like $5.5=
=20
billion to $6.5 billion.=20
Whatever the figure, Davis said, "we want to see their money in our pockets=
=20
before we talk about working anything out on their end."=20
The settlement conference was part of FERC's order instituting=20
around-the-clock price caps for California and its 10 Western neighbors.=20
Those price caps were made possible, experts agree, because California=20

=20
Because I'm an N001. And the dirty little secret about rolling power=20
blackouts is how many of us are out there.=20
Allow me to explain.=20
As you may have heard, Southern California Edison has been required to set =
up=20
a public notification system for rolling blackouts. If you hear on the news=
=20
that the power guys are expecting rolling blackouts, you can go to a Web si=
te=20
(www.sce.com) or call a toll-free phone number (800-611-1911) to see if you=
r=20
"rotating outage group" is on the list for going temporarily dark.=20
How do you know which group you're in? On your Edison power bill, next to=
=20
your account number, there's a code that starts with A or M - A001, A002,=
=20
M001, M002 and so on. That's your outage group number.=20
But wait. There's another category of outage group. If your power bill has=
=20
the code number N001 on it, it means that you're exempt from rolling=20
blackouts.=20
You see, under Public Utilities Commission rules, electric power customers=
=20
who provide "essential public health, safety and security services" - such =
as=20
fire and police stations, hospitals, jails and so on - are automatically=20
exempt from rolling blackouts, even if they have emergency generators on=20

For example, my house shares a circuit with a fire station. So I'm an exemp=

But here's the kicker: According to an Edison spokesman, 50 percent of all=

Edison customers are N001s - that is, they share circuits with essential=20
service providers, and thus are currently exempt from rolling blackouts.=20
Let me repeat that: Half of all Edison customers are exempt from rolling=20
blackouts. (For San Diego Gas & Electric customers it's 40 percent.)=20
Mind you, this isn't something Edison likes to publicize. When I asked abou=

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
? Multiple MOU Plans Debated
? California State Budget Faces One Last Hurdle

Budget 
There is a small possibility that Sen. Burton will not recess the Senate on 
Thursday unless the Senate passes the budget that the Assembly passed last 
night (7-17). However a key Democrat, Sen. Sheila Kuehl, has been is in Italy 
and is on a 16 hour return flight. No one knows if she has been told to 
return and without her presence, two Republican votes are still needed to 
pass any urgency measure for the budget.  Kuehl's vote is crucial if they 
take the bill up on Thursday. 
MOU Mayhem
There are currently three leading MOU plans being resuscitated by the 
California House and Senate deliberations.  Senator Burton is hoping to keep 
the published schedule and adjourn for a month's recess on Thursday evening.  
Speaker Hertzberg is reportedly not thrilled with leaving until the Edison 
issue is resolved.  However, rumor is that whether or not they recess on 
Thursday, their adjournment will mark the end of the Second Extraordinary 
session and all XX  bills passed and signed will go into effect in 90 days 
(all others will be dead).  Although Davis has stressed the urgency of 
passing a comprehensive "bail-out" plan and even threatened to call an 
emergency session to prevent legislators from taking a 30-day recess on 
Friday, there is no clear indication that legislators will comply with this 
request.      
? Hertzberg's bill 82XX - Of the more obvious differences from Davis MOU,  
82XX proposes to offer SoCal $300 M less for its transmission lines in 
addition to penalizing Edison if it fails to act in good faith in closing the 
deal.  It comes as no surprise that during bill deliberations, SoCal raised 
objections to the bill and warned of impending difficulties (bankruptcy) for 
So Cal were the bill left unamended.
? The Wright-Richman bill 83XX - We reported last week that 83XX remains the 
only measure fueled by bipartisan support.  AB 83XX was heard in an 
"informational" hearing yesterday (7-17) and will be heard again today in the 
Assembly Energy Committee.  Assemblyman Rod Wright, the Chairman of the 
Committee, presented AB 83xx with Dr. Keith Richman, a Republican Assemblyman 
from Southern California. They offered 83XX as an Edison bail-out, pure and 
simple. Wright was clear to distinguish his bill from 82XX, which he said has 
conservation easements and land requisitions, a renewable portfolio which 
will add an additional fee on ratepayers, and reasonable review for long term 
contracts. While the chances of the Richman bill being successful appear 
slim, reports that that Hertzberg will try to negotiate elements of his own 
bill (82XX) as amendments to the Wright/Richman measure suggest that at least 
Hertzberg feels Richman's 83XX stands a chance. 

? The Byron Sher bill, SB 78XX (Polanco) - Previously presented by Sen. 
Polanco on behalf of Governor Davis, SB 78XX has received special attention 
from Senate President, John Burton.  Although it has never been heard by a 
committee, SB 78XX is currently on the Senate floor and ready for a vote. The 
Senate Energy Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee are both 
scheduled to have informational hearings on this bill today.  Note, the 
meetings are informational because neither committee has possession of the 
bill.  These hearings will provide information to committee members, avoid a 
formal vote, and simultaneously shield Burton/Polanco from claims that the 
details of SB78XX were never released.  The Senate is scheduled to be in 
session tomorrow, ostensibly to vote on the state budget and SB 78XX. Given 
Burton's penchant for wanting to keep on schedule to recess tomorrow, there 
is no guarantee that he will hold the Senate in session once they hear SB 
78XX. Thus, the Senate may never even see AB 82XX and AB 83XX unless either 
or both bills are passed out of the Assembly today and get special treatment 
by Burton to be heard tomorrow. Burton has previously adjourned the Senate to 
keep on schedule once they finish their business, even if the Assembly is 
behind them.

Just got this. She is taking a harder line that Sen Dunn did yesterday. I'll 
wait to hear from them on the nonwaiver agreement. I'll find out what 
happened at today's meeting of the generators and Sen Dunn

Mike,

Attached are the Select Committee's Confidentiality Agreement and Document
Depository Protocol.  As Senator Dunn reiterated a number of times during
the hearing and meeting with you, the three conditions for compliance are
that Enron sign the attached confidentiality agreement, sign the attached
document depository protocol and deposit into the depository documents
responsive to the Select Committee's priority list of 16 document
categories.  These 3 conditions remain the same.  The Select Committee does
not agree to enter into a "protective order."  The attached confidentiality
agreement is intended to be just that and not "an outline for a proposed
protective order."

The Senator and Larry Drivon will review your proposed nonwaiver agreement
and get back to you on that after they have had a chance to do so.

Should you wish to discuss this further, please feel free to call Larry
Drivon at (916) 445-5831.

Alexandra
(916) 445-5831
