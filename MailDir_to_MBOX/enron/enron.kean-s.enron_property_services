Steve - 

Here's a quick run down on activities from last week:

Enron Center:
Working with Clark and Hines to establish consensus on estimated 
"floor-by-floor" occupancy schedule, given present progress of base building 
work.
Received subcontractor bids on tenant improvements, levels 3-9.  Bids are 
very competitive and within budget targets.
Established bi-weekly meetings with Phillipe and IT team to co-ordinate 
responsibilities, schedules, and budgets.
Setting up "trading desk" mock-ups/competition between leading furniture 
makers.  Selection Committee involves top executives from ENA, EGM, and 
Networks.
Meeting with EES to discuss contractual relationship with Corp. for energy 
infrastructure management of Enron Center when operational next year
Working with Global Strategic Sourcing and Enron's "DealBench" team to buy 
Enron Center's carpet, lights, and ceiling system through their "reverse 
auction" internet platform.

EI Asset Sale:  "On hold" pending word from Corp. Development.  Issues 
outstanding include 3AC office space and corporate aircraft.  We are also 
holding on sublease with Azurix for their 3AC space, should EI's space needs 
impact Azurix.

We are cancelling our contract with Barton, our present Enron Building's 
outsourced security company.  Replacement vendor, Wackenhut, is on site with 
transition team.

Met with Bob McClaren of the Astros.  Purpose was to explore Enron's interest 
in development opportunities around Enron Field, given their present 
disposition to ask us to not build the proposed garage.

Executed the purchase agreement for the Williams Hanger @ Intercontinental.  
Have initiated inspections and due diligence efforts before closing next 
month.

EGEP's move to 3AC is locked in for this coming weekend.  Have been very 
co-operative since their inclusion in the EI Asset deal.  Subsequent 
construction of EB levels 17 and 18, for Tax and IT, will begin immediately 
with EGEP's move.  All present demands for office space are being met or will 
be satisfied as we execute agreed to master plan. 

- Bill
