Larry,

Please give me a report following your fly-over of the route with Doug 
Cebryk.  I am very interested in what you see and the potentials that are 
there.  Don't forget to take your camera.  Pictures (slides) would be most 
helpful as we work through the early planning stages for the greenfield 
portion.  As the primary route begins to solidify with alternates, we will 
need to develop some preliminary maps.  It is my understanding that no maps 
of the route will be released with sign-off from the entire group of: Hyatt, 
Taylor, Veatch and Shafer.

After we receive the "fatal-flaw" desk-top analysis from ENSR (Sept. 21 - 
although I hope to get it sooner), I would offer that several events should 
be scheduled to expedite the project as follows:
1. If the open season reflects that we have a project and Eric Gadd approves, 
a couple of quick meetings will be held with strategic groups to discuss the 
project potential (TNC, State Land Managing agencies, US Forest Service, 
etc).  These strategic groups will be identified by the ENSR fatal-flaw 
analysis.
2. Simultaneously, we will begin working with ENSR (if the open season 
reflects that we have a project) on developing a full scoped Environmental 
Strategy for Sun Devil (this will include an RFP that will immediately go out 
soliciting bids for the Resource Reports and permits). 
3. We will work with Steve Veatch and Joe Hartso to schedule a meeting with 
the FERC Staff (we need the commitment of the State Land Managing Agencies, 
US Forest Service, etc. to collaborate with the FERC on the NEPA review) to 
introduce the project and solicit their commitment to offer staff resources 
early in the process.
4. We will also need to develop a Public Relations and Government Affairs 
strategy which will identify the early meetings that need to be held with 
local, state, federal jurisdictional governing bodies and politicians - so 
the right folks have a heads-up on the project before it hits the news 
media.  This also includes developing a strategy on where and when the 
project will formally be announced (i.e., news conference in Phoenix or 
Houston, etc.).  A $580 Million project will be a big deal in the Phoenix 
area and for the Southwest.

I know there is more, but this will help to keep some of the early events 
coordinated.  John Shafer

Larry, per our phone conversation tonight.  I found this article interesting, 
especially in light of potential future expansions on TW.  Note the section 
below in bold Red text.  Camp Navajo is nearly due South of Station 2 just 
across Interstate 40 and as you know, Kachina Village is South of Flagstaff 
off Interstate 15.  This may or may not pose any direct threats to TW ROW's 
but, it does give us a flavor of public sentiment with regards to conserving 
these areas.....   Anyhow, fyi...  (Oh yea, The Grand Canyon Trust & The 
Nature Conservancy in Flagstaff share the same office building)  



New land pegged for preservation


By ANNE MINARD
Sun Staff Reporter
07/29/2001

Reader Comments

It's been less than a year since Arizona voters narrowly
rejected Proposition 100, a plan to protect 290,000
acres of State Trust Land from development.
And in about a month, voters could be asked to begin
signing petitions to get another initiative on the
ballot that would protect significantly more of the
state's legacy -- 1 million acres, or about 10 percent,
including thousands of acres in and around Flagstaff.

The difference, conservationists say, is that this land
has been chosen with the goal of protecting biologically
and aesthetically important areas. The environmental
community rallied against Prop. 100 because they said
the lands chosen for protection were insufficient and
had little value for conservation.

For example, the Proposition 100 campaign identified 10
acres of Rio De Flag in east Flagstaff -- near a
wastewater treatment plant outflow -- as one of the
state's "crown jewels" needing to be preserved.

Two other parcels in the Flagstaff area included 15
acres on Wildcat Hill with an unimpressive view of an
industrial park and 269 acres of steep slopes littered
with shot-up refrigerators and television sets called
Turkey Hills.

Rogers Lake, an important wetland and major ecosystem
south of Flagstaff, was also slated for preservation
under Prop 100. But that plan only included its soggy
lakebed, while 2,000 acres of highly developable
shoreline owned by the State Trust Land Department was
still up for grabs.

THE NEW PLAN

The new initiative would include all areas around Rogers
Lake, excluding those that are private or held by the
U.S. Forest Service. One proposed parcel does still fall
in the Turkey Hills area, and three others lie between
Flagstaff proper and Walnut Canyon (not included is
Section 20, which is likely to be sold and developed,
but at densities that are still in dispute between the
county and the city).

Other areas would include parcels around Observatory
Mesa (a contiguous chunk of land south and west of the
Naval Observatory) and a checkerboard pattern of
sections -- interspersed with Forest Service land --
south of Camp Navajo and west of Kachina Village and
Griffiths Spring.

Like Prop. 100, an initiative would be only a first
step. If it were to appear on the ballot and then pass,
it would take an act of Congress, and a constitutional
amendment, to change the availability of State Trust
Lands.

State Trust Lands include about 135 million acres across
the country -- 9.3 million in Arizona -- originally
allocated by the federal government when each state was
formed to help fund public schools. (See related story
on Page A11.)

Brad Ack, program director for the Flagstaff-based Grand
Canyon Trust who is helping spearhead the initiative,
said the state's schools shouldn't be bought and paid
for with proceeds from unmanaged sprawl. Areas set aside
under the initiative could still be leased for grazing,
agriculture or other current uses -- but they would
never be sold for commercial development.

Making an informed decision to set aside designated
State Trust Lands will free others from the battles that
now accompany proposals to develop them, he said.

The initiative is a collaborative effort between the
Grand Canyon Trust and other conservation groups, along
with some business and development affiliates.

And supporters are touting a recent poll conducted by
the Grand Canyon Trust, the Sonoran Institute in Tucson
and the Nature Conservancy that showed 88 percent of
Arizona voters agreed that some of Arizona's State Trust
Land should be conserved.

TALKING COMPENSATION

But members of the State Department of Lands charged
with managing the tracts -- and a lobbyist for
superintendents and principals in the state's school
system -- say the initiative backers are missing the
mark in the state land debate.

"We have a fundamental difference of opinion with our
friends in the environmental community," said Mike
Smith, a contract lobbyist for the Arizona School
Administrator Association. "Preserve, set aside ... we
think those are great ideas. The question is
compensation. Those State Trust Lands are in trust for
the schools. It's acutely important for schools to
maximize the returns on state lands."

Smith acknowledged that the awareness of their legacy is
new for the state's schools. Until recently, the schools
didn't see a whole lot of benefit from the state trusts.

"We haven't seen any of it. The state Legislature has
taken the annual earnings, and has used it to reduce
state aid coming out of the general fund."

That all changed with the passage of Proposition 301,
passed last year, he said.

"In addition to increasing sales tax for the schools ...
they also said, 'By the way, all new earnings from the
state trust fund go into the school site fund.' All of a
sudden, it's real different for us. Before it supplanted
our funding, now it will supplement it. It's real money
to us."

The Legislature will still keep the money it has been
earning from State Trust Lands -- about $80 million a
year. But anything above that mark will now go to the
schools, and both Smith and Nick Simonetta, manager of
communications and legislative affairs for the Arizona
Department of Lands, are optimistic that figure will
climb rapidly in the coming years. Simonetta estimates
the schools could see $650 million in addition to
legislative appropriations over the next decade.

LOOKING BACK

But the past irregularities are a stronghold for
conservationists who are promoting the land reform
initiative.

In background literature for its State Trust Land Reform
Initiative, the Grand Canyon Trust says that the State
Trust Lands haven't been used as they were intended
anyway, and very little money has gone to Arizona
schools.

"State Trust Lands currently provide less than 2 percent
of the annual funding for public education," the
document reads. "... there is little, if any, direct
benefit from State Trust Lands to our public schools."

Simonetta said he strongly disagrees with that
assessment.

"I think those statements are severely misleading and
not reflective of what is currently the case. You can
throw around percentages any way you want. If you look
at what the trust has been contributing to the school
construction budget, it's more like 30 or 40 percent."

Regardless, Simonetta and Smith agree that the future of
State Trust Land will rest on its ability to generate
funds -- and won't be given away for free.

"It comes down to this: We are in intense discussion
with the conservation community," Smith said. "Our
conversations are all around the question of
compensation. We are not going to support any initiative
that contemplates setting aside State Trust Land without
compensation. You can take that non-support as far as
you like. If they attempt to go to Congress, we are
going with them."

Eric and Kevin,

Attached is a preliminary timeline for working through all of the 
environmental related issues to deliver the necessary Resource Reports (F-1) 
for the FERC application.  There will be more details to be fleshed-out in 
the timeline, but essentially this is what we believe is strategically needed 
to deliver a complete exhibit.  If we can get the land managing agencies to 
agree to work early and collaboratively with the FERC Staff on this project, 
we may be able to get the FERC Staff to commit early resources to the project 
and cut a month or two off the tail end.  A lot of this success will be 
accomplished if we can get clearance to get on the land and perform the 
ground truthing survey work.  John

Kevin, I apologize for not getting back to you sooner as I have been out of 
touch for the last week.  I read John's message to you and agree with him 
that we should develop a formal plan to address how we will generate public 
support and address any future environmental concerns before they jump up and 
bite us.  As you may know, Flagstaff is one of those areas where there is 
much environmental support to keep the area as pristine as possible and there 
does exist a number of environmental groups which use this as their agenda to 
keep development to a minimum.  I will forward to you a memo from David 
Roensch, team advisor in the Flagstaff area, of an article he found providing 
the active participation of the environmental groups in the Flagstaff area.  
Ive done some cusory inquiries as to land status and have polled the Bureau 
of Land Management, State of Arizona,  State Historic Preservation Office and 
the Forest Service which is the major landowner between Flagstaff and 
Phoenix.  I have not heard back from all of agencies as yet, but will let you 
know if there are any glaring environmental concerns or if there  appears to 
be trouble on the horizon.   John and I have briefly traded thoughts on this 
project and we would  like to take a more proactive approach  "up front" with 
regard to public participation and input prior to breaking ground.  Its hard 
to deal with public issues when construction is underway. 

As for the $$$$$ for the environmental studies, you are correct in assuming 
that the existing portion of the project from Bloomfield to Flagstaff will 
require very little capital, as long as we limit and ensure our construction 
activities to the existing right of way.  Proceeding south from Flagstaff to 
Phoenix is where the initial expenditures will be the greatest.  Once the 
pipeline corridor is identified and staked, surveys will need to be completed 
for the following:   threatened and endangered plants and animals, archeology 
surveys for bones, artifacts, relics etc, noise surveys should this portion 
of the project require installation of horsepower.  The FERC will require an 
EIS (environmental impact statement) and environmental report to be 
conducted.  These activities include not only the environemntal issues but 
also things like socioeconomics, land use soils, geology etc.  Past 
consttruction projects has shown that third party involvement with this 
greatly expidites the process (John has eluded to this previously).  Due to 
the rough terrain and topography of the land south of Station 2 into Phoenix 
makes this project extremely hard to give an approximate dollar amount  for 
the environmental baseline surveys and permits to be completed as the entire 
proposed right of way (140 miles) from station 2 into Phoenix will need to be 
walked and surveyed by several people.  I would rather wait until we can 
identify on a map the corridor route and send out proposals for each of the 
surveys to be performed on the pipeline prior to giving a $$$$ figure.   
However, because you need something for a preliminary budget estimate, I 
would recommend an amount of $70,000 to 90,000  for the baseline 
environmental work and this might be a little light, in the event the surveys 
identify something.......please dont hold me too close to this number as it 
is a WAG contingent upon a number of variables that are relatively unclear at 
this time.  Having the pipeline corridor identified on a map will greatly 
assist in the environmental budgeting for this project.

Subject: Project Sun Devil EIS

I received the vmail from Bill last week basically stating there were no 
environmental deal killers for this new gas pipeline project, at least not 
from a 30,000 foot high level survey.  

My question is now what are our next steps?  I am building a work order 
authorization for some minimal dollars to get things like the ROW, EIS, etc. 
scoped out.  Assuming we have necessary market support, what would it cost to 
move to the next level on the EIS?  What do we get for our money?  I am 
mostly concerned about the "greenfield" portion of the line that would run 
from Flagstaff to Phoenix.  

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss an action plan.

Eric,
As we discussed, with ENSR's assistance I have developed a projected timeline 
for developing the FERC required F-1 Exhibit (12 part Resource Reports to 
satisfy the NEPA requirement) in sufficient detail to meet the FERC filing 
requirements and expedite the processing of the environmental portion of the 
application.  The aggressive timeline assumes that the expedited FERC 
"Collaborative Approach" will be implemented throughout the processing of the 
application.  Even with the "Collaborative Approach" and all of the upfront 
work done with the environmental community to streamline the processing, the 
schedule is very, very optimistic and assumes that all conflicting issues 
will be resolved quickly and the processing continue.  

I have requested that Jon Schmidt (ENSR) begin working on a detailed cost 
estimate, by quarters in two phases.  The first part of the estimate would be 
to project the environmental cost, by quarters of preparing the 12 Resource 
Reports (including the necessary field work) that would get Sun Devil to an 
FERC filing in the first quarter of 2002 that would not be rejected.  The 
second component of the cost estimate would be to complete the field work and 
permitting phases during the processing of the application.  This includes 
participating in FERC scoping meetings and agency meetings as required.  This 
would include assisting the third party environmental contractor in working 
on the EIS to expedite the writing as needed.  It would also include 
mitigation packages to satisfy agency requirements.  The third and final 
component would be to budget for a Third Party Environmental Contractor to 
write the EIS document during the time that the field work is being developed 
and to process the same with the FERC Staff.  Once we get the "White Paper" 
Fatal Flaw analysis that ENSR is preparing for this project we will have 
enough information along with the budget to get us to the FERC filing to make 
some quantifiable decisions on moving forward when comparing those to the 
commercial advantages that you are developing.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  John Shafer

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

Gentlemen,

Attached is our work to date (minus the telephone call summary sheets and
permit requirement summary sheets [Appendix A] you've already received) on
the Fatal Flaw Analysis/Briefing Report for Project Sundevil (or is it The
Sundevil Project, or Sun Devil [2 words, rather than 1])?  It truly is a
working document, and can be expanded in areas as you see fit, or there may
be other areas you may want us to discontinue researching.  This review
draft is provided for your review and input as to where you might like it
expanded and where you might like effort to be discontinued.  As I mentioned
yesterday, I will be out of town the remainder of the week.  Please contact
Jon Alstad in my absence with any action items and input you may have.
Thanks,  Scott
