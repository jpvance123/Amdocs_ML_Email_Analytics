1) Only online transactions will be commission-free.
2) The message bar at the top of the screen shows the ultimate customer, but 
not the broker. Today's Transactions at the bottom of your Stack Manager 
screen shows both.

Geoff, here is a revision of the sheet I had sent you before regarding the 
floor bid for IT tolls, this is the proposal that TCPL is trying to push 
through the committee!  They have changed the % in the marginal fuel calc 
from 15.5 to 14% which has reduced the floor pricing to approx. 102% firm 
through the winter 2001!

Attached is the agreement in principle reached today between TCPL and its 
Stakeholders on terms TCPL is prepared to bring to the board if there is 
broad enough industry support.

The following are the key changes from the draft distributed on Monday Feb 12.
Discretionary revenue sharing  to TCPL subject to cap of $5M (from $7.5M)  
with higher sharing percentages by revenue class.
AOS of 4% (from 2.5%) of FT demand charge paid as credit to IT invoice.  4% 
is approx 240 mmcfd.
IT floor to be railed between 80% and 120% of FT toll but floating monthly 
with marginal fuel cost.

There are two very controversial elements that may cause some parties to 
litigate.  TCPL has slipped in the severance costs for 200 employees that 
were laid off in Dec 2000 but technically terminated in 2001.  At $100K per 
employee this works out to $20 m or about one cent on the Eastern Zone toll.  
TCPL is also not willing to consider liquidating this year any of their 8 bcf 
of storage working gas and are not even conceding that the gas belongs to the 
shippers.  Speculation is they have arbed much of it  this winter and are 
trying to pocket all of the upside with no benefit to the shippers who paid 
for it.

If TCPL proceeds with this agreement without opposition then there will be a 
cost of capital hearing to set the ROE and capital structure.  If they don't 
then there will be a lengthy rate hearing where many time consuming issues 
such as higher depreciation will be debated.  If TCPL proceeds with this deal 
in the face of litigants (from the LDCs perhaps) it is unclear which issues 
will be raised  or how long the hearing will take.

TCPL is requesting by close of business Tuesday that we indicate whether we 
will either
a. sign the agreement or
b. neither sign nor litigate or
c. litigate to NEB.

I understand from discussion earlier this week with Jon McKay and Rob 
Milnthorp that Enron will choose Option B.  We can review on Tuesday.  If 
anybody wants clarification on anything let me know.

Kevin

Subject: S&P Statement of Principles


Enclosed for your review is a Statement of Principles regarding TransCanada's 
Service and Pricing
Settlement for 2001 and 2002, resulting from discussions that took place in 
Toronto on February 15 and
16.  We request that Parties indicate by end of business on Tuesday, February 
20 whether they:

    1)  Will be a Party to this Settlement;  or

    2)  Will not be a Party to this Settlement but will either support or not 
oppose the terms of the
Settlement when submitted to the National Energy Board for approval;  or

    3)  Will oppose the Settlement and will litigate the terms of the 
Settlement when filed for
approval with the National Energy Board.

On Wednesday, February 21 we will provide you with the details of the level 
of support and will
indicate to you whether TransCanada is prepared to process this Settlement 
[i.e. detailed MOU and NEB
Application] on the basis of the support received.

If TransCanada determines that it will process the Settlement, TransCanada 
will wish to issue a press
release (indicating that a Settlement with a number of Parties has been 
reached) because a Settlement
of this nature may be "material" to TransCanada shareholders.

We thank all Stakeholders for their valuable input into the development of 
this Settlement.

TCPL has told me that the absolute earliest implementation date for the new 
services (i.e. AOS, new IT Floor, FT Makeup) would  be July 1 and may be 
later than that depending on the level of opposition.

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

How does Friday sound for our chicago compressor \ interconnection meeting?  
Can you guys arrange a meeting room and lining-up one of ENA's compression 
experts?  Tim will be ready to discuss his project and expected costs.  Let 
us know what other information we should be prepared to discuss.

Following is the model which calculates the new IT tolls for TCPL under the 
proposed marginal fuel cost calculation.  Geoff, you may want to look at this 
new sheet, I had my tolls right but my percentages wrong for the points.

There is one more addition to the Meeting Notes from last week.  I overlooked 
the very important live feed for Gas Daily/intra-month curves, so the revised 
file below adds this as Issue #2a.

Also, regarding our next meeting:  Normally I'd like to hold our weekly 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however, I will not be here this Wednesday 
and Thursday.   So, please mark your calendars for a meeting on Tuesday, 
March 13 at 11:30 am in EB3270 to review progress, discuss the Gas Daily 
issues and address any questions on direction, priorities, etc.   Please let 
me know if you cannot attend.

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

TCPL intends to seek an interim 2001 Eastern Zone toll of CDN$1.1462/GJ 
starting January 1/01.   This is a 13.6% increase.  They are saying to avoid 
protracted litigation over interim tolls they are only seeking an increase to 
reflect non-renewals and current costs, ROE, capital structure and 
depreciation .  This is not what they intend to seek as a final toll which 
will likely be significantly higher. 

In order to ensure TCPL's position is clear, Garry Mihaichuk, TCPL Exec VP 
for Operations will be attending tomorrow afternoon's briefing on their  
upcoming toll application and pitch their argument to continue negotiations.

Details of their proposed interim tolls are attached.

Kevin

Geof,

Please review the meeting notes for the requirements of GTV II phase 2 in the 
attached file. Please let me know any discrepancy and changes you want me to 
make.

The volatility skew data is stored in one of ERMS' database table. The skew 
data is currently maintained by John Griffith. We have a user interface built 
in Excel for down-loading and up-loading skew data. I think John has not 
started using the interface yet.

The testing for the volatility skew implementation has been done by john by 
calling IT for running the portcalc against production database. We will put 
the changes out in the test environment so that Chuck can also check it out. 
I will let Chuck know once it is available for him, hopefully, sometime today.

Thanks

Zhiyong

Colleen,

I didn't see the live-update of Gas Daily curves in your meeting notes. 
Should we add it? Please advise.

Thanks

Subject: REVISED MEETING NOTES

Please see the attached revision to the meeting notes.  You will see the 
change indicated in RED under Issue #2, Gas Daily.  We want to put this item 
on HOLD for now because there are more implications to this change that we 
need to resolve before coding begins.  The focus for now should be on putting 
physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve 
questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, 
design of the new screens, etc.  

Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and 
Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously 
with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, 
CPR, ERMS & TAGG.  I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know 
the time and place of next week's meeting.  Normally I want to hold the 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to 
Tuesday.  I will let you know first thing Monday morning.  Let me know if you 
have any questions or concerns.

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Our crack marketing team (cary & tony) are at the norther border shipper 
meeting.  I will get them to start looking for more harper or Northern  
Border - manhatten gas when they return.  Attached is a spreadsheet showing 
tony's deals done to date.  I believe that we left harper at Vent +.06 and 
NB-manhatten at chicago + .04.

Thanks for getting me the signed (so far) copy.  (Beth and Philippe, please 
sign the document today ).  When they have signed please recirculate the 
final signed copy to everyone.

On a going forward basis, please ensure that we receive weekly progress 
reports including any variances to timeline deliverables (hopefully these 
will all be early deliveries!).  

Secondly, please could you deliver the Inception Document for GTVII Phase II 
by Friday April 6th.  I believe Geof is ready to sit down with you on this.

All looks great so far.

Any problems - just give me a ring.

Thanks

Geoff and Chuck,

I have submitted an e-request for each of you to have access to the TDS 
Parallel environment.
Once this is complete, one of us will help you create a shortcut on your PC 
desktop to run it.
You should not need any additional access; you will use your existing TDS 
production id and password.

Thanks, d.n.

1. TCPL has sent out a press release announcing the S&P Settlement attached=
=20
below.=20

2.  I have also attached the final version of the agreement from which a mo=
re=20
detailed MOU is to be worked out over the next few weeks. =20



3.  We will want to pay particular attention to the IT floor and the detail=
s=20
of how the marginal fuel test is set between 80%-120%.

4. Taking advantage of the AOS credit will mean shippers will have to=20
nominate and schedule IT services.  This would require extra operational=20
resources to be dedicated to the accounts we control (Enron Canada,=20
Petro-Canada, Sunoco, Papier-Masson and Aberfoyle).

5. Below is a projection of the illustrative toll for 2001 and 2002, based
on this agreement.

Illustrative Toll

For illustrative purposes, the Eastern Zone Toll is $1.115 / GJ in 2001
and $1.173 / GJ in 2002. The tolls are based on 9.61% return on equity,
30% equity
thickness, $15 Million Miscellaneous Discretionary Revenue and known
allocation units as at April 2000. The increase to the Eastern Zone Toll
in 2002 over 2001
is mainly due to increased depreciation rate (approximately 1.5?) and no
regulatory amortizations (approximately 4.0? as this was a $79mm credit
in 2001)..

Under this allocation unit scenario, sensitivities for changes to ROE
and equity thickness on the Eastern Zone Toll are as follows:


      100 basis point change in ROE changes the Eastern Zone Toll by
approximately 2.7?/GJ.
     5% change in equity thickness changes the Eastern Zone Toll by
approximately 3.4?/GJ

6. This is how the stakeholders have lined up in supporting the document::

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the 
analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the 
IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any 
divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - 
I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit 
down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

I had called but you were out.

Zhiyong had ask me to look into the GTV Live feed projects (see below).
I have seen the Curve manager spreadsheet.  I would like you to point me
in the right direction by:
 - telling me who are the traders who are requesting this changes.
 - can I get a copy of spreadsheets that they want the live feed on?
 - how many spreadsheets are we changing?
 - etc...

Issue 4:  Live feeds for Gas Daily/intra-month curves

? Develop live feed capability for intra-month curves just like we have for 
basis, etc.
Once this capability is complete, traders will have to set new curves.  We 
expect the curves to be set as follows:  The Henry Hub intra-month curve will 
be tied to the NYMEX feed.  Most (if not all) other curves will be tied to 
the Henry Hub intra-month curve in some way.  Traders will have to set 
differentials.

Developing the live feed capability for intra-month curves is feasible, and 
the development timeline from the IT group is 3 weeks (see project 
timeline).

Please see the attached revision to the meeting notes.  You will see the 
change indicated in RED under Issue #2, Gas Daily.  We want to put this item 
on HOLD for now because there are more implications to this change that we 
need to resolve before coding begins.  The focus for now should be on putting 
physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve 
questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, 
design of the new screens, etc.  

Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and 
Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously 
with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, 
CPR, ERMS & TAGG.  I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know 
the time and place of next week's meeting.  Normally I want to hold the 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to 
Tuesday.  I will let you know first thing Monday morning.  Let me know if you 
have any questions or concerns.

TCPL and the Stakeholders have been meeting regularly since January and are 
close to a partial two year toll settlement along the following lines 
acceptable to TCPL:

Cost of Capital and ROE - to be litigated in NEB Rate Hearing
Operations, Maintenance and Administration Costs - 2001 = $223M    2002 = 
$216.5M
Depreciation - 2001 2.76% (increase of 0.1%)   2002 = 2.91%  (approx $60M 
over two years)
Authorized Overrun Service of 2.5% of FT credited to IT services
Employee Severance costs amortized over 3 years
Revenue Sharing to be capped at $5M
New Services to be tariffed and run through expedited Tolls Task Force 
Process.  If opposed at TTF, sponsors can file application with NEB.
IT Floor = greater of 80% of FT toll or sum of incremental marginal fuel cost 
pus FT Commodity toll plus 5% of daily FT demand toll
STFT - status quo
AECO/ANR Storage - TCPL commitment to review monetization and disposition 
options on 8 bcf this year

In terms of an Eastern Zone toll and prior to taking into account any 
increase for higher cost of capital, this represents about CDN$1.10/GJ in 
2001 and $1.15 in 2002 (assuming discretionary revenue of $40M/year).

Going around the table most stakeholders, including the LDCs and CAPP gave it 
unenthusiastic support although IGUA and Centra Man indicated they have 
strong problems with AOS if it is run as a credit to IT services.  El Paso 
and PGE were non-commital and may end up opposed.  Representing Enron, I 
expressed concern about the lack of clarity around what marginal fuel costs 
mean but indicated we would unlikely to be opposed (i.e prepared to litigate) 
if it was otherwise widely supported.

TCPL is to draft agreement language for distribution next week.

Any questions let me know.

Tony indicated to me that PGL would prefer to have his summer Harper 
purchases done as ENA.  The gas supply contract was set up to allow PGL to 
continue to purchase their own supply (for vendor diversity reasons I 
believe), but there is no reason ENA can't purchase this gas themselves 
(assuming that Tony's counterparties don't object to the change).  Tony will 
try to complete these transactions as ENA (or enovate, if necessary).

Geoff/Hunter,
If this agreement works for all parties, I want to ensure this plan is 
communicated to the East/Mid-West regions to provide communication across the 
Enron created regional boundaries.

Please advise.

Thanx,
Laura

		 Subject: Eastern Canada LDC gas coverage

Laura,
Geoff and I talked over the coverage on the eastern Canada LDC's (Union and 
Consumers in particular).

Presently the following occurs:
i) Calgary origination covers eastern industrials and some structured LDC 
business (eg. asset mgmt or unbundling issues);
ii) Calgary trading covers one month Empress sales to the LDC's;
iii) Geoff and his middle marketers cover Union and Consumers for mid market 
storage or transport plays in Ontario (or the US for Union and Consumers 
assets in the US), plus US gas supply into Panhandle or ANR transport held by 
the LDC's.  Geoff of course also does the Dawn, Parkway etc. trades.  Calgary 
origination also does some mid market deals with Union.

 
Canada origination is in the process of hiring a director and manager for the 
Toronto office to cover gas eastern LDC's and industrials.  Offers went out 
to these individuals last week.

Here's what we would see as the going forward arrangement:
i) The new Toronto based originators, with support from Calgary origination, 
will handle all structured products with the eastern LDC 's.   This would 
include longer term transport and storage arrangements and unbundling 
services, risk management products, and term commodity sales or purchases, 
physical and financial.   Basic middle market deals within Canada would be 
done by the Toronto originators working with Geoff, just as any middle 
marketer dealing with the trader.  There would be on-going coordination with 
Geoff et al in Houston to make this work;
ii) Calgary trading will continue to cover one month Empress sales;
iii) All gas supply for the LDC's bought to be put onto their US pipes, will 
be done out of Houston by Geoff et al.  Toronto would be advised of any 
transactions just to be kept up to date on the LDC's actions;
iv) Shorter term (seasonal or less) storage or pipe positions taken by Geoff 
to manage trading positions in Ontario or the border points, or to create 
opportunities, will continue to be done by Geoff et al.  For any longer term 
positions, Toronto origination and Geoff will work together to ensure value 
is maximized.

Laura, please give me a call (403-974-6741) with any questions on this.
Geoff, if anything doesn't look right, let me know.

Subject: Service and Pricing Settlement Principles


Attached is the Statement of Principles under TransCanada=01,s Service and
Pricing Settlement for 2001 and 2002.    The document outlines
principles of the settlement that were established as of Friday February

discussion.  Document 1 provides information on the Merger Costs and
Benefits Agreement and the provision to amortize severance costs over 3
years.  Document 2 provides a calculation of TransCanada=01,s incentive
revenue based on the proposed sharing percentages.  These percentages
were raised in the proposed mechanism to compensate for the introduction
of AOS service.  Document 3 reviews the calculation of marginal fuel,
used to calculate the IT price floor.

A phone conference meeting will be held in room 2902 of the TransCanada
East Tower commencing at 8:30 AM M.S.T.  Long distance participants
should call 1-888-832-0082. Local participants should call 216-0900. The

Attached is the initial data request to be sent to MGU this week.  This list 
is intended to cover the basic information we need for modelling purposes and 
to get our arms around a preliminary valuation.  The more detailed and 
"proprietary" questions will come later when we feel more comfortable with 
the confidentiality of this process.

If anyone has any additions let me know ASAP.  (This list might help with the 
SEMCO RFP as well)

Louise,

Thank you for your suggestion. I agree that it is critical for us to get 
feedbacks from Geof as early as possible. For instance, Geof suggested some 
changes to the design last Friday. The suggestion requires some re-work on 
the user interface and some changes in the daily risk management process.

I love to have the team meet Geof daily. I will check with Geof for his 
availability.

Thanks

Zhiyong

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the 
analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the 
IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any 
divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - 
I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit 
down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise

I think its a good list to start off with them.  I modified it to include a 
few minor additions (see below). Thanks for the inquiry.

Regards,
Ed

PS  Also, please include Louis DiCarlo on the distribution for all of this 
type information in the future.  Thanks.

As we discussed yesterday, the TCPL Mainline Service and Pricing Settlement 
language
on the proposed Capacity Turnback Policy may be very important feature of the 
Settlement
if ENA ends up reducing its sale to the plant and is responsible for 
mitigating the cost of Sithe's
transportation upstream of Chippawa.  The other features such as FT Make-Up 
Credits and AOS
Credits on Sithe's transport will create new opportunities to generate 
incremental revenues for
ENA and Sithe.  The IT Floor Price  will directly impact the "death spiral" 
of future capacity 
decontracting and resulting increased demand charges for Sithe if the IT 
Floor is placed below
100% of firm tolls.  

Here are some additional comments and questions on the draft language on 
TCPL's 
Turnback Policy:

1) Policy is good only through December 31, 2002, the ending date of the 
Settlement.
 There are a couple pipeline expansions (i.e. Iroquois' Eastchester and a 
rumored
 alternative to the Canadian portion of Millenium) that have a Fall 2003 
in-service
 date.  Will TCPL's "queue" for new capacity kick-off the Turnback Policy?  
Is there
 a requirement that TCPL's upstream capacity match up with takeaway capacity 
in
 the U.S., for example Iroquois's 230,000 dth/d Eastchester project.  Sithe's 
capacity
 may only partially prevent an additional expansion from Dawn to Waddington.
 Sithe's capacity, however, would have higher value if the rumored Dawn to 
Niagara
 expansion alternative to Millenium becomes a reality.  Can the language be 
clarified
 so that we don't lose out on turning back Sithe's capacity if an expansion 
project
 does not quite hit the deadline of December 31, 2002?

2) Requests for Turnback to be only posted on TCPL's bulletin board.  Can 
TCPL be
 required to make a written notification to all FT shippers?  What will be 
the minimum
 amount of time that shipper will have to prepare turnback bids?  Several 
weeks to 
 a month is typical for U.S. pipelines and can occur simultaneously during 
the Open
 Season for the expansions.

3) Existing FT shippers along the path on the Mainline System being expanded 
may
 offer to turnback all, or a portion of, their FT contracts.  What criteria 
and who 
 determines the path to be expanded?  If a downstream expansion project is for
 10 years, what if TCPL only needs to expand for the first couple of years 
and then
 there is more turnback?  It just seems that there is so much TCPL discretion 
on the
 bid and evaluation process?  Could some guidelines or goals established ahead
 of time, in addition to the highest NPV process, that would direct how some 
of these
 decisions are made?

4) FT Shippers can turnback capacity on a permanent or temporary basis.  Is 
this 
 the approach that TCPL is proposing to handle that capacity is only needed 
for  
 say 10 years to match up with Iroquois' Eastchester project?  In the U.S. 
shippers
 have ROFR rights to extend their contract after the initial term.  Is 
turnback capacity
 and the evaluation process that TCPL is proposing considering extending 
contracts
 beyond the primary term?

5) Turnback premiums and turnback discounts.  I believe the goal should be 
that
 Shipper's such as Sithe, who have the longest contract term on TCPL's shipper
 list, are protected from any increased rate base that will lead to higher 
prices in
 the future if the entire pipeline is not fully contracted.  This is an 
optimization step
 that needs to be included during the bid evaluations.  I am not clear whether
 the proposed NPV approach and the Policy Item #7 fully protects long-term 
 shippers?

6) During the NPV evaluation, are 100% tolls used or just the reservation 
charges?

7) The valuation of the NPV cost of new Facilities and/or "Transportation by 
Others"
 capacity to meet new service reuirements.  Sithe's St. Clair to Chippawa 
transport
 is already a "TBO" capacity contract from Dawn to Chippawa.  Could the 
wording
 be changed in the evaluation formula so that TCPL considers the net cost 
impact
 to the TCPL. on the net facility impact, rather than just any new savings in 
"TBO" 
 capacity costs?  

8) All turnback costs and revenues will be recorded in a Flow-Through Deferral
 Account.   Will remaining firm shippers see all the benefit or the cost from 
how
 this account will be applied in the next subsequent Test Year?

Ruth
