I must apologize regarding the lateness of this e-mail. I sent the Excel file 
with crude oil data as an e-mail attachment earlier this afternoon, and when 
I checked my mail just now, I discovered that it had been rejected because of 
its size.

I have reduced the amount of data somewhat by using the following 
limitations: WTI Crude Oil swap transactions only, starting from January 1, 
2001, with delivery in the USA. This allowed me to get rid of some 
unnecessary fields. Please note that there are no calendar spread options or 
basis options included in the data, and, as this is from Clayton's database, 
it does not include failed trades or limit-order trades.

The Excel file ("Crude Data") can be found in:

O:\_Dropbox\Tom Barkley

I have started looking at the data already, but it does not seem possible to 
plot all 24000+ points in one Excel chart. I hope this helps.

Tom

 There is a VERY good reason why he cannot pass "official" interviews.  I 
will be more than happy to interview him, but if he doesn't know anything, 
then it shows that he hasn't put in the effort to learn, and is cheating his 
way through school.  

 If memory serves me correct, this was the guy who talked all the time, and 
flattered anyone who he thought would be valuable to him.  There are many 
other reasons why he doesn't want to appear on interview lists.   I would be 
reluctant to treat him any differently than his classmates.

Vlady, here are my comments:

1. NG Correlations : 
- leave existing methodology while using more recent data (1 month instead of 
3 months). This should go anong with running the calibration code more 
frequently 
(at least once a week);
- put the version with weighting for correlation into production. 
2. Implement term structure of correlations for selected groups of 
commodities through joint factor loadings estimation for each of these groups 
I experimented with a group of Brent and 61NY, Christian is working with WTI, 
Brent, C3GC. The experiments should identify suitable groups. 
IT needs to provide a column in some rms table to identify the groups and 
slightly modify vatrfacs code. This will address power correlations as well.
3. FFvols: Smoothing methodology for implied vol curves corresponding to each 
of 12 months
 - develop solutions for improving the existing methodology (Research)
 - implement the proposed solutions (Research, IT)
 - test the results (Research, RAC)
4. Jump Diffusion - NG: finding the evidence of jumps, not obvious.
5 & 6. - I agree.
7 IR & FX Var in RiskTrack - should be probably #1 in this list. 
 - the VAR code is ready, 
 - some results for IR VAR are validated already. (IT, Research, Risk 
Control) 
 - some minor modifications to calibration code vatrfacs are required 
(related to FX data) (IT);
 - data completeness and consistency is still a problem, specifically: 
Futures rates (Infinity, IT);
 - FX books are not set up properly (Risk Control, IT)

Tanya.

Subject: VaR questions

Consistent with our research lunch discussion yesterday, I would like to 
formalize and prioritize VaR related developments. Please review the projects 
and priorities and make comments/changes. If we are in agreement, I would 
like to set a time table for addressing these issues.

The following VaR development/improvement projects were identified (in order 
of priority):

1. NG Correlations 
 Action steps:  - finalize and describe the alternative methodologies 
(Research, RAC)
   - evaluate the methodologies and select a superior one (Research, RAC, 
Traders)
   - implement the selected methodology (Research, IT)
   - test the results (Research, RAC)

2. Power Correlations (this methodology should be expanded to other 
commodities)
 Action steps: - implement an expanded correlation matrix for power 
(12-months) (Research, IT)
   - test the correlation matrix (Research, RAC)

3. FF Vols
 Action steps: - develop solutions for improving the existing methodology 
(Research)
   - implement the proposed solutions (Research, IT)
   - test the results (Research, RAC)

4. Jump Diffusion - NG
 Action steps: - implement the jump diffusion process for Gas (Research, IT)
   - test the results (Research, RAC)

5. Price Caps
 Action steps: - accumulate and summarize price cap information (RAC, Traders)
   - implement the price caps (Research, IT)
   - test the results (Research, RAC)

6. Intra-month Vols
 Action steps: - develop a methodology for smoothing the intra-month to 
monthly vol transition for power (Research)
   - implement the new methodology (Research, IT)
   - test the results (Research, RAC)

Durasoft (the company that did the Java class) will be holding a course on 
COM object programming for Enron Networks.  COM allows for programs to be 
written such that they are available for execution to other programs on a 
language independent basis.  Several Research members are interested in this 
technology.

The class is $15,000 for 15 people and NetWorks has a few spaces that are 
unfilled.  We can send a few people, therefore, for about $1000 each.  The 
course is May 14-18 (which conflicts with the EPRM 2001 Conference), so they 
need a total soon.

Is this course something group members can sign up for?

Thanks,
Martin

Today's focus: The security double standard
---------------------------------------------
By Jeb Bolding

Security is a top concern for everyone in the application
service provider space. With so many options on the market, it
can be difficult for customers and ASPs to pick the right kinds
of security for storage and transmission of sensitive corporate
information.

Perhaps the ideal security product for ASPs is one that gives
customers the most comfort, is reasonably cost-effective, and
can be managed by a staff that may not be expert in security.

The toughest part for ASPs is that their customers hold them to
a security double standard. These customers often expect better
security for their remotely hosted systems and data than they
provide for their local systems.

I find this ironic, considering most security infractions occur
from inside an organization, not outside. Conventional wisdom
places the percentage of breaches at 80% internal, and 20%
external (though I haven't independently verified these
statistics).

Based on that information, I would think customers considering
an ASP model for applications and data would be stumbling over
one another to locate their systems at an ASP, thus reducing
their exposure to system compromises.

Instead, prospective customers typically hit the ASP with
security questions that may not be outside the expertise of the
ASP in question and may be only marginally understood by the
customers themselves. ASP business development staff have to
become versed in the technology workings of VPNs for data
transfer and public-key infrastructure for authentication and
encryption, for example, just so they can get in the door with
a potential customer.

Unfortunately, comprehensive security procedures and
technologies are typically very expensive to implement and
require a level of security expertise that most ASPs cannot
hope to implement and maintain. And I'm not so sure these
technology answers are really solving the problem of security
for ASPs and their customers. Again, 80% of security breaches
come from the inside. In a lot of cases, that means that the
true threat is from people who are already inside the security
demilitarized zones. It seems to me that security technology is
really only part of the answer to the overall security
question.

In my opinion, ASPs and large enterprises should look beyond
the latest security technology and hire security experts from
the Department of Defense, NSA or the CIA who can help
implement security policies and procedures that will be
effective in eliminating the 80% internal breaches.

There are several documented systems, publicly available from
the government, that outline the policies and procedures
necessary to meet certain levels of security. For example,
there is a series of trusted systems books available from
INFOSEC, each named after a color: the Teal Book, the Orange
Book, and the Bright Blue Book, all of which are great
resources for a variety of security topics.

No doubt, there are some commercial enterprises that also
adhere to recognized security standards and can provide the
procedures and technology necessary to ensure the integrity of
critical business information inside and outside corporate
networks. Partnerships between ASPs and these emerging
companies would make a lot of sense.

I don't mean to exclude technology solutions from this
discussion. I believe that there are significant strides being
made to make security technology more usable and affordable.
But I fear that ASPs are setting up service-level agreements
with their customers that guarantee certain levels of security
and intrusion detection, but are really only covering the most
visible problem.

  As a professional concerned with power and weather's effects
on power demand, you must be interested in the two online services
provided on http://www.climaton.com/

    1. Weather & Electricity Demand Forecast Online
       http://www.climaton.com/
      (When prompted, please use

       Weather-based daily electricity demand forecast for each
of the next 7 days is issued every morning, for the entire U.S.,
9 geographical regions, 48 individual states, and over the service
area of most U.S. power companies. This information can assist power
producers in scheduling their power plant operation, help users to
plan for potential interruption. Power traders can use this info
to predict short-term power price movement. So, visit
http://www.climaton.com/ now and see how power demand is responding
to the cold front currently attacking most part of the country.

    2. Weather Derivatives Online - Data & Pricing Tools
       http://www.climaton.com/

       You can view and obtain historical HDD and CDD data and

Dear Vince
?
Further to my telephone conversation earlier today,  I am writing concerning 
the GARP 2001 Virtual Convention. There  are a number of delegates that are 
keen to download your presentation but I have  put them off until now since I 
have been awaiting your 'extended presentation'.  As yet I have not received 
this and I was wondering if I could use your existing  presentation, at least 
until such time as you could send me the extended  one?
?
I have attached a copy of your extended  presentation and unless I hear from 
you by tomorrow I will make this available  to delegates.
?
I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  continued interest in GARP 
and look forward to hearing form you in the near  future.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas

Allan,

I shall be glad to meet you. I am planning to attend the Energy Symposium
and we can meet on the location. If business keeps me at the office,

Vince,

I hope things are well with you and your family.

The reason for contacting you today is to let you know I will be in Houston 
next
week between Monday and Wednesday inclusive.  If there is an opportunity to 
meet
up, probably informally, it would be useful to discuss our continuing 
activities
in the areas of Strategy, Value and, increasingly, Real Options.

If you are attending our Energy Symposium, or can meet up, please contact me 
at
your convenience.  If we do meet, I would also like to introduce you to one of
our senior managers from Houston:  George E. Danner.  George is a member of 
our
US National Strategy team and part of our global network of specialists 
working
on real option pricing.

If I do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy Thanksgiving.

ALLAN

In my summer update about the acquisition of MG Plc and the integration of=
=20
the metals business into Enron, I reported that we were aiming to complete=
=20
the integration by the end of the year. I am pleased to report that we are=
=20
well on the way to meeting this target. =20

September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it bo=
th=20
the co-location of the London and Tokyo-based metals staff with Enron=01,s=
=20
offices and the first quarter of combined reporting under Enron Europe. =20
Ensuring a smooth transition for both the metals staff and the metals syste=
ms=20
into our London headquarters took a tremendous amount of co-ordination by=
=20
teams across the company on the part of the former MG team and the=20
integration team at Enron Europe.  Nevertheless, =01&D-Day=018 arrived with=
 minimal=20
problems and the metals team open for business as usual on the morning of=
=20
September 18th. =20

Another key initiative that commenced during September was the re-positioni=
ng=20
of the MG worldwide metals business as Enron Metals. With the exception of=
=20
the Henry Bath & Son Limited warehousing division, which will remain as=20
currently named, the re-branding initiative was kicked off in the UK and=20
followed by Japan and the US.  The re-branding initiative is on going with=
=20
all other remaining regions set to undergo completion of the name change by=
=20
the end of November.

Enron Metals is represented throughout the world.  I have attached a region=
al=20
office summary that depicts Enron Metals=01, locations (Appendix I).

In light of the progress that has been made since the summer, I thought it=
=20
would be helpful to provide you with a brief recap of Enron Metals=01, core=
=20
business areas and identify those members of the metals team who will be=20
leading commercial efforts moving forward.=20

Merchanting Division

The Merchanting Division, led by Michael Farmer (+44 (0)20 7783 2049), is a=
=20
worldwide copper merchant, one of the top three independent merchants of=20
copper concentrates and nickel and the leading European merchant of recycle=
d=20
non-ferrous metals.  Core activities of the merchanting division are:=20

? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals =01) Enron Metals trades as a principal=
 with=20
producers and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and=20
concentrates (particularly copper, aluminum and nickel), exchanging qualiti=
es=20
and locations and lending and borrowing metals.
? Global Stockholding =01) Through its affiliate, Henry Bath & Son Limited,=
=20
Enron Metals holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehouses around the=20
world.
? Merchanting of Recycled Metal =01) Enron Metals trades as a principal wit=
h=20
suppliers and consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.  Enron has=20
augmented its European recycling platform through the acquisition of assets=
=20
of W&O Bergmann, the leading German Recycling Business. =20

Financial Services Division

The Financial Services Division, led by Michael Hutchinson (+44 (0)20 7783=
=20
2079), provides market-making and trading services to Enron Metal=01,s phys=
ical=20
metals trading business through futures trading as a member of the London=
=20
Metal Exchange and as a member of COMEX in New York.  The Financial Service=
s=20
Division will continue to be comprised of brokerage activities for LME and=
=20
COMEX contracts and be a market-maker for both futures and options contract=
s=20
on the LME and COMEX and in OTC metals contracts.=20

With much of the metals business moving to online trading, significant effo=
rt=20
has been put into getting metals contracts incorporated into EnronOnline=01=
,s=20
portfolio of product offerings since the metals business=01, integration in=
to=20
Enron this summer.  Today on EnronOnline we are trading six metals (Copper,=
=20
Aluminium, Nickel, Zinc, Lead and Tin) with over 150 products available.

Enron Metals now has almost 800 financial counterparties on the books, with=
=20
300 of these having EnronOnline accounts.  Trading volumes have increased=
=20
from a couple of trades per day in September to a high of 300 in October. T=
he=20
attached charts depict the established metals results compared to the start=
=20
up of US natgas (Appendix II).

Origination

Enron Metals established a London-based commercial unit under the direction=
=20
of Eric Gadd, Vice President-Global Metals Origination which is focused on=
=20
completing highly structured and long-dated transactions.  It will integrat=
e=20
with existing merchanting and financial service competencies to lever up=20
earnings creation.  Currently, the origination team is working on a number =
of=20
Q4 transactions in Australia and the Americas.  The deal pipeline for Q2 ha=
s=20
prospects in not only these regions but also Europe/Africa and the Middle/F=
ar=20
East.   Close and regular communication between the metal origination team=
=20
and other business units inside Enron is essential if we are to succeed in=
=20
building a new capability to achieve earnings targets and deliver sharehold=
er=20
value through Enron Metals.  Your active involvement and close co-operation=
=20
here is appreciated.

Warehousing (Henry Bath & Son Limited) =20

The Warehousing operations, led by Ed Dablin, operate under the name of Hen=
ry=20
Bath & Son Limited.  Henry Bath has been in business for more than 200 year=
s=20
and maintains a global operation for the physical handling and storage of=
=20
non-ferrous metals, including zinc, tin, copper, nickel, lead and aluminum.=
 =20
Henry Bath provides support to both the Merchanting and Financial Services=
=20
Divisions, and also engages in independent warehousing operations.  Its cor=
e=20
activities include worldwide storage of metals and other products such as=
=20
cocoa, general goods and worldwide shipping services.=20

Presently, Henry Bath maintains over three million square feet of storage=
=20
worldwide (most of which is leased), with the largest facilities located in=
=20
the United Kingdom (Liverpool, London, Bristol, Immingham), the Netherlands=
=20
(Rotterdam), Spain (Bilbao, Barcelona), Singapore, and the United States (N=
ew=20
Haven, New Orleans and Los Angeles).

Rob Soeldner is managing the integration efforts for me.   Please feel free=

business.

Hi Vince

Following our conversation earlier today; here is a list of projects and 
services (together with main contacts) requested  from UK Gas, UK and

I am currently providing a limited daily morning weather briefing to UK Gas,

Vince,
How are you? I apologize for not contacting you earlier. We bought a small
house and it is consuming all of our time. We also adopted a little puppy
which proved to be a lots of work. Believe it or not, I have not had the
chance to visit NY city yet (I was there once briefly to drive to the
airport).
I just received the check for the airline ticket. Thank you for taking care
of this issue quickly. Shirley was, once again, superb. Take care. Hope you
have great holidays. If you happen to be in the NY area, please let me
know. Perhaps we can have lunch or a drink together.

Vince,
 I'm working for Chris Clark, and I was wondering if you can help me to get 
in touch with someone in the research group who had written some of our 
software.  Kevin Golden tells me that he thinks Jason Sokolov was the guy who 
had written an application for us to download emissions data from the EPA web 
site.  Could you confirm this?  If this is correct, is he still in your 
group?  Thanks a great deal.

Today's Focus: Aggregation of storage
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Anne Skamarock

There are several ways vendors are allowing for aggregation of
storage, and even though they all use the word aggregation, the
word means different things to different companies.

The prospect of aggregating storage devices is intriguing, but
it raises several questions.  How much storage can I aggregate,
or logically collect, for ease of management, yet make it
available to my business applications with a performance
appropriate to the environment?  By the way, once I have all
this storage, how do I manage it easily?  And does all of the
storage have to be of the same type/class, or even from the
same vendor?

Also, in a perfect world, I would be able to define the quality
of service needed for my business application and data handling
and it would all just happen.  But we don't live in a perfect
world - yet.

One company selling the ability to aggregate storage is
XIOtech.  XIOtech's Magnitude storage subsystem allows
customers to aggregate disks on a volume basis.  What this
means is the server system attached to the Magnitude subsystem
will see the disk volume that is presented to it.  Using
virtualization, the disk volume that is presented to the world
looks like a normal disk volume when in fact it could be made
up of pieces of many different disks within the Magnitude
chassis or on many different Magnitude subsystems linked
together.  The software that allows for the virtual
presentation of volumes is located within the Magnitude
subsystem.

XIOtech has partnered with Veritas to gain high performance and
functionality on the server side, in growing these aggregations
of disk with no downtime to a business application.
Installation of the Magnitude subsystem requires an
administrator to answer two or three questions, and takes just
10 minutes.  XIOtech has a leg up on the competition in its
technology, but because this is a fairly new company with only
one base product, one size must fit all.  In reality, customers
need to be able to choose the appropriate price/performance
characteristics of their storage and match it with their
business applications.  And wouldn't it be nice to have only
one storage-management environment for the whole enterprise,
from very small to very large storage?

Last week, Tivoli announced a new initiative code-named Storage
Tank (where did they get that name?).  This initiative goes a
long way in addressing end-to-end storage management, if Tivoli
can pull it off.  While the Storage Tank initiative spans all
areas of storage-area network (SAN) management, aggregation is
a large part of this initiative as well. Within a SAN appliance
that would interoperate with agents located on server systems,
Tivoli plans to implement capabilities similar to what XIOtech
has today.  Again, using virtualization, the SAN appliance
would present storage groups (logical volumes) to the servers.

The one advantage this architecture has over storage subsystem-
based implementations is it is both server- and storage-vendor
"agnostic."  Theoretically, you can have many different storage
subsystems behind the virtualization layer to present to your
business applications, running on many heterogeneous servers as
you please.  You could, in effect, manage an entire
enterprise's storage from one place, obtaining storage that was
appropriate for the business need, when you need it.  This is
an admirable goal.

I think the road will be rocky for Tivoli for several reasons.
The interoperability testing for verifying that different
storage subsystems play well together is a huge task.  Ease of
installation, configuration and reconfiguration will be issues
as well.  Will current Tivoli agents need to be upgraded?  How
much will that cost?  Will I have to pay consultants every time
I want to trade out a subsystem for something new?  Even though
Storage Tank holds great promise, it is impossible to know if
it will live up to that promise because it is not available
today.

You will continue to hear the terms "aggregation" and
"virtualization" when talking with storage and storage
management vendors.  These concepts not only promise to make
managing the plethora of storage that is, or soon will be, part
of your enterprise much easier. But they also start to move
into the realm of business data and information management, the
true goal of businesses.

Amitava,

Thank you for the detailed info on the required data and thoughts on its 
scope.  I'll discuss it with Mike and Eric this morning.  Also agree that 
we'll almost assuredly save money in the long run by building a more robust 
model off more comprehensive data to start with.

Cheers,
Scott

Subject: Short Term Private Firm Model: Static historical 
snapshot+performance data for model development

Mike, Scott, Eric,

After brainstorming and discussing further on data here, we think that our 
final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows:
We need bankrupt, default and nondefault (which covers nonbankrupt) accounts 
with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following 
the latest snapshot.  Monthly performance indicator need to be available for 
the entire 12 months performance period.  We will need all the bankrupt and 
default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights.
For the purpose of model validation, we will need data with above specs 
covering 16 months of performance.  This means that we will need rolling (4 
quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data for 4 monthly shifts:

Input snapshots           Performance
1999 March end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end, 1999 December end   12 
month end performance for Jan 2000 through Dec 2000
1999 Feb end, 1999 May end, 1999 August end, 1999 November end    12 month 
end performance for Dec 1999 through Nov 2000
1999 Jan end, 1999 Apr end, 1999 July end, 1999 October end     12 month end 
performance for Nov 1999 through Oct 2000
1998 December end, 1999 Mar end, 1999 June end, 1999 September end    12 
month end performance for Oct 1999 through Sep 2000

We will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator, if available during the 
performance period.  Our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90+ 
days delinquency on any trade credit.
We have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big 
picture, it makes sense to spend  the extra amount to get the right data for 
analysis.
Please let me know your thoughts.  This will require D&B to give us a 
modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly.

Regards,
Amitava

To:? Participants (and those who could not attend)
?????? the April 20 Wharton ET Conference

Thanks for participating in the recent Strategic Partnerships
conference at Wharton, and contributing to making it such a great success.

We are enclosing with this email a presentation that we unfortunately
had to cancel due to time constraints and we wanted to make sure you
saw this because it involves some very interesting statistics
involving EMAIL and informal organizational structure.

Ruhul Quddus, an MBA student here at Wharton, with advice from several
faculty and researchers (including us) has developed a procedure
that allows firms to map their informal organization structure using
email logs from the email server (note: the content of the emails is NOT
required; just the data on who emails whom).

Ruhul's initial results are very interesting and thought provoking in that 
they
show that consideration of informal organization structure can potentially
enhance the value of decision making in situations such as integrating
acquisitions and coordinating alliances.? We hope you will look through the
attached slides which outline some of his findings.

Ruhul's contact information can be found on the slides.

Hi Vince,
Just a note to confirm our meeting on Wednesday at 3:30pm.
Best setup would include a portable projector for my notebook.
I don't know how many people other than yourself you want to have at the 
meeting.
If it's only yourself, we could use a monitor on a conference table in place 
of the projector, if that's better for you.
Looking forward to seeing you.
Bob Brooks

Vince,

I thought you might be interested in this too...
We have had several meetings with UH up until now and things are progressing 
nicely.
Rice U will follow in mid January and after that, Uof Co at Boulder and 
Chicago will follow too.

Per Mark Tawney's request, I am going to include you in another message 
following this.  Don Kouri from UH will be visiting soon.  The purpose of 
that discussion will be his area of research - more details in the next 
message on that - and a seminar we'd like to set up and include your folks 
too...

		 Subject: Compendium of Research issues

Folks,

in view of our upcoming collaboration with educational & research 
institutions, I am putting together a compendium of problem statements within 
various research domains.  This list will be used to solicit the interest of 
researchers and graduate students who would then work under our supervision.  

While the details of how this effort will be organized are still largely up 
in the air (list of financial institutions, reporting structure, financial 
considerations, confidentiality agreements, exchange of seminars and short 
courses, etc) we are making an attempt to define our common interests.  Such 
areas are:
Econophysical (e.g. market development; how weather expectations shape the 
market; etc.)
Product development (e.g. agriculture and weather; solar radiation and 
telecommunications, the Jet stream and Airlines; etc.)
Analytical/Mathematical/Simulation efforts (building a MC simulation for any 
given problem might fall under here; working with incomplete data sheets/ways 
for filling in data holes; etc.)
Purely weather (e.g. a statistical analysis of the long term effects of solar 
phenomena on weather would enter this category)

In light of the above and within the next couple of days,I would like to ask 
you to provide me with problem statements within these areas that you have an 
interest in and which might offer themselves to this kind of collaboration.  
At this point, we're brainstorming; we would thus be happy to have even the 
sketchiest of ideas and have the weakest of expectations for well formulated 
projects.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Yannis T.

Title: Atlantic Basin Markets Precariously Balanced for Winter
Author: Refined Products Team
E-Mail Category: Watch
Product Line: Refined Products ,

URL: http://www.cera.com/client/rp/wch/121200_19/rp_wch_121200_19_ab.html
*********************************************************

A psychology of shortage--driven by short-term
fundamentals and amplified by political events affecting
the crude oil market--has dominated refined products
markets for much of 2000. But does this signal a
fundamental shift in the business environment for the
refining industry? Probably not, since the margin
strength of this year has been the result of the
declining inventories and steeply backwardated futures
prices that have been a feature of crude oil and refined
products markets through most of 1999 and 2000. Global
refining capacity continues to outpace demand with
notable additions to effective capacity in Asia, the
Middle East, and Africa in store for 2001. As a result,
CERA's outlook is for moderating refining margins as the
year progresses.

Subject: Risk Profile and Liability Mitigation Product

Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects 
which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of 
Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and 
maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to 
its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services 
offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of 
deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.  

Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would 
feature similar assets and services.
SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers 
that comprise each segment. 
The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific 
projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list 
represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried 
from PCCS.
The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related 
assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities 
have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, 
Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly.
Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption 
of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all 
assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real 
estate segment.





Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and 
Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation 
product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  
Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.

Thanks.

Richard

Folks:

I am trying to set up a meeting with professor Don Kouri of the University of 
Houston and I believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion.  
If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for 
yourselves, please let me know.

This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area 
of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and 
attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).

We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the 
seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester 
season for schools).

A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be 
talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about 
the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earth's atmosphere.

		 Subject: HDAF seminar topics


Hi Yannis,
I got your email without any problem. For possible topics to
be discussed at a small ``roundtable'' format meeting, here are
some possibilities.
1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling'', data
extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital
data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential
operators to digital data, etc.)

2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which
existing methods encounter stability problems.

There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a
single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting
we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust
for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which
you are interested, I am willing to focus on them.

Regarding timing of a meeting, I am free from teaching duties now
so I am flexible. I will be in Houston all of December. I look
forward to hearing more from you. With best wishes,
Don Kouri

In cooperation with the Economist Intelligence Unit and Knowledge@Wharton,
we are pleased to invite you and your colleagues to a one-day workshop on
"The Conscious Corporation: Organizing for Knowledge in the Global Economy."
The date is December 8th, 2000 and the location is the Aresty Executive
Education Building at the Wharton School in Philadelphia.

We feel this subject is of pivotal importance in today's fast-moving
economy.  The experiences over the past decade in knowledge management
indicate that directives to share knowledge are rarely adequate.  Knowledge
development requires active and ongoing mechanisms of organizing to sustain
the exchange.

The workshop will consist of presentations of Wharton faculty research plus
the experiences of industry.  We are attaching an agenda.

We do hope you can join us.  Contact Rachel Barrett at
rlbarret@wharton.upenn.edu if you are interested in attending.

Very truly yours,

Sid Winter & Bruce Kogut
Co-Directors, Reginald H. Jones Center
The Wharton School
University of Pennsylvania

Hi all,
I have made modifications on the model as requested.  It now handles different
volatility curves as well as 4 different hour blocks.

Vince and Stinson,

Bob finished a comparison between our spread option model and
SciFinance spread option model.

SciFinance model is very accurate. In their model there is a knob to
control the accuracy, more accuracy needs more computation time.
Also for high correlation, the model runs significantly slow.

I forward Bob's mail below, if you get a chance, please take a look.

Hi  John and Vince   I had an opportunity to review the slide  presentation 
of  EP   and  here is my
assessment.  Bottom  line:   Too  robust by 2005  on merchant plants  being 
built; up and running  baseload  and
too optimistic  about offshore   gas volume   growth by 2005  as well.

WESTERN MARKETS
EP forecast  is  way too high  by  2005 by their assuming 1.4 BCFD of new 
power generation gas  demand
could be in place in the  west  in such a short  time..This means ..they may 
be  forgetting to consider  the tough
 NIMBY   siting  hurdles  that stalled  all  but  550 MW  of the  current   
10,000 mw of planned  capacity  in the  West.....EP is  assuming not  only  
do  80 percent of  these planned plants  get  built  but then they l run  
baseload...which is
very unlikely. Most  shall be   peaking  or intermediate load in the start 
years  which trims that gas use by 50 to 85 percent.
WEFA  and   ENE Corp. thinks  the  area gas use growth will be   more like  
3.2/  2.9 BCFD  BY 2010 --  but 80 percent of  this  gas  use  happening  
late -- not early -- in the time period out  to   2010.  I foresee  the EP 
scenario as unrealistic given NIMBY and enviro siting limitations short term 
in the West. 

WEST  SO CENTRAL  TX/LA  

EP  sees the  area  at   2.7 bcfd  by 2005;   way too high  compared  to  
WEFA  and  ENE   at   -400 mmcfd  and  +500 mmcfd, respectively BY 2010   
and  even  prematurely  high by PIRA's  robust   standard  of   3.5 bcfd  by 
2010 .
EP  like PIRA assumes   the  gas thermal demand  stays on even  as merchant  
plants  get  built;  ENE and
WEFA  assume  merchant  kwhs and lower variable costs and better heat  rates  
shut in the thermals or  cause them to be  repowered  as combined cycles.  
Given where EP's  pipes  are located in the  West  and Texas  and up the 
Northeast  this  demand scenario  fits  their wants...so I can see why they 
like  this scenario  but   it assumes power generators  will not  act  
economically rationally.

NORTHEAST
EP sees  2.7 bcfd  by 2005  vs WEFA, PIRA and  ENE   seeing   2.3/2.5/2..6  
bcfd  by 2010 .Way premature  for this area to  see such growth  as  385 
mmcfd  annually.  They  are real robust on  offshore  gas  being there  to  
fill this need too.

GAS  SUPPLY
Offshore  supply, which  has  fallen   2.4    bcfd   since    1995   is 
expected  to  grow in EP's  forecast  by  3.6  bcfd  by 2005...extremely   
unlikely  given the slow  start  Shell  and  Texaco and Exxon offshore   has  
been  showing  us so far.  I was  burned  in  my  supply analysis  work in  
1999  by Shell's  forecasts of their   adding  alone   2  bcfd  to  offshore  
deliverability  by  2000  which never  happened --  it fell  500mmcfd  
instead !!  so  I do not   give  a lot of  hope right now   for 3.6 bcfd 
incremental  gas  by 2005  per  EP.  Cambridge  Energy  says  if all goes  
well  the Offshore  overall  will be up  1.1- 1.7  bcfd  by  2005..way less  
than  EP  is showing.

Please read the following message from Kathie Grabstald and Michelle Vitrella 
in Public Relations.  The Weekly Electronic Newsletter is a project that Mark 
Frevert requested and it is important that Enron Global Markets be 
responsive  when we are asked for information from our business units.  
Please pass along to Kathie and Michelle the name of a contact person in your 
group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly 
newsletter.  Kathie has assured me that the person providing the information 
is not required to do the actual writing, but provide bullet points which she 
will then prepare in paragraph form.  Michelle will send a reminder message 
to the contact person when the updates are needed.

Thank you for your assistance with this project.

America, Industrial Markets and Global Markets with the click of a button.  
Our goal is to provide information about recent developments and events from 
the various business units straight from the source, YOU!  We need your 
cooperation and participation since ENA/EGM/EIM readers want to know more 
about Global Markets.  Please help open the door for us by getting your 
direct reports on board and encouraging them to send us news.

Watch for a weekly reminder email giving upcoming newsletter deadlines.  If 
anyone needs assistance formatting business highlights, we will help turn 
their bullet points into paragraphs.

Hi Vince

I tried dialling you around 3pm UK time, and again at 3:30, but with no 
luck.  I met with John, Michael Brown, Tani, Joe Gold and Richard Lewis.

The meeting was productive, and all were positive about expanding the 
Research team provided:
1. The people are working directly on commercial problems.
2. An outflow is eventually set up to match the inflow, so that Research acts 
as a training ground for commercial-quality quantitative PhDs.

Since they acknowledge that some lag will be necessary before we can bear any 
kind of outflow, this gives us an effective increase in headcount.  Michael 
Brown has agreed to a target (ambitious, but worth trying) of hiring two 
commercial quality PhDs per quarter, on the agreement that in time we have an 
outflow equal to this.

Given the current attempts to curtail hiring of "support" staff, I feel this 
is as good a result as could be expected, and I'm certainly happy with it.

I've no doubt Tani will update you further when she sees you.

Steve

Hello Vince,

We've now got some slick results on rigorous and replicable avg temp
forecasting models for twelve major U.S. cities, with implications for
weather derivative demand and supply (although they are not yet written
up formally).  Will you be in Phila anytime soon?  I would like to sit
down with you for a couple of hours to show you the results and
discuss.  Are you still interested in pursuing a joint project?  I am
excited about this.

All the best,

Frank

John,

I put together a presentation of the simulation model for WTI market maker 
for you. 
The P/L results are investigated by assuming different scenarios.

The key variable is the number of trade per day, therefore is varied  from 
200 to 1000 trades.

Scenarios are generated by different spreads, net open position allowed, and 
time period.

Take a look what I have prepared, and let me know things you want to add or 
delete.
If you have any questions, I will be happy to discuss with you.



Zimin

PS: this presentation is only for the open-close trading.  I will produce 
exact the same
sequence for the continuous trading (close-close) once you approve the 
content.

Beth,
 
I  enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible Enron/Argonne  
National Laboratory collaboration. As I mentioned, one of our  divisions, 
Decision Information Sciences has built state of the art tools  for modeling 
and simulating energy use. They have trained many country  energy ministries 
on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy  technology issues.
 
I've  attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in 
this area.  Decision Information Sciences also has done much work in studying 
critical  infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also 
may be of  interest. Finally, they have been pioneers in the development of 
agent  based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that  
are impossible to view with over approaches.
 
I will also include a copy of my  correspondences with one of your e-business 
groups under separate  transmission.

Dear Jason and Dr. Kaminski,

Attached are files for our project. The word section is in .pdf format and
excel models are zipped to reduce size. You need to unzip the file first to
view the models. When reading the excel file, press "F9" to initiate
calculations.

Our team members are also interested in meeting with Dr. Kaninski to talk
about the models and visit Enron's trading facility.

We appreciate the excellent class Dr. Kaminski has brought to us.

Felix Feng Lu
on behalf of our team

Meet the head of the leading firm in our business.

Imagine the opportunity!

Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run 
the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North 
America.

So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a 
co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or 
three.

To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a 
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower's wares.  You do an IPO and take in 
about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period 
it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your 
energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get 
up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine 
having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene 
Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before 
that president of BankAmerica's Global Retail Bank with its consumer, 
commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+ 
branches.

Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.

Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail 
(to read the full story see attachment):

?   How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is 
the heart of NewPower's business plan?
?   How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
?   How he's going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million 
by the end of 2001.
?   What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What 
figure is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
?   Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest 
the second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest 
unregulated retail  marketer in the US.
?   How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
?   What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
?   What does he see as his biggest challenge?
?   Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
?   Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
?   What's the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
?   Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a 
bill, what kind of margin can it make now?
?   How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We're actually in a very good 
position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our 
favor ... "
?   "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a 
bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone 
else in the industry by several orders of magnitude."

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" 
parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.




Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating 
his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see 
the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new 
input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

Tnaya,
I did a preliminary numerical experiment to verify that the correlation does 
get distorted if the nonnormality is strong. If you want I could document the 
distortion for various degrees of non-normality and for different levels of 
target correlation between the non-nomal variables.  I could also work on a 
correlation mapping scheme if deemed critical for our purpose.
Thanks,

Everybody, 
we were talking for a while about using non-normal distributions in the 
Monte-Carlo simulations in our VAR model.
I put together some suggestion regarding this. The text is under 
O:\_Dropbox\Tanya\non_normal_logs.doc

Look through this 3 page document, and let me know what you think, please.

Stinson,

I will present "Market Risk Management in Petroleum Industry" for 
2000 International Chinese Petroleum & Petrochemical Technology 
Conference, Houston, Dec. 1-4, 2000.

There will be 200 plus delegates from US, China and Taiwan to participate
the conference.  It is a free advertizing opportunity for Enron.

If you have time, could you take a look at the presentation to see if any 
errors.


Thanks,

Zimin

Vince,
I enjoyed your presentation at the SIAM workshop last Friday. I have
a much greater appreciation for the difficult problems you all solve.
If at all possible, I would like to get a copy of your talk and
any references to review papers in the general area of market modeling
and potentially control. Have a great weekend.

Best Regards,

Dean Kassmann

Please see below for my note to Jeremy at the bottom and his reponse.   I 
have placed Mark Ruane's yields against a mid November default frequency

more important:

A               0.04           0.47          1.48

In looking at the One-Year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how 
many more defaults occur in a recession (1991) versus average (1981-1999)  
historical default rates (%):


                             Investment grade                Non-Investment 
grade
Avg. 1981-99            0.07                                             4.21
1991                            
0.12                                           10.40
Multiple                      1.7x                                            
2.5x


Looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals 
default rates to obtain a "multiple" (how much more severe than historical):


                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         infinite      44.2x       21.7x
AA            67.0x        19.4x       18.5x
A               24.5x         19.1x      14.2x
BBB           5.6x           5.5x        6.2x
BB             3.6x           2.1x         2.6x 
B                 1.1x           1.2x        1.7x


On the 10 year historical figures,  we need to be careful as the S&P static 
pool figures show a definite seasoning (lower defaults in late years probably 
due to prepayment) versus our contracts.  Secondly, the S&P figures have 
Withdrawn ratings, which usually mean they are stale, but loosing some 
information content.   

I will ask Emy to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Thanks. I would STRONGLY  suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful 
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right 
architecture for looking at credit in our deals. It is broken, not clear, 
killing our velocity and true capabilities. We also need to look at staffing, 
skills sets, the credit reserve model etc. Perhaps you should take a crack at 
an agenda.

I visited with Vince Kaminski for about 20 minutes today regarding the market 
implied defaults rates  and the disconnect in investment grade land.  He is 
seeing the same anomaly and agreed that we as a company need to revisit the 
methodology employed in calculating the implied figures.     I will follow 
through and report back.

Tracy,
Break it down into 8000 files of 1 kB, and send each one in a separate

Just kidding!
Try to send the whole thing.
If one of the servers refuses to accept it, then break it down into several

I know for sure that I can take files as large as 2MB.

Vince and Stinson,

I have some thoughts on the re-org for the group. 

As far as the valuation as concerned,  I think we should not divide ourselves 
by
commodity.  Simulating power prices is not too much different from simulating 
gas 
prices, and so is the options pricing.  Actually there is some synergy to 
share
some common techniques that are specific to each market. 

 So I propose that Stinson runs a "bigger" valuation group that  includes the
power-related deals pricing.   In terms of personnel, Alex, Tom, and Lance
could be a valuable addition to the valuation term.

Let me know if my thoughts are too far off.


Zimin

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Dr. Arnold suggested that I get in touch with you for possible employment 
after I finish the MBA program. He was not certain as to the exact 
position(s) for which I would be considered and recommended discussing it 
with you further. I have an undergraduate degree in Finance in which I was 
exposed to a formal derivatives class, and I am currently in Dr. Arnold's 
real options class. Additionally, I have had some working experience with 
this class of securities. Please find attached a copy of my resume (Word 
format). 

If you have any questions, I can be reached via email or at 225-266-6200. I 
am looking forward to speaking with you.

Thank you,
George T. Moss

Hi Ted

A number of points regarding the migration of London office to RisktRAC have 
arisen over the last couple of months.  Who is the formal project manager for 
London's migration?  Whenever London RAC or Research have a bright idea (see 
below), I want to be sure it either gets actioned, or is turned down - a 
point person is just what we need.

All the best,
Steve

Hi Steve - forgot to get back to you about this - Oliver by the way is in 
Lanzaroti (can't spell) on a boys week away.
As far as I know the project manager is David Port, although he is based in 
Houston. I guess Ted Murphy is the one 
who will eventually become the head as I think he is expected to be 
permenantly based in the UK after Xmas.

Subject: Re: UK Power/Gas VaR from RisktRAC  

I completely agree. VaR should be calculated on a hierarchy basis from 
business level to trader level.

Two pints to consider though:

Some of the desks in Europe trade as teams and do not have individual 
ownership of positions E.g. UK power cash and term books between 6 traders.

The current Risk Trac hierarchy is designed to provide only three levels and 
we probably need four to achieve this.

I think this is worth discussing with IT in Houston to see what is possible 
and to devise a hierarchy that will work for RAC and the traders.

Hi Oliver,
After todays meeting, how easy would it be to split the VaR in RisktRAC into 
sub VaR catergories that 
reflect the individual trader risk or product type risk?
I  think that this would be a good idea in the near future as it would help 
to focus the attention of the traders on a VaR number that they are more 
likely to understand. As I understand it a position term structure can also 
be reported via 
RisktRAC which would mean that they could check their own poistion feeds 
going into the system.
I am hoping to try and adopt the same methodology for the metals business as 
I think it will help to speed up the 
roll out of RisktRAC in the UK office.
What are you thoughts on this? Do you think it can be supported by RAC in 
London?
Cheers
Kirstee

Vince,
I am writing in regards to an energy derivatives training course I am
developing.  I would like to invite you to be an instructor for the course.
A preliminary agenda is attached.  Brett Humphreys from Risk Capital
Management is teaching on Day One, and I was wondering if you would be
interested in covering all or part of Day Two.  The topics outlined here can
be modified based on your feedback.

Our training courses are structured for an interactive, classroom-type
setting.  We limit the audience to 25 people and bring in 2-3 instructors to
cover the material over the course of two days.

I will follow up but please let me know what you think.
 <<Agenda.doc>>
Thank you,
Clare Fitzgerald
Director, Training Courses

Dear Friends and Colleagues,

As strange or ironic as it may look, after three days of employment at TXU
Energy Trading, and after receiving a Red Carpet Reception by the management
of the company and the employees alike, I had to leave and come back home
due to personal reasons.  We are trying to restructure my relationship with
TXU ET, currently.
So, my contact info remains the old one - martin@electrapartners.com with a
phone number (404) 402-8957.

Regards,
Martin

Vince,


this pertains to Chris Hall, about whom Joe H left you a message earlier.

I would not mind talking to you about him and vouching for his 
qualifications.  The guy is excellent.  He worked for me  (I was the hiring 
manager) until I left IT a few weeks ago.
Please give me a call if you would like some input.  His resume follows...

Stinson,

Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
a Coal Plant valuation.

This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
only volatility curve is availiable).

Let me know if you have any questions.

Zimin

While reviewing our trading limit documentation, I realized we never obtained 
signatures on the limit application for Credit Trading that was approved in 
the December BOD meeting, and I'd like to complete our policy files.  Would 
you please print the attached document and obtain Bryan, Ted, News/Jordan and 
then Sherriff''s signatures, and fax it back to me at 713 646 2194 for our 
files?  I'll get Vince to sign for Research, and then send to Rick Buy and 
Jeff Skilling to sign along with our other trading limit policy documentation 
from the BOD meeting this past week.

This document is exactly what Bryan sent to Oliver in January, and I just 
customized it a bit to delete unnecessary signatures, identify the commodity 
group, etc..  

Regards,
Cassandra.

Rudi and Steve,
factor loading analysis was performed at the end of September for 17 
following UK curves:

PPPWD1-PPPWD6, PPPWE1-PPPWE6,  PE, PEO, NBP, SYSTEMDAY and SYSTEMNIGHT.

This analysis was based on historical forward prices information from 
RisktRac.
I sent the results to Vlady and Naveen for review on 10/4/00.

The results look decent for 3 curves only: NBP, SYSTEMDAY and SYSTEMNIGHT.
"Decent" looks as follows:


"Decent" means: the factors are rather smooth, the first one makes the 
largest contribution, the second one changes sign once.

The factors for the rest curves do not look good, for example for PE:



This messy picture means that the prices for different maturity contracts for 
PE are not highly correlated and
factor loadings analysis is meaningless in this case.

My conclusions: 
1.We should use NBP, SYSTEMDAY, SYSTEMNIGHT factors and map all other UK 
curves into one of those.
2. Winston's code is ready.
3. The mappings have to be identified by Risk Control and communicated to 
Winston.

Thank you,

Tanya..

I have communicated to them that we are taking a fresh look at all our

would like to hear their product suite "vision" for a customer such as ENE.  
I emphasized our interest in predictive power of any model(s), and

Hi Iris

I heard that Enron has a comprehensive document that lays out issues
related to bandwidth trading.  Would you be able to track it down for me
easily?

Jin, 
since Winston is on vacation Monday-Wednesday this week can you, please, do 
the following:
1. Run  vatrfacs code based on recent data in stage and calculate:
 -  factor loadings for NBP, SYSTEM:DAY and SYSTEM:NIGHT ;
 - correlations across all main commodities including 17 London curves: 
PPPWD1-PPPWD6, PPPWE1-PPPWE6, PE, PE_O, 
  SYSTEM:DAY, SYSTEM:NIGHT, NBP (presently the correlations for each of UK 
curves versus other curves are 0).
2. Run VAR based on these factor loading and correlations.

Please, let me know if you have any problems.

Tanya.

Oliver and Kirstee,
we are going to start running VAR for UK from RisktRac in stage environment 
in parallel with the spreadsheet . 

As soon as Winston runs the vatrfacs code based on recent data we'll send you 
correlations and factors for UK curves
so that you can load these inputs into VAR spreadsheet and then compare the 
spreadsheet results to RisktRac results based
on the same inputs (this will, in fact, repeat the exercise you and me did 
during your visit in Houston in October).
I have to ask Winston to print out for you the forward forward volatilities 
for some date so that you can put them
into the spreadsheet as well. 

Thank you,

Tanya

Please see below for my note to Jeremy at the bottom and his reponse.   I 
have placed Mark Ruane's yields against a mid November default frequency 
table.   Note there may be a slight shearing in dates, but the concept is 
more important:


Market implied cumulative default rates (%):

                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         0.51           5.74         14.54           
AA            0.67           6.39          16.61
A               0.98           8.98          21.03
BBB         1.17           9.88          22.39
BB             3.27        18.62          37.51
B                4.65         24.21         46.27



S&P Historical default rates (%):

                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         0.00           0.13          0.67           
AA            0.01           0.33          0.90
A               0.04           0.47          1.48
BBB         0.21           1.81           3.63
BB             0.91          8.82          14.42
B                5.16         20.95         27.13


In looking at the One-Year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how 
many more defaults occur in a recession (1991) versus average (1981-1999)  
historical default rates (%):


                             Investment grade                Non-Investment 
grade
Avg. 1981-99            0.07                                             4.21
1991                            
0.12                                           10.40
Multiple                      1.7x                                            
2.5x


Looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals 
default rates to obtain a "multiple" (how much more severe than historical):


                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         infinite      44.2x       21.7x
AA            67.0x        19.4x       18.5x
A               24.5x         19.1x      14.2x
BBB           5.6x           5.5x        6.2x
BB             3.6x           2.1x         2.6x 
B                 1.1x           1.2x        1.7x


On the 10 year historical figures,  we need to be careful as the S&P static 
pool figures show a definite seasoning (lower defaults in late years probably 
due to prepayment) versus our contracts.  Secondly, the S&P figures have 
Withdrawn ratings, which usually mean they are stale, but loosing some 
information content.   

I will ask Emy to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Thanks. I would STRONGLY  suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful 
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right 
architecture for looking at credit in our deals. It is broken, not clear, 
killing our velocity and true capabilities. We also need to look at staffing, 
skills sets, the credit reserve model etc. Perhaps you should take a crack at 
an agenda.

I visited with Vince Kaminski for about 20 minutes today regarding the market 
implied defaults rates  and the disconnect in investment grade land.  He is 
seeing the same anomaly and agreed that we as a company need to revisit the 
methodology employed in calculating the implied figures.     I will follow 
through and report back.

Hi Vince

James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in 
EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo office's new system.  I'm a little 
uncomfortable with this since:
1. Sign off of models is something that I've been brought up to consider to 
be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to...
2. London Research is not the "owner" of Exotica, and we don't necessarily 
have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Research's code.  Indeed, 
can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating 
group for a piece of code thinks it's OK, or they wouldn't have written it 
that way.
3. I'm concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients 
without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from 
an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our 
VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!)

I've tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only, 
and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the 
trading floor to support the tools that Research write.

Your advice/guidance would be appreciated.

All the best,
Steve

James

I called and left a voicemail but I thought for the benefit of the CC's on 
this, my view is that RAC have never been required to sign off on valuation 
methods. The standard models used at Enron, like SPRDOPT and other routines 
in Exotica.xls are written by Research and therefore I have always assumed 
endorsed by Research. Having said that I do believe firmly that all RAC - MRM 
folks should have a deep understanding of the way products are valued and be 
able to assess and challenge a method. 

I am also happy to provide assistance in the process of designing a method 
but I wouldn't want either of us to feel that RAC are in the way of progress 
by being embedded in a project plan. 

In this instance, given the appropriate documentation, I would imagine the 
time taken to assess the EnergyDesk methodology would be very short - what do 
you have that I could look at ?

Subject: EnergyDesk

I would like to try to clear up a few things regarding the proposed 
implementation of EnergyDesk into Oslo. 

I thought that it was a requirement that all valuation engines (and any 
future changes to the valuation code) are required to be signed off by 
research and RAC before they can be used to value the firm's positions. If 
this is true then this is all I am looking to get onto the project plan the 
time estimates you need to complete your review process. If there is no 
requirement for RAC or research to sign off new or changed valuation engines 
then I will trouble you no further.

Thanks James

CERA Alert: December 13, 2000 

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "Boom Bust" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

Hello Vince and Mike

I want to keep you informed.

This year all baskets will be done in a timely manner.
On last year we were going through a major move therefore 
many people played key roles in keeping us together.
This year however , is a little different , as it is always nice
to give unfortunately we can not give to everyone.
I am sending a lists of who we have so far.


There are a few names on the list that  I feel we should do something else 
for this year .
under Shirley's list of names.

(not so expensive)

They are : Move Team                                who?
                     Mail Room                                    who?   
                     Facilities Help Desk                  who?

There are other tokens of appreciation that we can get for them.

Please note that you two are the only ones that have seen this e-mail so far
I will need your approval for all baskets, however your input on the matter 
will be 
greatly appreciated.The list is not completed I am still waiting for 
additions.


                    
                                              Thanks
                                                          Kevin Moore

Dr. Kaminski:

Thanks very much for taking the time to talk with me about my
electricity model when you visited Carnegie Mellon. (I was the PhD
student in Finance who had a two-factor model for pricing
electricity. My model incorporated strategic behaviour and varying
price elasticities across different consumers of electricity). While here,
you mentioned the possibility of further developing my model at Enron.
One avenue you suggested was through the summer internship program at
Enron. If this is still an option, I would very much like to talk with you
or one of your associates about working with or at Enron on my model.

I can be reached by phone at (412) 683-9085.

About The High Tech Acquisitions Research Project
A Research Collaboration of the Wharton School & Insead


The High Technology Acquisitions Research Project, jointly organized by The 
Wharton School and INSEAD, has been conducting research to identify the 
determinants of success in high technology acquisitions.?


Our research includes developing a portfolio of in-depth case studies, 
building a unique acquisitions database, and hosting semi-annual workshops 
for industry practitioners.? These tools allow? us to perform rigorous 
analysis to determine success factors in high technology mergers and 
acquisitions.? Firms that have participated in our research process so far 
include Cisco, Cable & Wireless, Hewlett Packard, Lucent, Symantec, and Xerox.


Timely Insights for Company Decision-Makers.? One of the most unique aspects 
of this project is the reporting of research in progress, to give industry 
decision makers access to the insights from our research as they are 
revealed.? To test and refine our findings, we host an ongoing series of 
workshops that bring together practitioners from some of the most experienced 
acquirers in the high tech arena, and academicians whose research interests 
converge on the role of acquisitions in technology-based competition.


Our next workshop on December 5 will be the third in the series.? Prior 
events were held in December 1999 at Wharton and June 2000 at INSEAD in 
Paris, France. (Reports of these events are available on the ET website: 
http://emertech.wharton.upenn.edu).


Objectives.? Our objective is to build a community of practice around the 
complex phenomenon of managing acquisitions in high-tech environments.? A 
major goal is to identify and validate new best practices and winning 
strategies in mergers and acquisitions.? Most of our focus involves issues of 
value and concern to large multinational corporations.? We are particularly 
interested in how mergers and acquisitions are pursued as part of a company's 
GROWTH STRATEGY.


Research Team.? The research team on this initiative includes:? Prof. Harbir 
Singh, Chairmsn of the Management Department and Co-Director, Mack Center for 
Technological Innovation (Wharton); Phanish Puranam, Project Director and

Subject: internships at Enron?



Mr. Kindall:

I am a PhD student at GSIA whho has been working on modeling energy
commodities.

When you and Mr. Kaminski visited Carnegie Mellon, I had the opportunity
to talk with Mr. Kaminski about a model for electricity that I am trying
to develop. During our conversation, Mr. Kaminski suggested the
possibility of developing the model at Enron. I have tried contacting Mr. 
Kaminski
subsequently, to find out whether my working at Enron, possibly as an
intern, was still an option, but have been unable to reach him. I have his
email address as: vince.j.kaminski@enron.com. Is this the correct address?

Alternately, could I talk with someone else regarding internship
opportunities at Enron.

Thank You

Jin and Winston,
I reviewed the factors resulting from joint estimation on 61NY and Brent in 
stage.

I see that now we have flexibility to specify the groups of commodities for 
joint factor loading analysis.
We also can specify the number of forward prices we would like to use in this 
analysis.
This is great, thank you.

Regarding 61NY and Brent analysis could you, please, use 18 forward months 
prices?  (currently it is 60).
Then we can run VAR in stage and see how this affects VAR number for 
"Financial Products" portfolio (Niamh's question)

We also have to have the same flexibility to produce factors jointly for 
power regions. Can we put power
curves information into the same table (rms_comm_name_history)?

Tanya

Winston & Jin,

we need to try to run joint estimation of factor loadings for BRENT ant 61NY
based on 18 forward months' prices. This is to capture correlations across
forward contracts for these 2 commodities, and to reflect VAR on Niamh's
book correctly.

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the 
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th 
February, 2001.
?
Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000. 
There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate 
bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are 
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. 
The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very 
well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course 
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.
?
Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:
?
1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th 
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a 
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New 
York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can 
appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken 
into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as 
possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your 
presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a 
laptop.
?
2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual 
requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably 
PowerPoint). 
?
3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you 
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my 
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.
?
If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, 
otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.
?
I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas

Subject: Alliance May Test the System Up to 1.5 BCF/d in Next Two Weeks

Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

"The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly," said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. "The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up." 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. "We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now." 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. "We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably," said Exner. "The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not." 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. "We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California."

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am interested in working on a part-time, telecommuting basis
(roughly the equivalent of 1 to 2 days a week) for about a year or
two. I can visit as necessary. I am attaching a brief resume.

Is this something that might be of interest to you? Should you have no
opportunities, can you suggest other groups? I look forward
to hearing from you.

Regards
Reddy

Vasant-

As we speak, I am in the process of working thru the bugs in the new software 
product, Data Beacon, commercial has purchased for OLAP.

OLAP refers to Online Analytical Processing. The term is somewhat a misnomer. 
The analyses capable by OLAP are not extensive. What OLAP is is a viewer of 
empiric data. It is to data as a browser is to published pages. 

Data Beacon is a gorgeous product, Vasant, and it will permit easy 
tabulations and reporting from even the largest databases, including EOL. I 
have continued to listen and store every EOL trade (now over 500,000 of them) 
and the resulting "cube" contains well over 1,000,000 records.  Within 
minutes, you will be able to come to any slice of the data you want, and view 
it in any format (table, graph, chart) you want, and export it to any 
software you want. You can save thiese views and come back to them with a 
click of the mouse.

The EOL listener, parser and marking-to-market run as compiled C code. They 
are completely stable- they have been running for three weeks now without 
fail since the last re-boot of the server. They automatically restart if the 
server reboots.

The second part of the EOL  project is SAS. It has been paid for by 
commercial, and I have worked very hard to facilitate the installation of it 
and the training in it. I have personally instructed over 30 people here at 
Enron in its use.

Where we are is an ongoing installation of Data Beacon, which should be 
finished today or tomorrow. It will take me one day to write the scripts to 
automatically "refresh" the cube as information arrives. Then, it will take 
me one day to make sure the dimensioning of the cube is appropriate. 

Finally, we have tested a web-based database constructor for the Research 
Department, which will prospectively build real time time series databases 
for you based on your specific designs.

I will deliver this compprehensive reporting solution to you this week.

Clayton

Dear Vince,

Thanks for your phone call this morning. I will ring Mike tonight, i.e. 
Houston tomorrow morning. 

....had a look at the temps and anomalies over CA, looks warm for this time 
of the year (Dec.), there has been an increase in the night time 
T_min, and T_max remains at an above average level. 

I will start setting up my models over CONUS this week. 


Regards,
Christian

Jason,

I have to break down the file since it exceeds the maximum file size for the
Rice Server.

I'll tell you how many parts you're supposed to receive in my last e-mail.

Thanks for coordinating for the class.

Have a nice day!

Tracy,
Break it down into 8000 files of 1 kB, and send each one in a separate
mail.

Just kidding!
Try to send the whole thing.
If one of the servers refuses to accept it, then break it down into several
pieces.
I know for sure that I can take files as large as 2MB.

SENT FOR SEAN HOLMES:

Thanks for your participation so far on the Breakthrough project.  We value 
your time, and recognize the burden our schedule is creating for many of our 
"Cat" participants.  We would like to amend the participation expectation as 
follows to help make the most of your time as a key leader within EES:

We will limit our all group "checkpoint" sessions to two hour maximum 
briefings, with Thursday's 12/14 marathon session (1 - 7 pm) being CANCELLED, 
and REPLACED with the following:

Tuesday, 12/19
2 pm - 4 pm
Two AC 12 - The Forum

Please put this session on your calendar, or in the alternative, designate 
someone who can represent your business unit in your absence.

We will also request  business unit participation as appropriate to certain 
unrepresented functions in our design sessions.  This direct participation 
should help assure that the final process design incorporates all 
perspectives and knowledge.  We will also step up our informal dialogue with 
both market initiative and risk representatives to assure good communication, 
specifics to follow.

Thanks for your patience, and especially your support to date.

Dear Generation/Power Marketing Executive:

At its brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a stripped-down consent agenda, 
without discussion, as described below.  Following this summary is an updated 
listing of filings at FERC.

In particular, FERC:

(1) Approved, 3-1, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, an extension of the existing 
temporary $1,000/MWh bid caps in the ISO-NE energy, automatic generation 
control and operating reserve markets through March 31, 2001.

(2) Rejected an aspect of ISO-NE's July 28 CMS/MSS compliance filing, namely 
its proposed Installed Capacity (ICAP) deficiency charge, and directed the 
ISO to reinstitute the previous, administratively-determined deficiency 
charge that the Commission required the ISO to revert to in its June 28 
Order; other aspects of the filing will be addressed separately, FERC 
indicated.

(3) Accepted in part, and rejected in part, American Transmission Company, 
LLC.'s (ATC) proposed OATT and rates, with Comm. Massey concurring.  Among 
other things, FERC rejected ATC's innovative rate proposal, without prejudice 
to ATC submitting a new FPA Section 205 rate filing, based on its finding 
that ATC's ROE and other rate proposals amounted to a "request for the 
innovative rates that we have indicated we would consider in an RTO 
context."  ATC sought such rates prior to joining an approved RTO, FERC 
specified, distinguishing this case from its September 28 Order authorizing 
innovative rate treatment for International Transmission Company.

(4) Accepted for filing TransEnergie's two filed compliance reports on its 
procedures for reassignment of transmission rights and the results of its 
open season, respectively.

(5) Rejected proposed amendments filed by two Southern Energy parties to 
their respective Reliability Must Run (RMR) Agreements with CA ISO, after 
finding the amendments were inconsistent with the terms of a prior RMR 
settlement.

Numerous significant items were stricken, including the Alliance RTO 
compliance filing (CAE-27), the Southern petition concerning its RTO plans 
(CAE-23), and the Illinois Power-MISO withdrawal docket (CAE-16).

Vince,

Greetings.  I am forwarding to you the following research request from
three of my Business School colleagues.

Best,
Ehud


Dear Trustee of the Center for Energy Finance:

Three professors of the McCombs business school, Dr. Sirkka Jarvenpaa, Dr.
Emerson Tiller, and Dr. Kerem Tomak are conducting a research project in
alliance with the Center for Energy Finance on B2B online energy trading
systems.  All three researchers both conduct research and teach in the area
of electronic commerce (strategy & policy, economics, and technology).

They are seeking your help at this time.  They would like to interview an
executive in your firm who is in charge of managing or participating in an
online energy trading exchange. They are looking beyond the first-order
effects of B2B exchanges-- benefits of dramatically reduced costs, greater
access to buyers and sellres, and improved market liquidity -- to second
order effects (e.g., redesign of  broader firm processes, greater
innovation,  standardization, etc.) and broader organizational and
environmental drivers and barriers (institutional and regulatory
structures, associations, and alliances). This is a research project that
aims to accumulate insight into firm capabilities and environmental
complexities involved in B2B energy exchanges. At this time, they are
focusing on one industry, energy trading. They are conducting interviews
with owners and operators of proprietary exchanges as well as owners of
member-based exchanges in energy trading.

The researchers would like you to kindly pass this request for a 45 minute
phone interview to a person in your firm whom most closely deals with your
firm's strategy for B2B exchanges. We would like to conduct the interviews
during December and January.  The appropriate executive or his/her
assistant can directly contact Dr. Sirkka Jarvenpaa for scheduling the
interview.

Thank you so much for your assistance and support.

David: 
 On #1, I would say the problem is not with the calculation part, but with 
the market information, or lack thereof (i.e., illiquidity). The gas desk is 
responsible for the supplying prices and volatilities. It is upto them to 
decide how they want to account for illiquidy: change the bid/offer spreads 
accordingly, or add hedging costs, or something else. And on the 
correlations, they do matter but not as much as volatility or price. Since 
these are correlations for the same underlying at the same location across 
time, I think we can make some reasonable assumptions and compute them.

 Regarding #2, I don't agree with the concept of a market top. What the desk 
does with the options is to hedge them. And the way to hedge them is hedge 
teh delta and exercise the options optimally at the same time.

 Finally, I don't think we can use a 2-year swap as a proxy for a 10-year 
swap. Longer term prices and volatilies are driven by the cost of production 
and economic variables and their uncertainities. Those don't necessarily 
reflect the shorter term issues.

Have a great Thanksgiving,
Krishna.

Having now the benefit of some experience with El  Paso, I conclude that 
Enron would offer more for me in the long term.? If  you have an interest in 
discussing the matter further, please give me a call. I  would appreciate 
your comments.?

Dear Mr Kaminiski

I am a Graduate Student majoring in Industrial Engr and Operations
Research at the University of California Berkeley. When you came for a
seminar talk in our department, I spoke to you regarding my interest in
working with your group as a Summer Intern followed by a full time
position. I am sending you my resume with this mail.

I have several accomplishments in my academic life, that includes 3
publications and some awards and I am receiving Full Scholarship from the
University for my Graduate Studies. It would be really nice of you if you
can give me a candid appraisal of my chances with the present background
that I have in the fields of Supply Chain Mgmt. Logostics Optimization
Decision Support Systems.

I am looking forward to hearing from you and working with your group in
Enron.

Thanking You
Yours Sincerely
Srijay

I am not sure I know what Becky is talking about.  Can you let me know
where you want the 1.2% allocation to go?

Thanks!

Research is currently billing and are going to bill CALME region in 2001, 
will you check with Vince and see where I should move the 1.2% allocating to

We will not send out the invoices to other BUs until further notice, because 
the support departments were told to decrease their budgets.  Also, for those 
who are going to bill EI, we need to go back to the support department and 
ask for a new allocation.  

 Enron Global Assets: made up of the commercial groups of India, South 
America, Central America and Asia 
 EGM:  LNG, Middle East and Puerto Rico support and commercial teams joined 
EGM
 EES:  Asset Operations group went to EES
 Corp:  all back office support groups (Accounting, Tax and Finance) 

Effective October of this year, the above split was done.  Don't forget to 
ask for new allocation percentage from your support group(s) for CALME 
region.  If you have any questions, call me.

Lance,

I could not open the attachment.
I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we 
don't want
to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a 
self-contained project 
and limit intern's access to additional information.

Subject: RE: Potential Candidate, Summer Intern

Hi Lance,

 he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about 
using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about 
Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if 
you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him 
specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then 
that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then 
interview him.

Vasant

Vasant,

Attached is a resume for a candidate that might serve temporarily through the 
summer.  Maybe this could be a stop gap measure until we can locate a full 
time person.  I would anticipate him working as a summer intern.

On behalf of the Jones Graduate School at Rice University, we would like to
thank all of the company representatives who have submitted Action Learning
Project (ALP) proposals. Currently, the ALP faculty committee is reviewing
all proposals received.

We also want to remind those who are planning to submit proposals of our
December 1st deadline. Please keep us updated on the status of your
project. We are happy to answer any questions or provide assistance.

Our goal is to have a good mix of projects from a variety of companies, and
we are also pleased to accept multiple projects from one company. Thus far,
many of our proposals are marketing and/or strategy related. To increase
the diversity of projects, we are especially looking for ideas that give
our students the opportunity to utilize finance skills. Of course, an ideal
project is one that allows a student to use multiple skills.

Again, thank you for your continued interest in Rice University and the
Jones School ALP program.

Tanya,
       Sounds great.  If the objective is to model d(lnS), and we see that 
vols are not constant, then one has to model vols stochastically.  If one 
assumes say a log-AR(1) or other models, even for a single contract, we still 
have to estimate 3 parameters.  Not a trivial task if the vols are 
correlated, such as in a portfolio.  I have some older literature by 
Papiancolou, Sircar and Harvey et al which tries to address and implement 
some of thes issues.  I will try to dig these up.
      Let me know if I can be of any help.
Regards
Naveen

Naveen,
I am trying to answer the question: what is the appropriate stochastic 
process to model the behavior
of commodities' prices in our VAR model. So what  I do care about is the 
behavior of log-returns. 
Any help is appreciated.

Tanya.

Tanya,
               We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an 
extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree 
for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.  

Regards
Naveen

Subject: Re: looking for "Fat Tails" in time-series for NGI-SOCAL  

Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

See the spreadsheet is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya

Oliver and Kirstee,
we are going to start running VAR for UK from RisktRac in stage environment 
in parallel with the spreadsheet . 

As soon as Winston runs the vatrfacs code based on recent data we'll send you 
correlations and factors for UK curves
so that you can load these inputs into VAR spreadsheet and then compare the 
spreadsheet results to RisktRac results based
on the same inputs (this will, in fact, repeat the exercise you and me did 
during your visit in Houston in October).
I have to ask Winston to print out for you the forward forward volatilities 
for some date so that you can put them
into the spreadsheet as well. 

Thank you,

Tanya

Winston,
here is a document related to smoothing methodology for FF vols calculation.
I am sending you also a spreadsheet prototype model with examples for gas and 
power.
 Fitting in the spreadsheet is done with "Solver". 
I'll figure out how to implement minimization in the code.

Thank you,
Tanya.

Subject: Re: smoothing methodology for extracting forward forward 
volatilities  

Following up on our discussions I implemented one method for creating forward 
forward curve
from implied vol curve. 
I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forward vol curve, each of 12 
curves corresponding
to certain month. Then I fitted each of 12 curves with a function:

y=a+A/power(x+b, beta)

I figured out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable 
for performing our bootstrapping
routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because:

y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x, t.

(I have to double check on this again. Also when beta>0.5 there are some 
combinations of parameters a, A, b, beta
for which above equality holds). Even with restriction on beta this class of 
functions represents quite a variety of shapes.

Below you see the example of fitting as well as the example of ff vol curve 
constructed from implied vol curve for NG.

I'll try this for power as well.

Any comments?

Today's Focus: Concord Communications' LiveHealth
---------------------------------------------------------------
By Neal Weinberg

For the Reviewmeister, there's nothing like the smell of real-
time data in the morning.

Historical data is nice, but it's real-time data that gets the
blood pumping. So, we took a close look at LiveHealth from
Concord Communications. LiveHealth collects real-time data and
reports it in an easy-to-understand, comprehensive and timely
fashion.

Like any new product, LiveHealth has its pros and cons. It
produces excellent reports and supports more than 500 kinds of
SNMP-aware devices. But it can't display a network's topology,
doesn't offer corrective actions, and wasn't all that easy to
install.

LiveHealth starts at $35,000, and is part of Concord's suite
that includes Network Health, System Health and Application
Health modules.

LiveHealth actively polls SNMP-manageable devices, determines
their status and condition, and displays the result in real
time. LiveHealth can present its reports via a browser-based
interface, a server-based console and Adobe Acrobat-based
reports. It also can send device status and condition data to
network management products such as Hewlett-Packard's OpenView.

LiveHealth is complex software. In addition to its
sophisticated network monitoring and reporting elements, it
comes with the CERN Web server for rendering management data
and reports as Web pages, an Open Ingres database engine for
storing network device data, and The Santa Cruz Operation's
XVision PC Xserver, which LiveHealth's server console uses to
display screen data.

LiveHealth's discovery process is quick and accurate. By
default, LiveHealth discovers network nodes daily at midnight.
At 5-minute intervals (or less often, if you wish), the SNMP
polling process probes the condition and status of network
devices. LiveHealth understands a plethora of Management
Information Bases, and it correctly recognized Lucent and Cisco
routers, Samsung and 3Com switches, and the other devices in
our test network.

LiveHealth can tell you if a device is performing as it's
supposed to, but it can't produce graphical maps showing
network hierarchies. It stores collected network device
information for six weeks in the Open Ingres database.

In its first few days, LiveHealth builds a baseline of normal
network behavior. Then, it can detect out-of-the-ordinary
events, such as excessively high or low traffic through a
router or switch port.

Once LiveHealth detects a problem, a network administrator can
choose to monitor the problem device in what Concord calls
"fast mode." LiveHealth polls the device in frequencies up to
twice a minute to help the administrator track the situation.

LiveHealth doesn't offer external alerting functions, such as
e-mail or paging, but relies instead on links to third-party
programs (such as HP's OpenView) to provide such notifications
or take corrective actions.

The strength of the program is reports that show device
information by time period, relationship to the organizational
structure and type of behavior or exception. We could see
devices that had experienced problems, by type of problem, as
well as those associated with a particular application.

LiveHealth runs on HP-UX, Solaris, Windows NT and 2000. The
documentation is comprehensive, but should include a better
roadmap to help users find the various software component
discussions in the manuals.

LiveHealth's installation was more difficult than we expected,
but we found that LiveHealth's focus on performance and its
extensive reporting are just what the doctor ordered.

Vince:

Tim Bollerslev is schedule for a seminar on Friday, December
8.  Unfortunately, his flight leaves IAH at 5:30 that afternoon so we
cannot have his seminar at the usual time.  We need to start it by 2:00.  I
thought your group might have an interest in seeing Tim although I don't
know yet what paper he is presenting.  So, you can pick the time:  10:00,
11:30, 12:00, 2:00 ...  We would like to accommodate your group if possible.

bbo

PS I heard you are definitely on for the Energy Risk Management course in
the spring.  That is fantastic.  We are all thrilled!  Thank you for making
this important contribution to the Jones School.  And, on that note, I will
send a letter tomorrow regarding the seminar funding.

Mike,

What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
positively or negatively about a person and this is how
the word is spread about an employee.
Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.

Vince,

Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is 
not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him 
with no trouble at all.

Hi, everybody,
I ran the smoothing procedure for R8 forward volatility curve (effective date 
Nov. 8, 00), which is:
1. For each of 12 forward volatility curves (corresponding to DEC, JAN, etc.  
find parameters a, A, B, beta, such that function 
a+A*(t+B)(-beta)?has the best fit.?2. Calculate forward forward curves from each of 12 fitted functions with ?bootstrapping routine.?3. Reconstruct the forward forward vol curve.??The figures below illustrate the results. Please let me know, if we need to ?see more results before starting to implement this smoothing in the test ?environment.???????Regarding the function class a+b*exp(-tc) there should be the following  ?restriction on the coefficients satisfied in order to?guarantee bootstrapping procedure to work:??a/b>2*exp(-1.5) ??We can try to use this type of function as well.??Tanya?????Tanya Tamarchenko?11/20/2000 08:31 AM?To: Naveen Andrews/Corp/Enron@ENRON?cc: Alex Huang/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vasant ?Shanbhogue/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT ?Subject: Re: smoothing methodology for extracting forward forward ?volatilities  ??Naveen,?your function class a + b(t+c)(-1) corresponds to my beta=1.

The exponentials we tried earlier (a+bexp(-cx), etc, fit well but ?gave negative numbers in the bootstrapping.?            I tried a + b(t+c)(-1) , a standard power law, and as the 
accompanying graph shows (for the 12 months), the fits are quite good.
            In this case, the ffvols do not become negative (I believe this 
corresponds to your 0 beta).  
  I would have preferred exp(-t) and variants (can explain owing to 
mean-reverting vols), but the power law might be a practical alternative 
(from an implementation standpoint).

Subject: Re: smoothing methodology for extracting forward forward 
volatilities  

Following up on our discussions I implemented one method for creating forward 
forward curve
from implied vol curve. 
I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forward vol curve, each of 12 
curves corresponding
to certain month. Then I fitted each of 12 curves with a function:

y=a+A/power(x+b, beta)

I figured out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable 
for performing our bootstrapping
routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because:

y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x, t.

(I have to double check on this again. Also when beta>0.5 there are some 
combinations of parameters a, A, b, beta
for which above equality holds). Even with restriction on beta this class of 
functions represents quite a variety of shapes.

Below you see the example of fitting as well as the example of ff vol curve 
constructed from implied vol curve for NG.

I'll try this for power as well.

Any comments?

Tanya,
               We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an 
extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree 
for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.  

Regards
Naveen

Subject: Re: looking for "Fat Tails" in time-series for NGI-SOCAL  

Naveen,

I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:

[ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)

and compared the results to normal distribution. 

I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 

Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
returns more frequent than normal), 
which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).

See the spreadsheet is under O:\_Dropbox\Tanya

I was at a conference on bandwidth in Amsterdam on
Thursday which I found quite interesting.What about writing
a paper for EPRM together on bandwidth where,by essence,
all options SHOULD be swing options?

Mark, this is a good point.  In Moody's June 1999 study, Debt Recoveries for 
Corporate Bankruptcies, there is a graph of Firm-Level Recovery Rates by Year 
of Bankruptcy Resolution (as opposed to default year).   Reading from the 
graph finds:





As the data above is based on resolution year, the same study finds the 
average length of time spent in bankruptcy is 1.30 years (median 1.15 years 
and standard deviation of 1.20 years).  The interesting point is the slide in 
recovery value 1996 to 1998.   One would wonder if the mix of high-yield 
issuance slanted towards the tech companies would yield lower recoveries 
(quick technological obsolescence--little tangible recovery value).  

Interesting to note is the December 1999 to December 2000 change in spreads.  
The table below divides the December 2000 spreads by the December 1999 
spreads.   One would have expected a pronounced flight to safety over this 
time-frame, but the figures are more mixed:

Please see below for my note to Jeremy at the bottom and his reponse.   I 
have placed Mark Ruane's yields against a mid November default frequency 
table.   Note there may be a slight shearing in dates, but the concept is 
more important:


Market implied cumulative default rates (%):

                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         0.51           5.74         14.54           
AA            0.67           6.39          16.61
A               0.98           8.98          21.03
BBB         1.17           9.88          22.39
BB             3.27        18.62          37.51
B                4.65         24.21         46.27



S&P Historical default rates (%):

                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         0.00           0.13          0.67           
AA            0.01           0.33          0.90
A               0.04           0.47          1.48
BBB         0.21           1.81           3.63
BB             0.91          8.82          14.42
B                5.16         20.95         27.13


In looking at the One-Year transition rates as a very rough proxy for how 
many more defaults occur in a recession (1991) versus average (1981-1999)  
historical default rates (%):


                             Investment grade                Non-Investment 
grade
Avg. 1981-99            0.07                                             4.21
1991                            
0.12                                           10.40
Multiple                      1.7x                                            
2.5x


Looking at where the market implied default rates divided by the historicals 
default rates to obtain a "multiple" (how much more severe than historical):


                 1 year     5 year     10 year
AAA         infinite      44.2x       21.7x
AA            67.0x        19.4x       18.5x
A               24.5x         19.1x      14.2x
BBB           5.6x           5.5x        6.2x
BB             3.6x           2.1x         2.6x 
B                 1.1x           1.2x        1.7x


On the 10 year historical figures,  we need to be careful as the S&P static 
pool figures show a definite seasoning (lower defaults in late years probably 
due to prepayment) versus our contracts.  Secondly, the S&P figures have 
Withdrawn ratings, which usually mean they are stale, but loosing some 
information content.   

I will ask Emy to set up a meeting to discuss further.

Thanks. I would STRONGLY  suggest an offsite sooner than later with a handful 
of the right people so that we can step back and design the right 
architecture for looking at credit in our deals. It is broken, not clear, 
killing our velocity and true capabilities. We also need to look at staffing, 
skills sets, the credit reserve model etc. Perhaps you should take a crack at 
an agenda.

I visited with Vince Kaminski for about 20 minutes today regarding the market 
implied defaults rates  and the disconnect in investment grade land.  He is 
seeing the same anomaly and agreed that we as a company need to revisit the 
methodology employed in calculating the implied figures.     I will follow 
through and report back.

Vince,

Thank you for making the visit to Pittsburgh and learning first-hand of the
MSCF program.  It was a pleasure having dinner with Kevin and yourself.

Jean Eisel has been in touch with me (and others) to follow up on your
interest in establishing "liaisons" at CMU.   We have a number of faculty in
the business school keenly interested in the energy field and in energy
derivatives particularly that it might make sense for you to meet.

Indeed, there are many avenues we could explore.   If your interest lies
more in broadband than energy, we might consider possibilities with faculty
conducting research in wireless technologies.  Alternatively, I would be
pleased to offer our distance-ed program (currently running live interactive
video broadcasts via ISDN to London, Frankfurt and Bangalore, India) as a
"testing ground for internet-based transmissions.

Let me know how you would like me to proceed.  (If any or all of the above
is "off-the-mark," my apologies.  As they say, things sometimes get lost in
translation!)

I put together some suggestion regarding this. The text is under

ELECTRONIC TRADING. Power is following natural gas to become an 
electronically-traded commodity. The products, the technology and the future 
of electricity transactions. Kevin Sluder, Vice President, HoustonStreet 
Exchange.

NUTS AND BOLTS OF RETAILING. What it takes to put an energy retailing 
operation together-- the cash and credit requirements, back office, 
information technology, staffing, marketing, sales and organizational 
considerations. Andrew Serri, Vice President, AmerenEnergy Marketing.

RETAIL: WHAT WENT WRONG, HOW TO FIX IT. Retail electric deregulation has thus 
far been an underwhelming success, but a great deal has been learned, and it 
is eminently fixable. By Dr. John O'Brien, Principal, Skipping Stone

MANAGING BILLING. The complex requirements for managing billing and

Officer, Peace Software.

execution, reduced transaction costs, increased number and frequency of 
transactions and increased specialization are just some of the changes to 
energy markets wrought by the web, and it's just beginning. Implecations of 
the internet for energy markets. E. Russell "Rusty" Braziel, Chairman and 
Director, Altra Energy Technologies.

Watch out! The Basle Committee is just wrapping up a special holiday present 
for bankers - the first-ever capital change for operational risk in banking. 
The new proposals come on top of a wave of new ideas in measuring economic 
capital for operational risk and managing down losses from people risk, 
system risk, process risk and external threats. Hear some practical answers 
to selecting methodologies for operational risk discussed by experts in our 
Operational Risk iConference.

ERisk is pleased to announce an iConference on

Practical Methodologies for Operational Risk Management

Keynote Speaker: Tony Peccia, Vice President of Operational Risk at CIBC

Followed by a panel discussion, which will include the following 
distinguished panelists:

Marcelo Cruz, Director of Operational Risk at UBS AG  
Tony Peccia, Vice President of Operational Risk at CIBC 
Karim Rajwani, Senior Manager of Operational Risk at Royal Bank of Canada

When: Thursday, December 14 at 12 noon EST/5 p.m. London time.

Topics to be covered: the battle between "quantitative" and "qualitative" 
approaches, measuring the success of operational risk management, applying 
large institution methodologies to smaller institutions, and much more.

Recommended background reading: 
The Operational Risk piece in our Risk Jigsaw
You will need to log in to be able to click through to this tutorial, which 
features insights from "expert witnesses" (including panelist Marcelo Cruz), 
the 12 steps of the operational risk management process, and links to 
additional resources.

Registration: This conference is totally free, and you can participate by 
using any computer with Internet access and a telephone.

Naveen,
your function class a + b(t+c)(-1) corresponds to my beta=3D1. If we are go=
ing ?to use certain class of functions we have to specify the range of para=
meters?a, b, c, beta, etc. that guarantees us to be able to do out bootstra=
pping ?procedure for extracting ffvol. That's what  I did  for the function=
?a+A*(t+B)(-beta) (see my previous e-mail below). I'll try to come up with=
=20
parameter ranges for a+b*exp(-cx) as well.

Tanya,
            The exponentials we tried earlier (a+bexp(-cx), etc, fit well b=
ut=20
gave negative numbers in the bootstrapping.
            I tried a + b(t+c)(-1) , a standard power law, and as the ?acco=

Today's Focus: Cisco fixes bugs in switches and routers

I got an interesting response to a Network World column I
mentioned last week titled "Universal secure messaging will
rely on outsourcers." The column was written by James Kobielus,
who talked about authenticating digital signatures.

Reader John R. agrees with assumption in the column, saying
that for these signatures attached at the bottom of the message
to carry any weight, they need to be validated. To prove his
point, he attached a signature to his message. To the naked
eye, one would think it's OK. But, the signature was one he
pulled off an old CERT alert. Obviously, I don't check digital
signatures that vigorously.

John writes there are a couple other common foibles in dealing
with e-mail signatures:

* Assumption that if the "from: ID" is of a friend, it must have
been consciously sent by that person.

"Besides outright SMTP forgery (fakemail via port 25), it is
possible that another person is using the friend's system and
sent the e-mail, or that a software routine hooked into the
friend's e-mail account. The latter has been the [modus
operandi] of some recent worms and Trojans, "John writes.


* Failure to understand the difference between the userID and
the domain portions of an e-mail address.

"In one type of Web scam, a [perpetrator] gets, say, a Hotmail
or Juno account with a user ID that looks a lot like a trusted
company name. Naive people receive the email and think it is
from a trusted company. For example, a scam artist getting a
"Network_World@hotmail.com" address and passing himself off as
a Network World representative," he writes. "Loosely related to
the e-mail insecurities are some Web link tricks, but this is
for another time."

Thanks for the e-mail John. Maybe we'll have to start signing
our e-mails. You can read the Kobielus column at:

Today's bug patches and security alerts:


DoS bug in Cisco Catalyst switches

A bug exists in Cisco Catalyst switches that could allow a user
to launch a denial-of-service attack. If repeated, failed
telnet requests are made to the switch, the device could fail
to accept traffic and commands until rebooted. For more
information:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/catalyst-memleak-pub.shtml


Cisco fixes multiple vulnerabilities in CBOS

Cisco last week announced that it had fixed a number of holes
in CBOS, the operating system for its 600-series family of
routers. The problems range from possible SYN flood denial-of-
service vulnerabilities to a locking problem when a specific
URL is sent to the router. For more information:
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/CBOS-multiple.shtml


Microsoft releases tool for "SNMP Parameters" vulnerability

A bug in the way Windows 2000 handles some SNMP parameters
could allow a user in a network group to monitor or change
network service maliciously. This tool fixes the problem in the
registry key. For more information:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-096.asp

A similar vulnerability affects Windows NT 4.0 as well as
Version 4.0's RAS Administration Key and MTS Package
Administration key. Windows NT 4.0 users can find more
information and patches at:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-095.asp


Local root compromise in Lexmark MarkVision

The Lexmark MarkVision printer management utility for Unix
contains an overflow that could allow a user to gain root
access on the affected system. By exploiting the vulnerability,
the user could execute code as root. For fixes:
ftp://ftp.lexmark.com/pub/driver/unix/MarkVision/V4.4


New BitchX patches fix DoS vulnerability

The popular Linux IRC client BitchX contains two
vulnerabilities. First, a stack overflow exists in the client
that can be exploited if a malformed Domain Name System (DNS)
answer is processed. A second vulnerability allows the
malformed packets to be hidden by valid DNS packets. For more
information on BitchX:
http://www.bitchx.org/


Remote command vulnerability in phpGroupWare

According to an alert from Secure Reality, phpGroupWare makes
insecure calls to the include () function of PHP which can
allow the inclusion of remote files, and thereby the execution
of arbitrary commands on the remote web server with the
permissions of the Web server user, usually 'nobody'.
PhpGroupWare is a groupware program that combines calendar, e-
mail, file sharing and to do lists into one application. For a
patch:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7305


Conectiva releases fixed version of Bash

The Bash module for Linux contains vulnerability in its
creation of temporary files. The files are written in a
predictable manner and can be exploited by an attacker to
overwrite files on the affected system.

Caldera fixes problem in tcsh

The tcsh command writes insecure temporary files that can be
exploited via a symlink attack. This attack can be used to
overwrite arbitrary files. For updates:

Red Hat reports race condition in diskcheck

According to the Red Hat alert, a race vulnerability exists
where a user can replace the temp file used by diskcheck with
symlinks to other files on the system, making it possible to
corrupt those files.
Users of Red Hat Powertools 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 can download the
patch from:

Good morning everyone:

Several of us were talking and in order to help us get into the 
"Holiday Spirit" we thought it would be nice if each of us brought 
an appetizer, dessert, chips, popcorn, etc. or anything you desire, 
next Monday, the 18th.  We will put everything out in one of the 
conference rooms and celebrate ALL DAY!  Never mind about the 
calories - this is a once-a-year thing!  

This is not mandatory - just if you want to and if you remember!

Also, don't forget the "Holiday Party" at Damians on Tuesday night 
5:30 - 7:30 PM.

Have a great day!

Shirley

Vince,

I wanted to verify if you had received the DerivaPrice.com business plan
yet.  We felt a confidentiality agreement would not be necessary but we
would appreciate it still be kept confidential.

I have also attached a Power Point that summarizes the key points of the

Subject: internships at Enron?



Mr. Kindall:

I am a PhD student at GSIA whho has been working on modeling energy
commodities.

When you and Mr. Kaminski visited Carnegie Mellon, I had the opportunity
to talk with Mr. Kaminski about a model for electricity that I am trying
to develop. During our conversation, Mr. Kaminski suggested the
possibility of developing the model at Enron. I have tried contacting Mr. 
Kaminski
subsequently, to find out whether my working at Enron, possibly as an
intern, was still an option, but have been unable to reach him. I have his
email address as: vince.j.kaminski@enron.com. Is this the correct address?

Alternately, could I talk with someone else regarding internship
opportunities at Enron.

Thank You

Dear Project Sunrise Interviewees:

In order to complete gathering technical requirements, we will need to 
conduct some follow-up interviews.   I will be scheduling the interviews with 
all participants starting Wednesday December 6, 2000 to Monday, December 11, 
2000.  Tuesday, December 12th will be reserved for rescheduling of 
interviews.   

The interviews will be scheduled for 30 minutes and will be conducted by two 
members of the Project Sunrise technical team.   Before conducting the 
interviews, the technical team will review the documented interviews to 
determine any required missing information.    When possible, we will try to 
replace the followup interview with a followup email and/or phone call to 
limit your time commitment.  

Typical follow-up questions will be:   
What are your sources of data/information?  
Where is the data/information currently stored?  
Is the data/information automatically fed into SAP from another system?
Please provide samples of reports/queries (including detailed calculations) 
that demonstrate the information you desire.   

Please be prepared to answer the above mentioned questions and/or refer us to 
the appropriate parties so that we can all make the best use of our time.  
Please let me know your availability.  We will work around your schedule but 
would prefer to conduct the interviews 9:00 am to 2:00 pm to permit writeups 
to be done in the afternoon.  

Thank you very much for your participation and patience.  

Tzlem Mahmood

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

This e-mail is in reference to our telephone conversation on December 2, 
regarding possible opening at Enron Research (I was referred to you by 
Stinson Gibner).  Briefly, I am a geoscientist with Enron Global Exploration 
and Production (EGEP).  Enron Corp. recently decided to divest all of the 
EGEP's oil and gas assets and exit the upstream industry.  As a result, I am 
searching for a new position within Enron.  Having done some research on the 
activities of various groups at Enron, I think that my science background, 
experience and skills may be best suitable for the Enron Research Group.

I would appreciate your review of my resume (attached) and your comments 
about any job opportunity within Enron Research.  Please feel free to call me 
at ext. 67604 if you have any questions.  

Sincerely,

Freyd Rad

 I wanted to submit my notice of rotation to the "Fundamental Analysis" group 
and thank the FX and Country Risk group for giving me an opportunity to work 
in such exiting learning environment. I really enjoyed being part of the 
Research group and hope to keep all of the relationships I have developed 
throughout my rotation.   I am looking forward to my new position as an 
opportunity to learn more about the company and to try my abilities in a new 
environment. "Fundamental Analysis" group is a new and developing group, 
which will give me an opportunity to develop and grow as an employee.
 I understand that it is my responsibility to train the individual who will 
be taking my current position.  In an effort to make a smooth transition to 
my new rotation I will train the new individual and starting December 18th 
will devote my free time to pursue my new job responsibilities.  In agreement 
with Maureen official start date of new rotation is January 2nd  2001.

Sincerely,
Yana Kristal

This  summer may prove to be an especially?crucial period for the economy, 
with  the California power crisis possibly spreading to other regions and 
gasoline  prices likely to skyrocket.

This coupled  with continuing recessionary pressures in other sectors of the 
global economy  has greatly increased the importance of re-evaluating 
business strategies and  developing scenario plans to mitigate the growing 
financial  risks.

I am attaching  a list that highlights activities that?could be of value to 
you in this  environment.? If we?may be of  assistance to you, please do call

In a November 17, 2000, CERA multimedia conference call and web presentation, 
Ed Kelly, CERA Director, and 
Bryan Sanderson, CERA Associate, discuss: 

WINTER WEATHER SCENARIOS: BRACING FOR THE STORM 
* Demand potential under cold, normal, and warm weather 
conditions this winter. A return to normal weather will 
push demand well above last year's levels. 
* Storage outlook. How low can it go? 
* Price. Limited demand flexibility and low storage 
levels will continue to drive prices through the winter.

Hi Vince,

It been awhile since we have spoken, hope all has been going great for
you.

I left a voice message on this conference subject with you.  We want to
invite you to speak at our conference.

Thought you might like to take a look at the preliminary agenda so I am
attaching that to this email.

This is the fourth year of our conference.  It has grown in quality and
attendance each year.  The conference is held at Skamania lodge, which
is about 45 minutes from the Portland airport.

Basically, we expect an attendance of about 70-80 individuals from the
US and Canada.  We get a broad spectrum of attendance both
geographically and functionally.  It is an excellent opportunity for
networking and building knowledge about electric markets.  All of the
presentations are very well attended.

We strive also for a broad spectrum of high quality speakers.  Many have
no relation with EPIS, we simply are looking for the best speakers we
can find.  We have a high respect for you and know that you would
greatly add to the value of our conference.  It has always been a
pleasure to work with you in the past.  For this conference, we would
consult with you to develop a speaking topic that would fit with your
desires and with our program.

As a speaker, your conference fees would be handled by us.  And the
conference fees include all meals except one dinner.  You would handle
the travel and hotel.

We also provide some opportunity for relaxation with a catered
reception/dinner at the Columbia Gorge Interpretive Center, which
overlooks the gorge and is filled with great history and information
about the spectacular gorge, and on the second evening an informal/fun
golf tournament (included in the conference fees) for those who are
interested.

We hope that you would give this your consideration, and we look forward
to hearing from you.

Thanks

Warren

Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects 
which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of 
Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and 
maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to 
its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services 
offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of 
deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.  

Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would 
feature similar assets and services.
SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers 
that comprise each segment. 
The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific 
projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list 
represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried 
from PCCS.
The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related 
assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities 
have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs, 
Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly.
Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption 
of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all 
assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real 
estate segment.





Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and 
Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation 
product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.  
Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.

Thanks.

Richard

Today's focus: Network management goes open source
---------------------------------------------
By Phil Hochmuth

A beta version of Open Network Management Software's Bluebird
management tool last week was released to the open source
community for testing in network environments.

Bluebird's creators intend the software to be an open-source
alternative to large network management platforms, such as
Tivoli, HP's OpenView and Aprisma's Spectrum. Bluebird uses
standards-based technologies - including Java in the core
application engine and XML in the reporting and interface
modules - which make applications less bulky and more
customizable than proprietary network management platforms,
OpenNMS developers claim.  Also, as with all open-source
programs, the source code is freely available, allowing users
to modify and customize the software even further.

Bluebird runs with PostgreSQL 7.0, a freely available SQL
database popular with open-source software users. Bluebird is
also compatible with the Oracle8i database.

Bluebird 0.4 is based on SNMP, and is designed to manage small
networks of up to 500 networked devices. The software requires
no "agents," or monitoring software, to run on the devices it
monitors. This could help to make the deployment and
maintenance of the system easier than agent-based management
products.

The Bluebird software performs an array of management tasks,
such as discovering TCP/IP devices in a network, device
filtering, and service-level monitoring for enforcing service-
level agreements from a service provider. Reporting tools allow
users to make charts and reports about their network's
performance over a period of time. The software includes a
Java2 real-time reporting console that gives users a live view
of events and traffic patterns in a network.

A calendar function is included, which can be used to schedule
network tasks, such as system backups and automated software
upgrades.

OpenNMS software is based on Java2, so it can run on an array
of platforms, including Linux, Windows NT/2000 and Sun Solaris.

OpenNMS expects Version 1.0 of Bluebird to be released in the
first quarter of 2001. The production version of the software
will have a distributed architecture, where multiple Bluebird
servers are deployed and tasks are divvied up among distributed
machines. Version 1.0 will also support networks with thousands
of TCP/IP nodes.

Canadian Arctic Natural Gas Development Proceeds

   Oil companies that are planning to tap the vast natural gas
reserves in the Canadian Arctic say they will soon move past the
study stage and could start preparing a regulatory application for a
multibillion-dollar pipeline early next year. The group, which
includes Imperial Oil, Gulf Canada Resources, Shell Canada and Exxon
Mobil, started studying how to develop the 6 Tcf of reserves in the
Mackenzie Delta region of the Northwest Territories about a year ago.
Over the past year, other oil companies have amassed large land
positions in the region, expecting a pipeline with a capacity of more
than 1 Bcf per day to be built to southern markets along the
Mackenzie River Valley. At the same time, major oil companies led by
BP Amoco are formulating plans for developing their own reserves at
Prudhoe Bay in northern Alaska, along with a pipeline. Last week, BP,
Exxon Mobil and Phillips said they had joined forces to study
construction of a pipeline to tap over 35 Tcf of Alaska natural gas.
Industry debate has centered on which resources would be developed
first, and whether they need to go ahead together. Governments,
companies, northern communities and aboriginal groups all have stakes
in any development that takes place, and the most optimistic guess as
to when volumes could start flowing is at least five years. The
Imperial-led group says it has already carried out extensive and open
discussions with more than 70 parties representing a variety of
interests. Imperial said the study was aided by the consortium's
relationship with the Aboriginal Pipeline Group, which represents
more than 30 native leaders from the Northwest Territories.
Meanwhile, the group had examined various issues related to pipeline
funding and ownership, with the aim of making capacity available to
all producers in the region. In addition, the companies drew up a
draft regulatory road map to streamline that process.

Natural Gas Storage

    The AGA is expected to report that natural gas storage levels
decreased by about 150 to 180 Bcf when its report is released this
afternoon. Last week, the AGA reported storage at 2,429 Bcf for the
week ending December 1st, down 73 Bcf from the previous week, and
down 503 Bcf  from 1999. With blizzard conditions across much of the
nation this week, next weeks withdrawal is expected to be even
larger, likely exceeding 200 Bcf. If that is the case, storage levels
could drop below 2 Tcf before winter even officially begins. The AGA
reported a 73 Bcf withdrawal for the comparable period a year ago.
The five-year average is 68 Bcf. Last week, the producing region's
storage decreased 11 Bcf to 611 Bcf, 64% of capacity. Producing
storage levels are now 226 Bcf below a year ago. The eastern
consuming region had a withdrawal of 57 Bcf to 1,495 Bcf, 81% of
capacity and 163 Bcf below a year ago. The western region storage
levels decreased by 5 Bcf to 323 Bcf, 64% of capacity. Western region
storage levels are now 114 Bcf lower than a year ago.

TETCO Plans Incremental Expansion Project for Mid-Atlantic and Northeast

    Texas Eastern Transmission plans an open season for its Texas
Eastern Incremental Market Expansion, or TIME, a new project to bring
additional supplies of natural gas to the growing mid-Atlantic and
Northeast markets. TIME will combine unsubscribed existing capacity
with incremental firm capacity to create a low-cost expansion option
for Texas Eastern shippers. During the open season from December
11th  January 12th, shippers can submit non-binding nominations to
move volumes from the Gulf Coast, Chicago/Lebanon lateral and other
receipt points on the TETCO system to delivery points in the
Northeast.  By utilizing existing capacity that initially served
Midwest markets, TIME will enable TETCO to reconfigure its existing
pipeline system and with modest additions to existing facilities
provide significant increased capacity to mid-Atlantic and Northeast
markets at existing approved rates. In recent years, the Northeast
and mid-Atlantic markets have experienced renewed growth in
traditional markets as well as the construction of new electric
generation.  With its ability to bring the capacity to market
quickly, TIME is well-positioned to capture this growth.

Meet the head of the leading firm in our business.

Imagine the opportunity!

Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run 
the  company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North 
America.

So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a 
co-owner assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or 
three.

To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a 
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower's wares.  You do an IPO and take in 
about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is over and the quiet period 
it required.  But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your 
energy at the best price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get 
up front 30 Enron-trained   risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine 
having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene 
Lockhart,  most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before 
that president of BankAmerica's Global Retail Bank with its consumer, 
commercial and small business banking services delivered through 3,000+ 
branches.

Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.

Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in detail 
(to read the full story see attachment):

? How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is the 
heart of NewPower's business plan?
? How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
? How he's going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million 
by the end of 2001.
? What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What figure 
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
? Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest the 
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated 
retail  marketer in the US.
? How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
? What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
? What does he see as his biggest challenge?
? Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
? Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
? What's the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
? Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill, 
what kind of margin can it make now?
? How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We're actually in a very good 
position given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our 
favor ... "
? "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a 
bill, collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone 
else in the industry by several orders of magnitude."

Ken Rice received a call through a friend's referral from Dr. Tom Limperis (a 
professor at the University of Michigan).  Dr. Limperis has developed a 
statistical database management system he would like to show Enron.  Ken 
would like you to return this call on his behalf.  He feels that you are 
probably the only person who will understand and be able to determine if 
Enron should have an interest.

Do you mind returning this call?  Please let me know.

>From http://www.enerfax.com:

Northwest Spot Power Prices Rise

   Spot power prices in the Pacific Northwest continued higher
yesterday amid unit outages and strong natural gas prices. A
projected weekend outage at the 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon Unit 2 nuclear
power plant and a 10-day outage at the 820 MW IPP Unit 1 coal power
plant should keep supplies scarce heading into next week. At COB,
power for today rose over $15 to $270. Power sold at Mid-Columbia for
today was up $15 at $267. Concern is mounting about the possibility
of a dry year in the Pacific Northwest, which could keep prices high
into the spring. In the Southwest, power prices declined amid lower
day-ahead demand. According to the California PX, demand  will peak
at 32,435 MW today. Palo Verde slipped $36 to $137 per MWh, while
Mead traded down $32 at $146 per MWh.

Alliance Begins Commercial Operations

    Alliance pipeline is finally ready to begin commercial shipment
of Canadian natural gas to Chicago from northern British Columbia
today and operators are already talking about expanding the system.
Originally scheduled to begin flowing in October, the delayed opening
is set for the pipeline to begin transporting today. The addition of
the $3 billion Alliance pipeline's capacity curbed price increases at
Chicago yesterday relative to spikes in the Northeast. Cold weather
headed for the East Coast triggered a 9% price jump in the region's
prices yesterday.
Prices at the New York City gate surged $0.75 per MMBtu to a record
high of $7.20, while Chicago prices were only Up $0.35 at $6.41 per
MMBtu. Canada supplies about 16% of US natural gas. Alliance is one
of two new pipelines beginning operations this week. BC Gas C$375
million Southern Crossing Pipeline from eastern British Columbia to
the West Coast began pumping 250 MMcf per day on Thursday in
competition with Westcoast Energy. For its part, the Alliance system
is seen by some as a key link in the eventual transport of Arctic
natural gas to market. BP Amoco has assumed the transportation
responsibilities of eight shippers on the pipeline whose volumes
total more than 250 MMcf per day, and plans to increase that amount.
Alliance partners include Westcoast Energy, 23.6%; Enbridge, 21.4%;
Fort Chicago Energy Partners, 26%; Williams, 14.6%; and Coastal,
14.4%.

We will be adding Southern Crossing to the next base case.

Also, some corrections are needed in our Alliance model.  Further research
shows that the maximum receipt capacity from B.C. to be about 300 / day
(9,120 / month) and from A.B. to be 1,950 / day (59,280).  Alliance
receives no supplies in the Northwest Territories and has no plans for
doing so.  The only existing connection to NWT is into Westcoast.  I would
change its capacity to 400 / day (12,160 / month), increasing to 500 / day
(15,200) in 2002.  Nova (TCPL Alberta System) is considering an extension
into NWT in the future.  The current base case shows a need for more than
500 / day starting in 2006.  So, I've set up a supply link from NWT into
Nova at 300 / day starting in 2006.


Pollution Credits Shutting Down California Power Plants

    AES says output from three of its power plants in southern
California has been cut in half due to a shortage of pollution
credits. AES Pacific has curtailed 2,000 MW of a total capacity of
4,000 MW at its three natural-gas fired plants in the Los Angeles
area, Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach. The move followed
the filing of a petition by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District related to its Alamitos plant which had exceeded its NOX
emission allocation. Both Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach were
close to reaching their NOX allocations. The plants could operate if
the California ISO declared a power emergency.  An arbitration board
is due to rule in late December on the air quality district's
petition. California has been struggling to meet surging demand for
power this year. There have also been few power plants built during
the last decade and the California ISO has had to issue numerous
power alerts this year as operating reserves dropped to critical
levels. The California ISO says a number of other plants are also
running out of pollution credits.

Coastal to Buy Pipe for Gulfstream

     Coastal has agreed to buy steel pipe for the Gulfstream natural
gas pipeline from Berg Steel Pipe Corp for $310 million. Coastal's
774-mile pipeline will run from Mobile, AL across the Gulf of Mexico
to Tampa. Duke and Williams, which had been developing a competing
project, agreed earlier this month to buy Coastal's pipeline. Terms
were not disclosed. Coastal's purchase was for the 36-inch diameter
pipeline to run through the Gulf of Mexico and the 36-inch and 30-
inch pipe for Florida. Pipe production will start immediately with
delivery starting early next year in Port Manatee, Florida, and
Mobile. All of the pipe is scheduled for delivery by September, and
the pipeline is scheduled to start by June 2002. Coastal plans to
complete the sale of the Gulfstream system this quarter.

According to Williams' Buccaneer website, upon closure of the purchase of
Gulfstream by Williams - Duke, Gulfstream will be built in lieu of
Buccaneer.  Our next base case database will reflect this change.

Power Marketers Accused of Manipulating Prices

    Enron, PG&E Energy Trading, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing,
Sempra Energy Trading and Dynegy Power Marketing are among a dozen
energy companies accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to manipulate
California wholesale electricity prices.  The lawsuit claims
companies selling electricity in California intentionally limited
supply to drive up prices. The suit seeks certification as a class
action covering all electricity consumers in California, estimates
damages in excess of $1 billion. The allegations in the lawsuit are
based on a number of studies of the state's electricity market that
concluded it was not functioning normally. Southern California Edison
and PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric filed suit against state officials
separately last month for permission to charge customers billions of
dollars for losses from open-market power purchases.

Hi Vince,

Sorry that we couldn't meet in Houston.  Hope your Philadelphia trip was
fruitful and you didn't suffer from weather related flight delays on your
way back to Houston.  Your phone message stated that you may be coming to NY
in Jan. 2001.  That's great & we should definitely plan to see each other in
NY, unless I come to Houston first.  I'd, however, appreciate a brief chat
today and pls call me if you schedule permits.

I'll be heading out to London tomorrow (mainly for the holidays) and won't
be back to the office until Thurs. 1/4, however, I'll be checking my phone-
and e-mail occasionally during the trip.

If today is not convenient, pls call me @ home tomorrow morning until
11:00am (NY time) and otherwise, pls offer another suitable time next week,
your tel. # , and I can call you from London.

Have a great and a very happy holiday season.

Best regards,

Soussan,
914 253 4187 (work)

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place

problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Dear Ms. Crenshaw,

On November 28, I sent Vince Kaminski an email inviting him to visit Baylor 
University (where I now hold an appointment as Professor of Finance & 
Insurance; having resigned from LSU this pas spring).? I have yet to receive 
a reply from him.? Can you bring this email (copied below) to his attention?

Thanks,

Jim Garven

===========================

Dear Vince,

Since we last corresponded, I have left LSU and am now Professor of Finance & 
Insurance at Baylor University in Waco, TX. My colleague at Baylor, John 
Martin, mentioned that you will be coming to campus for a conference on 
Friday, February 23 that he is organizing. I am curious whether your schedule 
might permit staying over that evening so that we can feature you as our 
dinner speaker for the chartering ceremony of Gamma Iota Sigma, a national 
risk management fraternity. For that matter, would you also possibly be 
available to make any presentations to undergraduate and graduate students on 
the previous day (Thursday, February 22)? What I have in mind is a 
presentation similar to the presentations you made last spring to my LSU 
classes. 

Thank you for your consideration of this request. I am looking forward to 
seeing you once again. 

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

On behalf of the Jones Graduate School at Rice University, we would like to 
thank all of the company representatives who have submitted Action Learning 
Project (ALP) proposals. Currently, the ALP faculty committee is reviewing 
all proposals received.

We also want to remind those who are planning to submit proposals of our 
December 1st deadline. Please keep us updated on the status of your project. 
We are happy to answer any questions or provide assistance. 

Our goal is to have a good mix of projects from a variety of companies, and 
we are also pleased to accept multiple projects from one company. Thus far, 
many of our proposals are marketing and/or strategy related. To increase the 
diversity of projects, we are especially looking for ideas that give our 
students the opportunity to utilize finance skills. Of course, an ideal 
project is one that allows a student to use multiple skills.

Again, thank you for your continued interest in Rice University and the Jones 
School ALP program.

Hi Vasant,

 How are you?  Sorry to hear that you are getting swamped with work.

 I am doing my best to spend time with the Enron Credit team to learn about 
their current (public firm) models.  In addition, I have begun to review 
various econometrics approaches that may be applicable to the private firm 
models (PCA, PLS, Cluster analysis, etc.).  Also, at the suggestion of Vince 
and Slava, I am trying to work on the overall "strategic plan" (aka the 
Duffie document).

 Amitava suggested that we might want to have a conference call on Tuesday 
with Bryan, Markus and Vince to get an update on their ever changing strategy 
and data needs.  Amitava said that he would ask Anita to coordinate this 
conference call.

 Let me know if there is anything else you would like for me to do while I am 
here.

Take care,
Iris

Tom:

I do not think Vince has any plans to go to UT the rest of this year.  Would
Professor Lasdon be interested in coming to Houston?   They sometimes
do that if they have something they really want to discuss with him.

If not,  I will forward this to Vince and keep him in mind for the next trip.

Thanks!

Shirley,
Leon Lasdon would like to meet Vince sometime when Vince is at UT Austin.   
He'd like to find out more about what we do, and of course is looking for 
opportunities for research projects and summer interns.  I am planning to 
visit him sometime soon as he has an interesting hydro modelling project.

Leon is a well known person in the optimization world - his nonlinear solver 
is used in Excel, he's written text books (I used it lots during my thesis 
work), and he is a Professor in the Department of Management Science and 
Information Systems at Austin.  tel 512 471 9433, email 
lasdon@mail.utexas.edu.

FYI. This is the first meeting with everyone including leaders (steering 
committee). It would be mostly a discussion of status quo ( what they call 
"Is" process). Should be ok if you can't attend.

a "ra-ra" meeting. Our company offers you an opportunity that can
be operated from in-front of your computer screen.

Niamh, 
I examined how VAR of "Financial Products" portfolio depends on 
term-structure of correlations between BRENT and 61NY. Here are the results 
(for positions on 11/6/00):

1). If we assume correlations of 1 across all forward contacts for Brent and 
61NY
as well as between Brent and 61NY for all maturities,

VAR=$424,199

2). If we calculate correlations based on first 18 contracts prices for both 
Brent and 61NY
together and assume longer maturity contracts are all perfectly correlated, 
then

VAR=$1,868,949

3). Same as (2) but correlations are based on 12 first contracts, everything 
beyond that is perfectly correlated, then:

VAR=$1,106,773.

Conclusion 1:  when we use higher correlations, VAR goes down (as we 
expected).
Conclusion 2: correlations depend on how many forward contracts we use to 
calculate them. We should use all liquidly traded contracts, because prices 
for those contain statistically reliable information.

I chose 18 initially, what is your suggestion?

Regards,

Tanya.

Dear Vince

Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning a complimentary pass to the
two-day GARP Convention. Unfortunately, it is not GARP's policy to allow
this for a number of reasons: GARP is a not-for-profit organisation, will
much lower delegate fees (and still the same overheads) than other
conference organizers. GARP's mission is to allow an educational forum for
furtherance of financial risk management and an opportunity to allow
networking and contact time between financial risk professionals. However,
in an attempt to remain at ease with my speakers, I would like to offer a
50% discount off the delegate fee for one of you colleagues in Enron. This
will be for the two-day Convention and will include the Gala Awards Evening
on 13th February, which had over three financial and risk professionals at
GARP 2000.

I trust that this is satisfactory. If you would like to take advantage of
this, please fax a completed registration form, along with a brief covering
note referring to this e-mail, and I will ensure that our administration
depart handle the relevant paper work. If you have any questions please do
not hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to your response and to meeting you in New York in February
(and receiving a copy of your presentation in a few days).

Kind regards

Andreas,

Am I entitled to bringing one delegate as a guest, free of charge?
Some conferences offer such privileges.

Vince

Subject:  GARP 2001 Convention



Dear GARP 2001 Speaker

This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th
February, 2001.

Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP
2000. There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention.
Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a
result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention
earlier this year. The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management
Forum  are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I
will of  course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of
the  event.

Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:

1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and
New York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure
you can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to
be taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required
as soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you
bring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy
disc or a laptop.

2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what
audio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection -
notably PowerPoint).

3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact
me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.

I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.

Kind regards

Andreas
