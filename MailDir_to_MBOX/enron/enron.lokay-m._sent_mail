Kevin,
After updating TWDP database to July 2000,  I noticed that there are 
contracts without deal makers information.
Would you please have someone update deal maker information for the following

Please let me know when it's done so I can rerun.

Hi Mike,

Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just 
got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave 
temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!

How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you 
love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be 
speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and 
financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much 
shorter!

Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?!

Michelle,

Since I didn't get to say good-bye, I wanted to see how you were doing?  It
sounds like you landed on your feet pretty fast.  To be nosey, were you able
to get a severance package and then become employed that quickly?  The
speculation around here was that you already had the Enron job (i.e., may
have given notice already) and Will severed you because of the soft landing
scheduled (heck, I would have loved to be in your situation).

I guess you know that Will officially left the company.  Another speculation
was that he tried to garner a severance package himself, but they turned him
down (of course he was furious, but I don't know if it was true).

What exactly are you doing with Enron?  Is it in a Marketing role?  Randa
mentioned that you are travelling some, but didn't really know what your job
function entailed.

Periodically keep in touch because inquiring minds like to know (and I might
use you for some research).

Regards,
Mike Triem

Thanks again for your help on getting the well connected ASAP.  For the
weekend, we estimate we will be flowing around 34,000 mmbtu/day.
We have been replacing wellhead equipment and dehy's to allow for greater
production.
Hopefully this flow will continue for awhile.
We are selling the production at the interconnect, hopefully TW is getting
a good transport rate.  Earlier today, i could have paid TW $4.00/mmbtu
transport, got any FT?  $10.50 at the border, $5.50 at TW. Makes your FT
west shippers rich.

I know we have had numerous discussions with gas control, Michelle, field
people, etc.  Tell everyone thanks for the hard work.

Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!!  
Yes, let's allget together soon...call me! 

Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was 
a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting 
much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all 
three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every 
night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one?

Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven't
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I've seen "Perfect
Storm" and "The Patriot" .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.

Yesterday's meeting concluded that real time fuel project should use socket 
to communicate
wtih SCADA to be in sync with other real time application in the group. 
Steve Littel sent his VB codes to me and I am working on it.

I asked Joe Zhou about TW Deal Analysis on Window 2000.  He said there should 
be no problem.
Window 2000 should have IE 5.0 features.

Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25.  
They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher 
energy prices!  Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today.

Hello Marketing,
I'm looking for feedback regarding the TW Deal Profitability model.  There 
were some problems a few weeks ago but I'm assuming they have been resolved 
since no one is saying anything.

Have there been any problems accessing the website?  Are there any issues 
you'd like to raise?  The sooner I know, the sooner we can get started on 
improving/troubleshooting the model.

I'm not sure I have all the users on the mailing list so please inform those 
I may have inadvertently left out.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Ken

Sorry about my incomplete memo (I hit send instead of save).

Anyway, we would like to set-up a two hour meeting for Thursday, August 3rd 
to discuss the variables for modeling westward throughput on TW (to forecast 
fuel).  This will be a brainstorming session to discuss the various impacts 
on the level of throughput, such as, hydro levels, weather, prices, 
seasonality, etc.  Please let me know if morning or afternoon on the 3rd is 
good for you.

Thanks,

Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at maximum tariff rate for 
California deliveries.  Took advantage of widening market basis spreads; will 
generate $2.7 million in revenue.  Because the original terms had ROFR 
language dictating up to max rate only, included was a revenue sharing 
mechanism if contract is ever released above max rate.  The mechanism 
provides an opportunity to generate market based transport. 
Settled dispute with Burlington involving volume commitments under various 
pipeline pressures.  Dispute was originally at $3 million dollars, negotiated 
potential damages down to $100,000 in credits on prior transport invoices.  
Deal also included re-execution of Interconnect and Operating Agreement for 
lower volume commitments based on seasonality, thereby eliminating future 
potential dollar exposure.
Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 30,000/day of 
supply on east end of system.  Potential opportunity for future transport or 
park and ride agreement.
Worked with Accounts Receivable to identify outstanding facility invoices.  
Located over $600,000 on Northern.  
Executed agreement with Cima Energy to be a new customer on Transwestern.
Worked as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system.  
System now is also linked with the Risk Management System with weekly basis 
quote feed to ensure more real time data.
Co-ordinated Open Seasons with internal and external contacts.  Worked with 
programmers to enhance IOS system to handle maximum rate bidding and other 
e-commerce efforts.
Provide backup to both Short Term deal origination and contract processing.
Working with Eprime and SPS on potential power plant interconnect of up to 
200,000/day on east end of system.
Working with Eprime to become a new shipper on system from San Juan to East 
of Thoreau.
Monitor daily basis differentials to maximize additional transport rate 
opportunities.
Working with Market Services and Contract Administration to identify 
underutilized transport agreements for additional marketing opportunities.

Michelle:

The intial agreement Bob presented to EOG was for $10,000, this was to cover 
the cost to refurbishing the existing 6" tap.  The work order was generated 
with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner 
notification letter ASAP.  EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were 
to supply all materials to re-activate this point.   A scope change was 
intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube,  a verbal cost 
estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed.  A third scope change 
raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install 
additional instrumentation.  Operations at this time insisted we add the 
needed equipment to the work order.  The E&C folks then put out the tighter 
cost estimate of $422,000.  This included the following cost revisions:

 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total   $423,000

Call me if you have any questions, PT 3-0667.

Subject: RSVP: August 25 - Introduction to the Electric Industry


By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.

Great Expectations
Forbes - 10/16/2000
BY Lynn Cook
Copyright 2000 Forbes Inc.

ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT 
pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs 
in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and 
data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands 
of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded 
message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing 
the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to 
translate voice mail into e-mail.

The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to 
go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial 
offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and 
now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover. 

Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. 
Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran 
Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq 
Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet 
connections to its iPAQ Pocket.

Subject: Problems with the Deal Profitability Model?

Hello Marketing,
I'm looking for feedback regarding the TW Deal Profitability model.  There 
were some problems a few weeks ago but I'm assuming they have been resolved 
since no one is saying anything.

Have there been any problems accessing the website?  Are there any issues 
you'd like to raise?  The sooner I know, the sooner we can get started on 
improving/troubleshooting the model.

I'm not sure I have all the users on the mailing list so please inform those 
I may have inadvertently left out.  I look forward to hearing from you.
Thanks,
Ken

Michelle is it possible to evaluate a park-n-ride in deal profitability?  If 
not would this be valuable?  If it would be Mei-Ling and I would like to meet 
with you to understand what we might have to modify.

Do you know  about the variable costs?  I don't think any of the Park and 
Rides have ever been analyzed in Deal Profitability?!?!

Kim,

You might want to get on the distribution of this report.  I have wondered 
and asked the question "Do we always cover variable operating costs on our 
park and ride deals"?  A ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use.  
Doesn't the Deal Analysis cover park & ride deals?  You might want to check 
into this.

Thanks........Terry

Subject: base differential for TW deal analysis



Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Mei-Ling

Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and 
they'd said "No Coverage" on Dental.  I think I am all set.  If you find out 
otherwise, let me know!  Thanks.

Subject: Dashboard and Internet Explorer 5.01 upgrade. Houston

On Monday, December 4th, a new version of the Marketing Dashboard will be 
rolled out. In order for this new version of The Dashboard to work you will 
need to have Internet Explorer 5.01(IE5.01) loaded on your system. If you 
already have IE5.01, PLEASE RESPOND, to this message  with a confirmation 
that you have IE5.01 or higher loaded. (No other action on your part is 
necessary)

If you DO NOT have IE5.01 please follow the instructions below to install it 
. then respond to this email that IE5 has been loaded. 

If you are uncomfortable doing the upgrade alone or are unsure what version 
of IE you have please call the helpdesk 87-7454 and someone will assist you.

Again please respond to this message ASAP - we are looking to have everyone 
in Houston upgraded by Dec 1st. The total process takes less that 15 
minutes.  If you have any question, comments or concerns please contact the 
helpdesk at 87-7454, 

Thank you

Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.
