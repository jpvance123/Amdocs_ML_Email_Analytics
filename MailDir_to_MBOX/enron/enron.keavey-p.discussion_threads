Special situations

These tips for identifying investment opportunities will help you find
stocks that can move up even when the stock market is flat on its back.

By Michael Sivy

As long-time readers of this column know, I like to focus mainly on the
biggest, most financially healthy companies. Such blue-chip growth stocks
are well-followed by Wall Street analysts and by the media, so their
prospects are generally reflected in the share price. Occasionally,
however, those stocks get undervalued -- but they generally return to fair
valuations within a few years. If you buy them when they're down, odds are
you'll at least match -- and probably slightly outpace -- the general
market over a decade or longer. (For a list of the stocks I think are most
worth tracking, see the Sivy 100.)
[ http://www.money.com/sivy100/ ]

There are, however, smart ways to enhance that basic strategy. Some
investors, for example, search for so-called "special situations," stocks
that will rise or fall based on unique events, like a takeover bid or a
corporate restructuring. Anticipating such events takes some savvy, but
there are guideposts that can help. One excellent source for those tips is
The Superstock Investor, a new book by Charles LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon,
published by McGraw Hill.

I've known Charlie for more than a decade and he's spotted a lot of great
opportunities, particularly among midcap and smaller stocks that aren't
well followed by analysts. In fact, I featured one of his recommendations
in Sivy on Stocks last November 8 -- United Industrial [UIC], a small
defense-related company with little debt. Since then, the stock has risen
40 percent to $16 a share.

Since every special situation is different, the best way to learn about
them is to read through a lot of case studies -- and Charlie's book is full
of them. But he also lists a number of signs to watch for that can help you
identify a stock poised for big gains. The most important thing to remember
is that a special situation needs a catalyst that can unlock its value.
Here are 10 potential triggers:

* An outside investor files a 13-D form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, revealing that it has accumulated more than 5 percent of a
company's stock.

* A company with one outsider that owns more than 5 percent of the stock
attracts other investors who buy big stakes.

* An outside owner announces that it is seeking ways to enhance shareholder
value or expresses an interest in selling its stake.

* A dispute about the best way to get the stock price up breaks out between
a company's management and a major outside shareholder.

* A company with one or more large outside owners announces a stock buyback
program, giving more influence to the biggest shareholders who will push to
get the stock price up.

* A company in a consolidating industry sells or spins off non-core assets,
thereby turning itself into a pure play that is likely to be even more
attractive to potential acquirers.

* A company in a consolidating industry announces a restructuring charge
that causes its share price to decline substantially, making the stock
highly attractive to potential acquirers.

* A company in a consolidating industry is partially owned by a brokerage
or buyout firm that could devise a strategy to boost the value of its stake.

* The founder of a company who owns more than 10 percent of the stock
passes away, removing potential opposition to an acquisition.

* A company that owns a stake in another company is itself acquired,
leading the acquirer to try to raise cash by selling the stake and putting
the company in play.

None of these factors by itself is a reason to invest in a company. But if
the stock is attractive on fundamental grounds, the chance that it will
turn out to be a special situation provides an enormous kicker.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com 
November 17, 2000

Whirlybird

With the outlook so uncertain, it's time to hunt for value. And Textron, a 
conglomerate that makes Cessna airplanes and Bell helicopters, fills the bill.

By Michael Sivy

The outcome of the election is still uncertain. So are the Fed's intentions 
for interest rates. And the economy is the most uncertain of all. In such an 
investing climate, it makes a lot of sense to add a little ballast to your 
portfolio, in the form of value stocks. One of the most attractive picks 
today is the industrial conglomerate ( [ 
http://quote.money.com/money/quote/qc?symbols=TXT ] )Textron. 

Conglomerates are often penalized because analysts like companies they can 
fit into specific industry groups. And Textron is tough to pigeonhole. The 
company gets 40 percent of its operating earnings from industrial businesses; 
30 percent from aircraft manufacturing, including Cessna airplanes and Bell 
helicopters; 19 percent from automotive, and 11 percent from financial 
services. 
?
It's a broad mix, but all together, the pieces are producing solid results. 
The aircraft division is flying highest, with revenue up 22 percent and 
profits up 40 percent in the third quarter. The outlook is quite bright, with 
order backlogs rising modestly for both Cessna airplanes and Bell 
helicopters, and profit margins improving slightly. Prospects are also 
attractive for the smallest division, financial services. 
?
The other two divisions have been performing much less impressively because 
of the developing economic slowdown. Automotive showed only a 1 percent 
revenue gain in the third quarter. And though the industrial division managed 
15 percent revenue growth in the quarter, income actually decreased 2 
percent. In addition to the weak economy, a spate of recent acquisitions has 
temporarily depressed that division's profitability. 
?
Textron expects the economy to remain sluggish going into 2001. So to bolster 
its results -- particularly for the industrial division -- Textron is 
developing an extensive cost-cutting and restructuring plan to be implemented 
over the next five quarters. Moreover, Textron has been steadily repurchasing 
stock and intends to continue doing so. Because the price is so low -- the 
stock is down 30 percent year-to-date -- those buybacks can contribute 
significantly to growth in earnings per share. 
?
For the third quarter, total earnings per share rose 14 percent. And with its 
restructuring plans, Textron aims to maintain that rate over the next five 
years. Currently the stock yields 2.4 percent, so Textron shareholders have a 
good shot at a total return averaging as much as 16 percent annually. 

Given those return prospects -- which beat both the market's long-term 
average and the current outlook for the S&P 500 -- Textron looks like a 
compelling choice for conservative investors. With a lot of exposure to 
manufacturing, this conglomerate won't be immune to a prolonged economic 
slowdown. But forecasts assume at least some sluggish economic patches and 
the valuation is tough to beat. At $53.25 a share, the stock trades at 11.4 
times this year's estimated earnings and only about 10 times next year's 
projected results. There are electric utilities offering only half the growth 
that trade for more.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
May 7, 2001

Higher Flyer

Top techs such as Nokia may not look cheap by traditional valuation
measures. But they may still be good buys.

By Michael Sivy

Value is a relative term. Every once in a while, you get a chance to buy
shares in a company with annual earnings growth of more than 20 percent at
a price/earnings ratio of 16 or less. But that doesn't happen very often.
Most of the time, conservative investors are lucky to find 14 percent
growth at a 16 P/E. Slightly more aggressive investors might be happy with
18 percent growers at P/Es in the low 20s. The most successful growth
stocks, however, may never fall all the way down to those cheap valuations.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy them.

In fact, there are good reasons to devote at least a part of your portfolio
to those kinds of high flyers. For one thing, those companies are typically
among the world's most successful. In addition, they receive ongoing
support and sponsorship from Wall Street analysts. As long as they continue
to meet expectations, they will hold up fairly well in temporary market
downturns. And they will be among the first stocks to bounce back.

A perfect case in point looks to be Nokia [NOK]. The Finnish giant is the
most successful firm in one of the world's most rapidly growing industries.
And since 1997, Nokia's share of the global wireless-phone handset market
has risen from less than 20 percent to 35 percent, helping the company
nearly double earnings per share since 1998.

Of course, no company can increase its market share indefinitely, but there
are several factors that should help sustain Nokia's superior profit
growth. Since most everyone who would use a cell phone already has one, the
bulk of the sales of cell phones using existing technology is replacement
business. And when existing users switch phones, they tend to maintain
brand loyalty -- if they change providers at all, they migrate toward the
strongest one (say from Ericsson to Nokia, but not the other way around).
As a result, Nokia could gain another couple of market share points in
current-technology handsets.

Even more important, the company is capable of attaining a market share
topping 40 percent in the next generation of handsets -- both those that
use more sophisticated technology for voice transmission and those that
will provide paging, instant messaging, and Internet access. Overall, the
handset market is projected to grow at an annual compound rate of just
under 23 percent over the next four years. And with market share gains,
Nokia's sales should do even better.

In the past few quarters, the over-capacity problems that have plagued the
telecom industry have been hurting handset makers as well as service
providers. Not only has growth slowed -- total sales of cell phones were up
only 12 percent in the first quarter -- but the introduction of new
technology is being delayed. As a result, Nokia's earnings, up just 15
percent in the first quarter, will likely fall short of a 20 percent gain
for the year as a whole.

Once the current slump passes, however, Nokia's growth should recover to
nearly 25 percent a year. And so, despite a P/E of 40 based on estimated
earnings for the current year, the stock seems quite attractive. At $33,
Nokia is trading at just over half the level it was a year ago. And the
share price, which dipped as low as $21 a month ago, now appears to be in
an upswing. Even if the next couple of quarters show subpar results, Nokia
figures to be back among the market's brightest stars within 12 months.

I wanted to take a minute to thank all of you for your encouragement and 
donations for my MS150 bike tour this last weekend.  It was so much fun!  
There is no doubt that you're money will be of great help as I stock up with 
pain killers...just kidding.  I will be coming around this week to collect 
the money so that I can send it as soon as possible to those people diagnosed 
with MS.  

If you're writing a check please make it payable to "National Multicple 
Sclerosis Society."

Once again, thanks for all of your support!

Alejandra

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Fix your mix

In volatile markets like this one, sectors behave in radically different
ways. Here's what you need to know to find today's best opportunities.

By Michael Sivy

When the economy is purring along, most stock groups rise and fall
together. But amid uncertainty and turmoil, different groups suffer at
different times and rebound with varying delays. That's what's been
happening this year, and investors preparing for 2001 need to examine each
sector independently to find the best bargains and to minimize risk.

Since January, there have been three big divergences in the market. The
first has been between tech stocks and defensive groups. The second has
been between issues with high P/Es and those with low P/Es. And the third
has been between companies with big market capitalizations and those with
small caps.

After many months of leadership, tech stocks peaked in March and have
declined as evidence of an economic slowdown accumulated. Technology
companies began warning that their earnings might fall short in upcoming
quarters, and the entire sector suffered as money managers and individual
investors began reducing their exposure. By Thanksgiving, even the
strongest and most popular tech stocks, including Cisco and Oracle, were
down a third or more from their highs. And even at current levels the
stocks aren't cheap with P/Es as high as 50. They'll be vulnerable to
further declines until it's clear that the economy has completed its 
downswing.

By contrast, consumer stocks (which are defensive because they aren't as
tied to economic cycles as tech stocks are) benefited from investors'
flight to safety. After having dropped by a third to less than $60 a share
in March, Procter & Gamble [PG] rebounded 35 percent to $74. And
Anheuser-Bush [BUD] has rallied more than 70 percent over the same period
to $48. Those stocks are now trading at more than 20 times next year's
earnings, so they're no longer exceptionally cheap. But such defensive
issues may still be worth buying to balance a portfolio that has been
overloaded in tech.

Energy stocks have also benefited immensely as a defensive sector, but they
were helped even more by this year's sharp runup in the price of oil.
ExxonMobil [XOM], one of the most conservative international oil companies,
has gained 20 percent since March to $89 a share. I doubt, however, that
oil can remain above $30 a barrel for more than a year or two -- today's
high prices will bring on more supply and an economic slowdown could reduce
demand. As a result, I think energy stocks may have seen the best parts of
their gains.

While constrained supply has pushed up prices in the oil business,
oversupply has done the opposite in telecommunications. Fiercely
competitive phone companies have overbuilt their networks so much that they
have been undercutting each other on pricing and cutting back on further
equipment purchases. The result is that stocks throughout the sector --
from service providers like AT&T [T] and WorldCom [WCOM] to equipment
manufacturers like Lucent [LU] -- have lost more than half their value
since the spring. Statistically, I think stocks in the group are
undervalued by a third, but they still may represent dead money for the
next six months.

These divergences among industry sectors are the most visible symptom of
the roiling market, but they aren't the only one. The largest U.S.
companies have average P/Es in the mid-20s, and the most popular giants
have P/Es double or nearly triple historical levels. By contrast, small
companies -- those with market caps of less than $3.5 billion -- have
average P/Es of below 18.

 From all these cross-currents, two important ideas emerge. At any point
there's likely to be at least one sector that's deeply undervalued. Don't
try to predict the turns -- just buy one or two of the blue chips in the
sector that looks cheapest. Right now, defensive stocks are still in an
uptrend but they're no longer cheap, while the techs are still falling
(their decline isn't over yet). You can either buy good tech values and
ride out any further decline or wait until they look fully washed out. The
other important idea is that high-P/E blue-chip growth stocks are way
overvalued compared with everything else. Of course, those are the stocks
everyone most wants to own. But be smart -- diversify with a value fund or
a fund that holds mid- and small-caps with an average P/E below 20. They're
out there.

Calpine-EMI wants to get a bid from us on a spread option on their Tiverton 
plant in Tiverton, Rhode Island for Sept 1, 00 through Dec 31, 00.  (Tiverton 
apparently has achieved full commercial status as of today)  I will be 
pulling together a price today/tomorrow and was hoping to get back to them no 
later than end of this week.  They are shopping this around to 4-5 entities 
including us.  Here are some details FYI:

Day-ahead on-peak call on either power or gas
Power qty = 250 MW
Power strike = $45/Mwh
Gas qty = 30,666 mmBtu per day (16 on-peak hours), which results in an 
implied heat rate of about 7667 mmbtu/GWh
Gas strike is $5.90/mmBtu
Gas is delivered to plant; they will assign their Algonquin gas capacity 
rights which will allow secondary rights anywhere on the Algonquin G lateral
Power firmness:  unit contingent with availability guarantee of not less than 
95%
Gas firmness:  secondary firm

Please get back to me ASAP with any comments or questions, including any 
feedback on the degree of "strategic fit" this position would provide us.  
Ed, I could especially use some gas expertise in scrubbing down the gas piece 
and to make sure our gas curves are in the market (some miscellaneous 
customer feedback I've gotten suggests our Northeast gas numbers are a bit 
off).  Thanks all

John

Bad news bulls
The news may be rotten for semiconductor stocks, but investors are betting
on a rebound for leaders like Intel.

By Michael Sivy

Over the past few months, I've been warning readers that the technology
sector remains in a broad downtrend that could last well into next year.
Nonetheless, when tech stocks have been beaten down badly enough, shares of
the strongest companies can rebound even in the face of continuing bad
news, provided their long-term prospects are good enough.

Exactly that sort of bad-news rebound has occurred for Applied Materials,
the leading maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Last week I
wrote that the battered stock would remain volatile and could face a
further decline of 10 percent to 15 percent. But I concluded that the
shares were so cheap at $38.50 that the upside was 10 times as great as the
downside. That proved true a lot faster than I expected. In the five
trading days since that column ran, the stock has jumped 32 percent to
nearly $51 a share.

Admittedly, my good timing was largely luck, but the power of Applied
Materials' comeback is a signal that other leading semiconductor stocks
also may have fallen too far. As a rule, if you're considering stocks in
the midst of bad news, it's smartest to stick with industry giants that
have bullet-proof balance sheets. You can be confident that they'll ride
out whatever bad conditions lie ahead, and they may even benefit as smaller
competitors are forced to give up market share.

On that basis, I'd certainly be inclined to look at Intel. Though it's the
world's leading chipmaker, with $34 billion in annual sales, Intel has
spent the year fouling up. Among the more spectacular errors, the company
ran short of capacity because it underestimated demand last year and cut
back capital spending. In addition, glitches were discovered last summer in
Intel's turbocharged Pentium III, and many of the chips had to be recalled.

Frankly, none of those failures will have much long-term impact. Intel
remains the industry's 800-pound gorilla and long-term earnings growth is
projected at more than 20 percent a year. Most analysts see continuing
weakness in the chip market for the next six months, but see the cycle
swinging up by late next year.

In September, Intel warned that third-quarter earnings would be lousy, and
the stock fell by $13 to $48 a share. At the time, I wrote that the stock
was down to buyable levels but that it wouldn't rebound right away. Over
the next three months, Intel sank to less than $32 amid a general selloff
in technology. But after announcing on Friday that fourth-quarter results
would be disappointing because of soft personal-computer sales, Intel
rallied. On Monday, investors followed through by bidding the stock up
another $3.50 to $37.50.

Investors are clearly betting that the worst is over. And with the stock
only about 20 percent above its lows (and 50 percent off its highs), I
think it makes sense to get on board. After revising their 2001 estimates
downward, analysts expect Intel to earn about $1.50 a share next year. At
the current share price, that's a 25 P/E -- cheap for a 20 percent core
growth rate. If Intel is missing from your portfolio, this may well be your
best opportunity for years to come.

Notice # 01-168
May 17, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 16, 2001
===========================================================
Previously, in Notice to Members #01-154, the Exchange stated that new
NYMEX Rule 9.11A
("Give-Up Trades") would go into effect on June 1, 2001.  The Exchange is
revising the implementation timeframe in order to provide Floor Members and
Member Firms with additional time to obtain necessary records and become
compliant with the requirements.  Accordingly, please be advised that this
rule now will go into effect beginning on the trade date of August 1, 2001.
Further, it is anticipated that a similar rule will be implemented for the
COMEX Division following final review and approval by the COMEX Governors
Committee.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We plan to upgrade the two NT servers that run Gas TDS's middle-tier 
applications this weekend.  Therefore, TDS will not be available between 
12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 10th, 2000.  If this downtime is 
in conflict with your schedule, please let me know ASAP.

I would also like to point out to you that when TDS is brought back on line, 
it will be necessary for all the desks to be reloaded.  Since we introduced 
the TDS Flag last month, this should not effect any of the desks.

Thank you for your cooperations,
Kenny H.

Subject: Columbia Homestead Expansion  

Columbia is taking expressions of interest in a project they are calling the 
Homestead expansion for firm (or possibly off-peak or seasonal firm) 
transportation into Operating Areas 1 and 10.  The open season will end on 
1/19/01.  The project could include Columbia working with another pipeline in 
the region, such as Transco to deliver more volumes using Transco's South 
Virginia lateral or CNG to deliver more volumes on the PL-1 line.  The 
project could include expanding Columbia's own line into Market Areas 33 and 
34 through looping or added compression.  Columbia is also considering 
building a line away from Loudoun, where LNG volumes will be delivered from 
the Cove Point pipeline, to power projects in Loudoun or Fauquier Counties in 
Virginia.  Columbia has also considered an idea in the past to build a line 
from the Cove Point terminal to BG&E through Calvert and Anne Arundel 
Counties.  Columbia indicated that they have talked with Bill Fox of 
VNG/ALG.  Columbia would like to talk with us concerning VNG, Hopewell or any 
other needs that we might have.

How now, Mad Cow

A slowing economy, unfavorable exchange rates and new fears about Mad Cow
disease are all taking a toll on McDonald's. What better reason for a
contrarian to buy.

By Michael Sivy

For a decade, McDonald's stock set a record high every single year. Then in
1999, the stock peaked just short of $50 a share -- and it's been downhill
ever since. McDonald's hit a low of less than $27 in September, and the
share price has recovered by only $4 since then. The global hamburger chain
still appears to face a spate of problems, but many contrarian-minded
analysts see a great buying opportunity.

With 28,000 outlets in 120 countries, McDonald's gets about half its sales
and operating profits outside of North America. Overall earnings were able
to expand at an 11.5 percent compound annual rate through most of the 1990s
because double-digit growth internationally gave a huge boost to
single-digit gains in the United States. But the global growth engine began
to falter with the Asian financial crisis in 1998.

Since then, overseas results have been penalized by unfavorable exchange
rates, particularly the weak euro, which erodes the value of profits earned
in much of Europe. This year, for instance, foreign exchange losses could
clip nearly 5 percent from McDonald's net income. Recently, however, an
even bigger problem has emerged in Europe: the resurgence of Mad Cow disease.

Various forms of brain disease have long occurred spontaneously in both
animals and humans. But adding the remnants of slaughtered animals to
cattle feed -- a practice that used to be widespread in the U.K. -- appears
to have spread some form of the disease more widely in that country.
Recently, however, infected cows have also been identified on the
Continent, leading to fears about the safety of European beef. Analysts
believe that could lead to a temporary drop in the consumption of
McDonald's hamburgers. Indeed, the company's European sales were off 11
percent in November.

It's scary, but it's also hard to believe that there will be any
significant damage to McDonald's long-term results. The use of animal
remains in feed is heavily restricted today, and there is little evidence
that the practices that promoted Mad Cow were ever significant outside of
the U.K.

Moreover, because of quality concerns, McDonald's has always been highly
selective about its suppliers. So the beef it buys is likely to conform to
the highest local safety standards. And to the extent that sales of beef
are hurt in continental Europe, McDonald's can promote alternative
products, as it already does in countries where local customs discourage
beef consumption.

Once the Mad Cow scare dies down, currency exchange trends should also help
the stock. After declining in value for nearly two years, the euro could
rebound by 10 percent or more over the next 12 months, according to
forecasters. McDonald's will open some 1,800 new outlets this year -- 200
in the U.S. and the rest in foreign markets. And store growth in 2001 is
projected to be roughly the same. Over the next five years, earnings per
share could rise nearly 12 percent annually.

The stock, which is both a growth favorite and a popular defensive choice
(suitable now that tech is in trouble), has traded at P/Es in the mid-20s
over the past few years. At a current $31, though, shares go for less than
20 times next year's estimated earnings of at least $1.60 a share. Based on
expected earnings growth and a modest P/E increase as recent bad news
abates, analysts see the stock reaching $42 or more before the end of 2001.

Dear PETER,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 3 of the markets
you are watching.  When you review the airfares below, remember that
fares change rapidly!  Low fares sell out quickly, and the sooner you
check, the more likely you are to find available seats.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

To find one of the fares below, point your web browser to your
Personal Fare Watcher Page on Travelocity by clicking on the
following URL link.  You can also copy and paste the URL into your
browser.

The gas group would like to roll out some new products and new locations for 
existing products in the next few weeks. 
The new products are Gas Daily and Physical index trades. I know that the Gas 
Daily products currently exist but the long and short descriptions need some 
work. 
I should have a list of new locations shortly.

Please let me know who I need to work with to make each of these things 
happen.  

Thanks,

Pete

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

Effective November 21, 2000, there will be a new procedure for lunch.  EOL 
traders and deskheads will eat first.  Then, your assistant will notify you 
when the rest of the traders can eat.   This new procedure is to ensure the 
EOL traders will not be away from their desk a long period time during 
lunch.   

Thank you for your cooperation.

Did you know that you can use merckmedco.com to order your prescriptions
online? Ordering online lets you take advantage of many benefits you don't
get when you refill through the mail, over the phone or even at your local
drugstore:

* Convenient add-to-cart features that let you order all your eligible
  prescriptions at the same time -- and our easy checkout makes payment a
  breeze!

* Easy access to up to 12 months of prescription history, so you and your
  health care professional will always know what medicines you've been taking.

* Brand-name and generic medication price comparisons that can save you money.

* A handy summary of recent prescription costs you can print for tax purposes
  or for flexible spending account reimbursement.

To start enjoying these services, all you need to do is update your
merckmedco.com online profile with a recent prescription number. Here's a
step-by-step guide (you may want to print this page now so you can refer to
the directions):

* Follow this link:
  https://host1.merck-medco.com/cgi-bin/Rb_home.cgi?-Q-OTC2000M23
  and log in with your merckmedco.com user ID and password.
* Click on "My Profile" just above the bottom blue menu bar. You will be
  presented with a list of update options.
* Select "Update personal and member information" from the list of update
  options.
* Scroll down to the "Prescription Information" section and enter a
  prescription number from a recent prescription. You can usually find a
  prescription number on the label of the package that contains your medicine.
  For more information on where to find your prescription number, use the
  online help feature located to the left of the "Prescription Information"
  section.
* Click on the "Submit" button at the lower right to be certain that we
  receive your update.

For AOL Users:
<a 
href="https://host1.merck-medco.com/cgi-bin/Rb_home.cgi?-Q-OTC2000M23">Merck-M
edco Homepage</a>

Once you update your profile, you will be able to view up to 12 months of
prescription history and refill and request renewals for mail service
prescriptions by clicking on the "My Prescriptions" tab located at the top
of the page each time you log in.

Take advantage of all the useful features in merckmedco.com's

Unfortunately, during this holiday season a record number of travelers

offering spectacular holiday savings through the end of this year as low

cities below you should check out the economy and convenience of SunPark:
 Buffalo  Columbus  Houston
 Los Angeles  Memphis  Oklahoma City
 Philadelphia St. Louis  Washington, DC

Don=01,t be caught in the crowds this holiday season. Park your car at a
SunPark parking lot and enjoy savings and services not found at other
airport parking lots. For more information visit our feature story at

To all:

Kathy and I would like to extend our warmest thanks for the stroller/carseat 
(infant SUV) everyone gave us on Tuesday. Kathy was dissapointed she could 
not be here, as she has been ordered bedrest by the OBGyn nazi. She looks 
forward to meeting all of you soon. Again, we really appreciate the gift and 
will use it everyday. 

Thank you,

Craig

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

Dear PETER,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 3 of the markets
you are watching.  When you review the airfares below, remember that
fares change rapidly!  Low fares sell out quickly, and the sooner you
check, the more likely you are to find available seats.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

To find one of the fares below, point your web browser to your
Personal Fare Watcher Page on Travelocity by clicking on the
following URL link.  You can also copy and paste the URL into your
browser.

**************************** November 28, 2000  ************************

If you were one of the millions who dealt with the crowds during
Thanksgiving travel, you may be ready for another vacation. If that's the
case, you don't want to miss out on our $158 roundtrip coast-to-coast
super sale (travel through March 1) or our 50 percent off Caribbean sale
(travel through June 15, including the peak winter season). With cold
weather settling in across many parts of the country, 85-degree beaches
and a tall tropical drink sipped under a warming sun sounds pretty good.
If sunshine and beaches are not your cup of Long Island Tea, pick the spot
that hits your fancy and fly between over 58 U.S. cities coast-to-coast
for only $158-198 through March 28 (Florida travel is valid through March
14). As an added plus, check an offer that can make you an elite-level
frequent flyer with just one trip. Most frequent flyers have to rack up a
minimum of 25,000 airmiles to hit the first level of elite status, but we
can tell you how to do it quick and easy. We're posting many other goodies
on our News Desk by the hour. Add it to your bookmarks and visit regularly
to be among the first to know what's up in low fares.

COAST-TO-COAST FROM $158 THROUGH MARCH 1, 2001
Just in time for the holidays, we have coast-to-coast airfares as low as
$158 roundtrip. Chances are, we have the route you need. Please be aware
that travel to Florida will be almost impossible December 18-29 for those
who have not already purchased. Even First Class is almost completely sold
out. That leaves the rest of the country at your disposal on Bestfares.com
bargain fares, or you can book Florida for a welcome post-holiday stay.
We'll even waive that ferocious $40 fuel surcharge to add to your savings.
For example, travel to and from the West Coast--Los Angeles, San
Francisco, San Diego, Salt Lake City, Seattle or Portland--to Baltimore,
Hartford, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Houston and many more
cities for just $158 roundtrip. From the West Coast to Dallas, Minneapolis
or Milwaukee is just $190. From the West Coast to Boston, New York City,
Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Miami is only $238. Don't miss out on
these holiday and winter fares. Go home for the holidays (or relax
afterward) on these tempting fares. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.

LAST 4 DAYS: $198 RT BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES THROUGH MARCH 31
If we don't have the coast-to-coast sale fare you need in one category,
we'll try another. This one requires fast action, with just four days left
to book, but it gives you an extra month of travel (March 1-31) plus
another bucket of fares to draw from. Business travelers face walk-up fare
increases of as much as $370, added since the first of the year. Leisure
travelers can use this sale to fly for slightly more than half of what
business travelers are paying in fare hikes alone. If you live in Seattle,
Portland (OR), Reno, Las Vegas, San Francisco, San Diego, Phoenix or Los
Angeles, head east to Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach (the home
of the challenging chad), Baltimore, Detroit, New Orleans, Houston or
Chicago. There are many additional choices. Availability for December
travel is as tight as the smile on a Supreme Court Justice's face, but we
should be able to get you what you need for the remaining months. Don't
miss out on a sale that can save you hundreds of dollars. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898 and scroll to the applicabl=
e
headlines.

RT TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 THROUGH JUNE 15, 2001
They said it couldn't be done, but that's the kind of challenge we rise to
meet. The result--$328 roundtrip airfares from 40 U.S. cities to your
choice of 15 cities in the Caribbean for the 2001 peak winter travel
season. These fares can be 50 percent (or more) off standard published
fares. Think warm fun and island breezes in Cancun, St. Maarten, Aruba,
San Juan, St. Croix, St. Thomas, Montego Bay, Grand Cayman, Nassau and
four other Bahamas Islands. Golfers, how about Bermuda's extraordinary
courses? These fares are valid from over 40 U.S. cities starting at $328
roundtrip. Departure cities include New York City, Atlanta, Boston,
Buffalo, Philadelphia and Washington (DC). Our most expensive ticket
(still cheap) is from the West Coast, and it's only $458 roundtrip,
including Denver, Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, San
Francisco and Seattle. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10088489.

RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THROUGH AUGUST 31
If you live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to
Minnesota, in Atlanta, or in almost any major city to the east, fly to
dozens of destinations for $198-218 roundtrip. This deal includes New York
City, Boston, Myrtle Beach, many more southeast, southern and Texas cities
and over 50 cities in the Midwest. You can save up to 65 percent and lock
in sale fare travel through August 15, 2001. If you know where you'll be
heading for summer vacation, book now and cross one big planning problem
off your list. These fares also cover New Year's, Spring Break, Easter,
Memorial Day weekend and the Fourth of July. If you've checked out the
fares offered to the general public during these travel periods, you'll
realize what bargains we've negotiated. For details, visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10089324.

ELITE STATUS ON TWA AFTER ONLY ONE TRIP
If you've been considering discretionary leisure travel in December, this
deal could give you the inspiration to confirm. If you have to travel in
December, this deal gives you a bonus that lasts long after you land. Fly
just one roundtrip by December 31, 2000 and we will jump your TWA Aviators
frequent flyer status to elite level--a level that usually requires 25,000
airmiles in one year. If you like free, space-available upgrades to First
Class and bonus miles on all your future trips, you're going to like this
benefit. we'll even show you how to do it on reduced fares. For full
details, visit http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10108936.

The 2000 Chairman's Award nomination process was a tremendous success!  Fro=

places to work.  The eleven individuals named below are flying to San Anton=

Conference.  One of these finalist will receive the distinguished recogniti=

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

Hey Peter, Could you pass this on to the proper person. For the past week or
so, we've been getting some very low prices from Enron in the San Juan
Basin. The non-Bondad and Bondad price have been the same, and non-Bondad
been very much below the rest of the market especially considering the
volume reported. Today, I understand you posted a 4.145 for your online
trading average. You reported 4.07 for 600,000 to us. What gives? Thanks. T

I just  spoke to Jeff and he is interested in talking to you.  He saw your 
name on some kind of list for "redeployment" and asked if I knew you.   The 
job is in his fundamental analysis group.  He wants you to send your resume

**************************** December 4, 2000  ************************

If your travel plans include coast-to-coast travel between now and March
1, we strongly suggest that you review our $158-238 roundtrip
Coast-to-Coast Super Sale Fares. These fares have just been discounted and
can take you between two groups of cities, each group encompassing a wide
geographic area. The first group includes Los Angeles, San Diego, Ontario,
Phoenix, Orange County, San Francisco, Las Vegas, San Jose, Sacramento,
Reno, Portland (OR), Seattle, Denver, Colorado Springs and many more. The
second group includes a wide assortment of Midwest and East Coast cities,
including Boston, Hartford, New York City, Washington (DC), Atlanta,
Orlando, Tampa, Fort Lauderdale, New Orleans, Chicago, Houston and Dallas.
If you want to travel between Washington (DC) and San Diego for example,
the lowest published 21-day advance fare is a whopping $742 roundtrip plus
a $40 fuel surcharge, bringing the final cost up to $782. Our lowest
14-day advance purchase fare is $238 with no $40 fuel surcharge added. You
can purchase your ticket and as many as three companion tickets at
super-low fares if you purchase by December 5. In our sample fare
scenario, you can even use alternate airport strategy and depart from
Baltimore instead of Washington, to lower your fare to $158 roundtrip. Our
travel agents stand ready to help you with alternate airport
recommendations. Be sure to note the December 5 deadline for Super Sale
Coast-to-Coast savings. Visit
 http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898.

FINAL 2 DAYS: FLY TO 7 MEXICAN CITIES AND SAVE UP TO 70%
It's chili today in most of the U.S. and hot tamale in Mexico. You can
save up to 70 percent on airfares to several destinations in sun-drenched
Mexico for travel this winter. These sale fares for Christmas and New
Year's have sold out, but there's plenty left for travel between January 8
and March 1. We have great airfares to Mexico City, Guadalajara, Acapulco,
Ixtapa, Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta and the hottest of the current beach hot
spots--Los Cabos. How about San Diego to Los Cabos for $178 roundtrip
(kids $99) or Boston, New York City, Washington (DC) or Atlanta to Mexico
City for $238 (kids $149)? Fly from Denver, San Francisco, Portland (OR)
or Seattle to Puerto Vallarta or Los Cabos for $218 roundtrip (kids $109);
Dallas, Chicago, St. Louis or Kansas City for $258 (kids $129). Treat
yourself to a wonderful beginning to 2001 with cheap Bestfares.com tickets
to Mexico. Getting through the hustle and bustle of the holidays is apt to
be a lot easier if you can look forward to a winter vacation on the beach.
 This deal also requires fast action, with less than 36 hours left to
purchase. Tickets will only be available until 6:00 p.m. (CST) December 5.
We may not see fares to Mexico this inexpensive during 2001. Act fast and
let Bestfares.com save you mucho pesos on a trip to a country with so much
to offer. Visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10074381.

RT BETWEEN 50 CENTRAL AND EAST COAST CITIES $198-218 THRU AUGUST 31
If you want to travel after the March travel deadline for our $158 fares
and live in an expanded Central U.S. area that stretches from Texas to
Minnesota, in Atlanta or in almost any major city to the east, you can fly
to dozens of destinations for $198-218 roundtrip. This deal includes New
York City, Boston, Myrtle Beach, many more Southeast, Southern and Texas
cities and over 50 cities in the Midwest. You can save up to 65 percent
and lock in sale fare travel through August 15, 2001. If you know where
you'll be heading for summer vacation, book now and get one big planning
task off your list. These fares also cover New Year's, Spring Break,
Easter, Memorial Day weekend and the Fourth of July. If you've checked out
fares offered to the general public during these travel periods, you'll
realize what bargains we've negotiated. For details, visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10089324.

DOUBLE WHAMMY: SAVE UP TO 65% ON HOTELS ACROSS THE U.S.A.
With coast-to-coast airfares as low as $158 roundtrip and hotel rates
discounted by up to 65 percent, an inexpensive getaway is yours for the
booking. Hotel Reservations Network (HRN) has accommodations in Las Vegas
at Treasure Island from only $65.95. Stay in New York City at the Crown
Plaza from only $149.95; the Four Points Sheraton Hotel in Orlando and the
Ramada Plaza in downtown San Francisco from only $99.95. Enjoy New
Orleans' year-round party atmosphere before Mardi Gras madness (and sky
high priced) hit with rates at the Mansion Dupuy in New Orleans from
$79.95. Due to the limited number of rooms available at these rates, act
fast to increase your chance of getting exactly what you want. HRN can
also help out during holiday periods when desirable hotels are "sold out"
in New York, Las Vegas and other popular holiday destinations. It's great
to have a friend in the business and, with HRN, you do! Book now while
these rooms--sold out to the public-- are available to you with just a
click of the mouse.

FREE COMPANION OFFER FROM AMERICAN AIRLINES
We like to celebrate every day with travel bargains. Since today is
officially National Brown Shoes Day, how about a deal that will keep you
"well-heeled?" If American Airlines is one of your favorites, you'll love
this deal. If you like the idea of a free companion ticket, we can help
you accomplish that feat. A new credit card offer from CitiBank allows you
to receive American AAdvantage miles with each purchase. Plus, if you are
approved for the card, you will receive a bonus American Airlines
companion certificate that covers anywhere they fly in the 48 contiguous
states and Alaska. Purchase a ticket priced at a minimum of $358 and take
along a companion for free. Travel is valid throughout 2001, with some
blackout dates. For the (very) significant details visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10108938.

SAVE UP TO $800 RT TO AUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND THROUGH MARCH 24
With summertime hitting the South Pacific, how about airfares at up to
$800 off standard summer rates? This is a great time to think about flying
Down Under.
Fares from Los Angeles or San Francisco to Sydney, Auckland, Brisbane or
Melbourne are now only $899 roundtrip (kids $749). The regular summer
season fares are between $1,638 and $1,708 roundtrip. Our $899 fare is
valid seven days a week with no weekend surcharge. You save up to $849 per
ticket. New York City to Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane is only $1,179
roundtrip instead of the $2,314 usually charged for peak-season weekend
travel. You save almost $1,000 roundtrip. This sale is valid for departure
from most U.S. cities.  To take advantage of our Down Under fares, visit
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10110258.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

What We're Reading
[IMAGE] Pearl Harbor: The Day of Infamy - An Illustrated History
by Dan Van Der Vat
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declared December 7, 1941 as "A day 
that will live in infamy," the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, 
pulling the U.S. into World War II. This visually stunning book, by noted 
historian Dan van der Vat, features groundbreaking research, over 250 images, 
including previously unpublished personal photos from the perspective of both 
Americans on the ground and Japanese in the air, as well as a 
moment-by-moment breakdown of the attack. There are also numerous personal 
accounts, memorabilia, and illustrations by Tom Freeman. A major achievement. 


  Our Price: $31.96  You Save: $7.99  (20%) ??? [IMAGE] An Album of Memories: 
Personal Histories from the Greatest Generation
by Tom Brokaw
 As he's done in his immensely popular Greatest Generation volumes, Tom 
Brokaw again celebrates the trials and triumphs of the Americans who 
experienced the Depression and World War II. Album of Memories is a 
collection of letters written to Brokaw by those who lived during this 
period, and in some cases, their children. Complete with photographs and 
memorabilia, the overall emotional impact of these letters is intense. To 
read them is both a moving experience and an opportunity to experience 
history at its most intimate. 


  Our Price: $23.96  You Save: $5.99  (20%) ??? [IMAGE] Disaster! The Great 
San Francisco Earthquake and Fire of 1906
by Dan Kurzman
 Just after 5 a.m. on April 18, 1906, an earthquake measuring 8.3 on the 
Richter scale ripped through sleeping San Francisco, toppling buildings, 
exploding gas mains, and trapping thousands of citizens beneath tons of 
stone, broken wood, and twisted metal. Drawing on meticulously researched and 
eye-witness accounts, Dan Kurzman re-creates one of the most horrific events 
of the 20th century. More riveting than fiction but incredibly true, 
Disaster! is unforgettable history--a masterful account of the calamitous 
demise and astonishing resurrection of an American city. --From the publisher

History Bestsellers
[IMAGE] Time Lord : Sir Sanford Fleming and the Creation of Standard Time
by Clark Blaise
 The remarkable story of Sandford Fleming, the man who created and then 
convinced all the nations of the world to adopt a unified standard for 
telling time. Standard Time was one of the crowning achievements of Victorian 
progressiveness and one of the few Victorian innovations to have survived 
practically unchanged into our era. Few technological inventions have proven 
to be both as invisible and as important. In Time Lord, Clark Blaise 
introduces us to an almost-forgotten figure, who saw the world as a whole and 
overcame traditional and national objections to the rational accounting of 
time. --From the publisher


  Our Price: $19.20  You Save: $4.80  (20%) ??? [IMAGE] April 1865 : The 
Month That Saved America
by Jay Winik
 April 1865 is one of those rare, shining books that takes a new look at an 
old subject and changes the way we think about it. Jay Winik shows that there 
was nothing inevitable about the end of the Civil War, from the fall of 
Richmond to the surrender at Appomattox to the murder of Lincoln. Readers 
will come away with a new appreciation for that momentous month and a 
sharpened understanding of why and how the Civil War was fought. This is a 
magnificent work--surely the best book on the Civil War to be published in 
some time. 


  Our Price: $26.00  You Save: $6.50  (20%) ??? [IMAGE] Body of Secrets : 
Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency from the Cold War 
Through the Dawn of a New Century
by James Bamford
 A no-holds-barred examination of the National Security Agency packed with 
startling secrets about its past, newsbreaking revelations about its 
present-day activities, and chilling predictions about its future powers and 
reach. James Bamford first penetrated the wall of silence surrounding the NSA 
in 1982, with the much-talked-about bestseller, The Puzzle Palace. In Body of 
Secrets, he offers shocking new details about the inner workings of the 
agency, gathered through unique access to thousands of internal documents and 
interviews with current and former officials. --From the publisher

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Vail
Vail has been synonymous with skiing since the 1960s, and is still=20
rated the best ski area in the United States by many polls year after=20
year. With 4,000 acres of skiable (and boardable) terrain, 25 chair=20
lifts, and a wide range of terrain, it's no wonder this huge mountain
remains popular. And unlike some ski areas, the town of Vail is a=20
destination unto itself, with sophisticated shopping, dining, and=20
entertainment options to keep even complete non-skiers happy.=20

Sydney

dining and entertainment options that Taos (population: 5,000) has,=20
but few can boast of having a cultural scene quite like Taos. For=20
over 100 years, the town has attracted a growing number of artists,=20
drawn by the distinctive light, desert beauty, and supportive=20
community. Today, about 15 percent of the town's permanent residents=20
are artists. In addition, the rich cultural traditions of the area's=20
Mexican and Native American populations would make this a fascinating=20
vacation spot even if it weren't for the nearby Taos ski area--one of=20
the best in the Rockies.=20

Switzerland
For a winter getaway with a European flavor, Switzerland is the place=20
to be. The Swiss Alps are home to many ski/snowboarding areas, and a=20
wide range of resorts--you're never too far from the mountains in=20
tiny Switzerland. Towns such as Zermatt and St. Moritz are where=20
you'll find the classic upscale European ski-resort experience. Not=20
to worry; you'll also find more modest areas sprinkled among the=20
hyper-glamorous ones. The country's famous cuisine, shopping, orderly=20
cities, and picturesque mountain scenery are year-round treats, and=20
enough to keep anyone busy all vacation long.=20

Florida

eSource Launches eSearch Site Bringing Research to Your Desktop


eSource, Enron's premier research group, launched their new product, eSearch, 
on December 8, 2000. 

eSource's team of specialized researchers have created a web site to bring 
information and research to every employee's desktop.  The eSearch web site 
offers many links to information resources, access to research databases, 
specialized searches, sites to purchase books, articles, and reports, and 
training.  Employees can use the web site to conduct their own research or as 
a vehicle to submit research requests.  eSource's researchers and industry 
specialists are available to all Enron business units to provide timely and 
cost efficient research, to work with individuals or groups to fulfill one 
time research requests, or to design ongoing, customized monitoring projects 
or news updates.


The preferred browser is Internet Explorer

Join us for a demonstration and training session on Friday, December 15th at 
1:00-1:30 and 2:00-2:30 in room EB5C2.

other attractions (or distractions!) Las Vegas can offer. We've=20

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Vail
Vail has been synonymous with skiing since the 1960s, and is still=20
rated the best ski area in the United States by many polls year after=20
year. With 4,000 acres of skiable (and boardable) terrain, 25 chair=20
lifts, and a wide range of terrain, it's no wonder this huge mountain
remains popular. And unlike some ski areas, the town of Vail is a=20
destination unto itself, with sophisticated shopping, dining, and=20
entertainment options to keep even complete non-skiers happy.=20

Sydney
Want to escape winter for real? Then head down under, where summer is=20
getting going as the first chill gusts of winter blow through the=20
Northern Hemisphere. Sydney's an exciting place to visit any time.=20
And with Olympic tourists long gone, and the weather getting=20
beautiful, now's a great time to discover the opera house,=20
picturesque harbor, world-famous Bondi Beach, and more.=20

Taos
Located in the beautiful Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Taos is=20
different from many ski towns you may have visited. Many have the=20
dining and entertainment options that Taos (population: 5,000) has,=20
but few can boast of having a cultural scene quite like Taos. For=20
over 100 years, the town has attracted a growing number of artists,=20
drawn by the distinctive light, desert beauty, and supportive=20
community. Today, about 15 percent of the town's permanent residents=20
are artists. In addition, the rich cultural traditions of the area's=20
Mexican and Native American populations would make this a fascinating=20
vacation spot even if it weren't for the nearby Taos ski area--one of=20
the best in the Rockies.=20

Switzerland
For a winter getaway with a European flavor, Switzerland is the place=20
to be. The Swiss Alps are home to many ski/snowboarding areas, and a=20
wide range of resorts--you're never too far from the mountains in=20
tiny Switzerland. Towns such as Zermatt and St. Moritz are where=20
you'll find the classic upscale European ski-resort experience. Not=20
to worry; you'll also find more modest areas sprinkled among the=20
hyper-glamorous ones. The country's famous cuisine, shopping, orderly=20
cities, and picturesque mountain scenery are year-round treats, and=20
enough to keep anyone busy all vacation long.=20

Florida
Hate snow? Love sunshine? Think "winter wonderland" is an oxymoron?=20
Then visit Florida this winter. The sunshine state is warm and sunny=20
year-round--and surprisingly affordable, too. From the trendy good=20
times of Key West to the stately charms of historical Pensacola and=20
white-sandy Sarasota, Florida is the continental United States' own=20
tropical getaway.=20

=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =
=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes=
t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=
e=20
communicating to Enron=01,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vend=

about the new process. =20

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are=20

,s=20
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed=20

What is Managed Services?

consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =

received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com

=========================================

Nasdaq crash victim

Applied Materials has fallen to fire-sale prices.

By Michael Sivy

The Dow may be down only 10 percent from its 52-week high, but the Nasdaq
is in the middle of a screaming bear market, down nearly 50 percent from
its high in March. Computer stocks have been among the hardest hit,
particularly PC makers: Compaq is down 34 percent from its peak, Dell is
off 68 percent and Gateway, 76 percent.

The weakness extends down the food chain. Intel, which counts on PC makers
for a large slice of its semiconductor sales, has lost 56 percent. And
Applied Materials [AMAT], the leading producer of semiconductor equipment,
is off 66 percent.

I don't believe that the outlook for these stocks is nearly as bleak as
their recent performance suggests. It's true that the crucial
fourth-quarter season isn't looking very bright. And the most pessimistic
analysts argue that PCs are becoming like television sets -- commodities
distinguished only by price. Without the ability to charge premium prices
for added bells and whistles, the thinking goes, already-thin profit
margins will deteriorate even more. But over the next five years, sales for
top companies in the PC sector are projected to grow 12 percent to 15
percent annually, and earnings could rise 16 percent to 20 percent or more.

The next few months may be trying, but they should offer investors great
long-term buying opportunities. And the best one, to my mind, figures to be
Applied Materials, which is capable of growing profits an average of 25
percent a year.

The stock's big drawback is its extraordinary volatility. Even when it
looks cheap, it's capable of falling further if the technology sector is
doing poorly. And since two-thirds of sales come from overseas, Applied
Materials is fully exposed to the vagaries of international economics, from
the weak euro to Asian financial problems. In fact, I've recommended the
stock several times before at higher prices, only to watch it go even lower.

At this point, however, I don't see how it could fall much more. Analysts
have reduced earnings estimates for the current fiscal year (ending Oct. 1,
2001) from $3.50 a share two months ago to as little as $2.10 today. But
even based on these reduced estimates, at $38.50 a share the stock is
trading at less than 19 times earnings, or just 0.8 times its long-term
growth rate.

Business conditions may well be tough through the first half of 2001, and
some analysts see the stock going as low as $33 or $34 before bottoming.
But business conditions should improve by the second half. Given that the
stock could easily trade at more than double today's price in a more
favorable market, the potential upside looks 10 times greater than the
downside.

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

**************************** November 20, 2000  ************************

As sure as each hour brings a new court decision =01( as sure cranberry sal=
es
peak in November =01( Thanksgiving surprise fares appear. We=01,re sending =
out
this special edition e-mail to give you a jump on these new deals. Plus,
in (festive) light of our new, lower Turkey Day fares and the short
workweek, we decided to release our Hot Deals By E-mail today and on
Wednesday of the upcoming holiday week. This will help those who want to
travel home for the holidays and visit the relatives (or get away from
Uncle Ed=01,s snoring during the football game). You can take advantage of =
a
two-day getaway that takes you where you want to go on Thanksgiving
Thursday and brings you back home Friday for a restful weekend. Airfares
are as low as $64 roundtrip, and just $151 roundtrip for travel up to
1,500 miles from your departing airport. Our Wednesday e-mail will also
offer newly negotiated deals to 15 Caribbean cities, including Cancun,
Grand Cayman, Montego Bay and St. Maarten with discounts reaching 60
percent for travel through June 15, 2001. If you=01,re going to be travelin=
g
and unable to check your e-mail, why not ask a family member at your
destination to sign up for a free Hot Deals subscription, so you can check
the latest-breaking deals from their computers? Just tell them Tom Parsons
will be talking turkey on low-fare travel.

THANKSGIVING FARES $64 TO $189 RT THROUGHOUT 48 STATES.
With airfares as low as $64 roundtrip, Thanksgiving travel is within the
reach of almost everyone. If you=01,re having the traditional family dinner
at home, here=01,s your opportunity to bring in a few more family members o=
r
friends to make the day more memorable. Or, surprise your family with a
short (and sweet) visit. In some cases, you can deliver yourself for
little more than what an FTD holiday bouquet would cost. A quick trip can
also provide a chance for some great Friday shopping. Head to New York
City for Macy=01,s Thanksgiving Day Parade and check out the festive store
windows. Visit the gigantic Mall of America in Minneapolis, Rodeo Drive in
Beverly Hills or the Dallas Galleria. To qualify for these super low
fares, you must depart on Thanksgiving Day and be on a return flight no
later than midnight Friday, November 25. One other important plus with
this special is that we can waive the standard $40 roundtrip fuel
surcharge. How cheap are these two-day stay fares? How about Dallas/Fort
Worth to San Diego or Los Angeles for $135 roundtrip? You can fly from
Chicago to New York City, Philadelphia, Washington (DC) or Atlanta for
$103 roundtrip. Fly from San Francisco to Minneapolis, Oklahoma City or
San Antonio for $151 roundtrip. Denver to Dallas/Fort Worth, Kansas City
or Des Moines is $103 roundtrip. Washington (DC) to Cleveland, Detroit,
Pittsburgh or Charlotte is $99 roundtrip. Atlanta to Indianapolis,
Louisville, Dayton or Columbus (OH) is $79 roundtrip. Check out our

Supersize this stock!

For six months, McDonald's has been battered by nonstop bad news. Now the
outlook is improving and the stock appears poised for a strong rebound.

By Michael Sivy

Since last fall, McDonald's has been hit with one problem after another.
The weak U.S. economy has been bad enough. But since half the company's
sales and operating profits come from overseas, McDonald's has been
severely hurt by the weak euro and the renewed scares about mad-cow disease
and hoof-and-mouth disease, which have reduced European beef consumption.
Finally, though, the outlook appears to be improving. Earnings trends may
remain unfavorable through the summer, but by the fourth quarter, business
should be back on track. That should mean a big payoff for contrarians who
scoop up McDonald's [MCD] today at prices just a few dollars above the
stock's 52-week low.

I last recommended the stock in December at $31 a share. At that price, 35
percent below the record high set in 1999, McDonald's looked like a great
value play, and the stock rallied 12 percent going into January. But it
began slipping back as soon as it became evident that business would not
immediately turn around. In fact, earnings per share fell 12 percent in the
first quarter.

Basically, McDonald's has been beset by a string of problems that have been
compounded by poor management choices. The first is the economic slowdown
in the U.S., which has depressed growth in same-store sales. In addition,
the company has relied too much on promotions and other marketing gimmicks,
which haven't been working well in the tougher economy.

More serious, however, has been the falloff in profits from foreign sales,
particularly in Europe. To compensate for the decline in beef consumption
and the chronically weak euro, which has reduced the dollar-value of
profits earned in Europe, McDonald's has been increasing the pace of
new-store openings. But that has only undercut existing stores, and
profitability has suffered.

Fortunately, those problems are all transient. As the U.S. economy picks up
again, domestic results should improve -- particularly if McDonald's is
successful with innovations such as cafes that offer Italian-style coffee
at prices cheaper than Starbucks charges.

International results should improve as the company diversifies its menu to
offer a wider range of non-beef items. But the key to better European
results is a revival in beef consumption, and a rebound in the euro, which
is likely after coins and bills actually start circulating in January. And
already, there is evidence that the beef scare has peaked and that
consumers are starting to order more burgers.

There's no question that McDonald's stock is cheap. The shares trade at 17
times earnings, compared with multiples that have been regularly in the
mid-20s since 1996. True, the rebound has taken longer than I expected. But
I think that we'll see earnings growth pick up toward year-end, and then
continue at a 12 percent-plus compound rate over the next five years. In
addition, the P/E should rise once it's clear that prospects are improving.
That combination should make McDonald's an above-average holding for
patient conservative investors.

I could not agree more. If a bunch of old limosuine liberals can't get it
right, tell them to soothe themselves by looking at their bank accounts.

Also, how ironic is it that Ole William Daley, Gore's spokesman, is the son
of the former mayor of Chicago who stole the election for JFK.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
May 9, 2001

Aluminum shines

The economy should come back later this year, and classic cyclical stocks,
such as Alcoa, have already begun major upswings.

By Michael Sivy

Amid all the concern about technology stocks, many investors seem to have
forgotten that the traditional business cycle still exists. But while the
drop -- and the more recent recovery -- in tech has been the most dramatic
event in the stock market, companies in other sectors have felt the results
of the economic slowdown, too. In fact, many traditional cyclical companies
experienced a classic bear market that ended a few months ago -- and they
now appear to be in the first phase of a recovery that could last as long
as five years.

The biggest gains figure to be in industries that benefit both from
improving economic activity and from moderate increases in inflation. Chief
among these stocks are the producers of raw materials. Since the supply of
commodities can't change very quickly, prices are set largely by the level
of demand. As a result, an economic upturn can make commodities prices firm
up quite suddenly. Moreover, initial inflation pressures -- such as those
that have been reported in the past couple of months -- typically show up
in the prices of metals before they show up in manufactured goods and 
services.

Alcoa [AA] is a prime example of such a stock. The world's largest aluminum
producer, Alcoa's earnings hardly fell during the slowdown of the past nine
months. Growth is expected to revive and accelerate over the rest of 2001.
And next year, the company is projected to increase earnings more than 30
percent.

Alcoa's resilience has several sources. One has been aggressive cost
reduction. Alcoa has already trimmed annual costs by $1 billion and plans
to cut $1 billion more. In addition, the aluminum giant has been shedding
non-core assets, such as an alumina refinery in Australia and the Thiokol
propulsion business that it acquired through an acquisition. Over the next
couple of years, Alcoa should become a more focused and more profitable
company.

Despite all this good news, Alcoa's results have been held back by three
factors -- the general economic slowdown, the somewhat depressed aerospace
market and the West Coast electricity shortage, which has idled some
production capacity. All three, however, are about to improve. The economy
should be in a solid recovery by next year. The construction of commercial
aircraft should reach a peak in the next few years, thanks to new models
from both Airbus and Boeing. And power availability in the Pacific
Northwest will eventually recover as well.

The result will be an extraordinarily strong upswing in earnings that will
rival those of some tech stocks. Over the next five years, Alcoa's earnings
should increase faster than 15 percent annually. At $41.50, Alcoa is
trading at just about 20 times estimated earnings for the current year and
less than 16 times next year's projected results. That compares with an
average P/E of 18 over the past six years. For anyone looking to balance a
tech portfolio without sacrificing above-average growth, Alcoa is a perfect
choice.

\----------------------------------------------------------/

1. Main Course: In New York, It's Cheese-Cart Gridlock
======================================================

The cheese-centric restaurant Artisanal is only the latest,
and most over the top, example of New York's sudden mania
for anything aged and moldy.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09CHEE.html?0509wd

Critic's Notebook: Funky, Runny, Ripe? Waiter, Bring It On

No cheese is too obscure for Times critic William Grimes
(see his review of Le Cirque, below), who counts himself
among a swelling population of cheese snobs.

Paan: To Refresh a Palate, or a Sultan's Kiss

The experience of eating paan, a tantalizing mix of Indian
flavors and textures, is as seductive as a stolen kiss, as
relaxing as an after-dinner cigar.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09PAAN.html?0509wd


2. Recipe of the Week: Mexican-Flavored Chicken Thighs
======================================================

Chicken thighs have a huge advantage over lean breasts. They
are juicy and flavorful, and made even more so by Mark
Bittman's Mexican-inspired treatment, a quick liquid rub for
the thighs, which packs plenty of punch, even if you use
just a little cayenne.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09MINI.html?0509wd

Tagines: A Secret Kept Under a Terra Cotta Lid

If you can get your hands on a tagine, the Moroccan pot with
a hoop skirt of a lid, try one of these luscious dishes,
including one for striped bass and another for chicken with
olives and preserved lemons.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09TAGI.html?0509wd


3. Wine List: The Day California Shook the World
================================================

Frank J. Prial remembers the 1976 wine tasting in Paris that
American winemakers and cultural historians have come to
characterize as the defining moment in the evolution of fine
wine in this country.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09WINE.html?0509wd

Tastings: Protean South African Blend

Judging strictly by flavor and price, says Eric Asimov,
South African pinotages are among the best red wine values
out there.

Wine picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Washington State is becoming known for its red-hot reds --
from cabernets to merlots. Check these out:

1998 Gordon Brothers Cabernet Sauvignon
$22 - Juicy, jammy fruit, spice, chocolate and a meaty
component are well framed by firm tannins -- this is one for
the cellar.
Four stars

sult_end.html&collection=WineTodayReviewsEnd&Filter=result_end_filter.hts&Resu
ltTemplate=result_end.hts&querytext=&wineid=20239&SUBMIT.x=28&SUBMIT.y=9

1998 Seven Hills Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon
$28 - Ripe and concentrated yet supple. Interesting for its
spice components that back up rich, deep, dark, fruit
flavors of black cherry, blackberry and black currant.
Four stars

1999 Andrew Will Klipsun Merlot
$40 - For those who like wild and daring flavors in their
merlots.

4. Multimedia: Cooking With the Times -- The Mayo Clinic
========================================================

Learn classical French technique through recipes and video
instruction. This month's class: The Mayo Clinic. Despite
what you might think, homemade mayonnaise is a true sauce, a
culinary treasure.
http://www.nytimes.com/cooking?0509wd


5. NYC Restaurants: A Glittery Circus With Many Rings
=====================================================

Behold Le Cirque 2000, a giddy swirl of wealth and
privilege, of gilt without guilt, a glittering social
pageant that cries out for a Balzac or a Wharton. As pure
spectacle, there is nothing in New York like it. (Three
stars.)
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09REST.html?0509wd

>From simple recipes for a new mother to what wines might be
best for your health, readers share their insights and
answer fellow readers' questions.

Q. I have never been much of a cook, but things have been
pretty pitiful since my baby arrived 5 months ago. I have
very limited time for food preparation, and the stew-type
standbys aren't as appetizing as it gets warmer. I am going
for healthy, balanced meals that don't require too much
hands-on prep time. -- sozobe

Austin, TX (Dec. 4)--Attorneys for Texas Governor George W. Bush filed suit
in federal court today, seeking to prevent Santa Claus from making his list
and then checking it twice.  The complaint seeks an immediate injunction
against the beloved Christmas icon, asking the court to
effectively ban his  traditional practice of checking the list of good boys
and girls one  additional time before packing his sleigh.

The suit filed in Federal District Court in Austin, asks a federal judge to
"hereby order
Mr. Claus to cease and desist all repetitive and duplicative  list-checking
activity, and certify the original list as submitted without  amendment,
alteration, deletion, or other unnecessary modification.":   There are no
standards for deciding who is naughty, and who is nice.  It's  totally
arbitrary and capricious.  How many more time does he need to check?  This
checking, checking and re-checking over and over again must stop now,"  said
former Secretary James Baker

Baker further claimed that unnamed GOP observers witnessed an elf remove all
boys named Justin from the 'nice' list, filing them under 'naughty' instead
because "everyone knows all boys named Justin are brats."    Gov. Bush cited
the potential for unauthorized list tampering, blasted what  he called the
"crazy, crazy mess up there at the North Pole."    "Their security is really
awful, really bad," said Bush.  "My mother just  walked right in, told 'em
she was Mrs. Claus.  They didn't check her ID or  nothing."

Meanwhile, Dick Cheney, issued a direct plea to St. Nick himself.  "Mr.
Claus, I call on you to do the honorable thing, and quit checking your list.
The children of the world have had enough.  They demand closure now." Cheney
said, adding that his granddaughter has already selected a name for the pony
she's asked for.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson was quick to respond to the latest development with
plans to lead his protesters from Florida to the North Pole via dogsled. The
"Million Man Mush!" is scheduled to leave Friday.  "We need red suits and
sleighs, not law suits and delays," Jackson said.

Santa Claus could not be reached for comment, but spokeself said he was
"deeply distressed" by news of the pending legal action against him. "He's
losing weight, and he hasn't said 'Ho Ho Ho' for days," said the spokeself.
"He's just not feeling jolly."

Banks hitting bottom

Earnings disappointments and fears about bad loans have triggered a new
round of selloffs for financials like Bank of America and Chase Manhattan.
But it looks as though the worst is over.

By Michael Sivy

Bank of America's announcement on Wednesday afternoon that fourth-quarter
profits would fall substantially short of expectations sent major bank
stocks into a tailspin. B of A [BAC] closed the day down nearly 8 percent,
while Chase [CMB] dropped 3 percent. These declines are only the latest bad
news for the commercial banking sector, which has been battered all year.
In fact, both B of A and Chase are down by more than 20 percent since the
start of the year.

I can't say I anticipated the sell-off, since I bought Bank of America more
than 15 percent above its current price. Nonetheless, there's nothing
surprising about banks reporting bad numbers after a year of high interest
rates and six months of slowing economic growth.

Traders also got caught off guard by B of A's news. They were heavy buyers
of bank stocks Tuesday after Alan Greenspan addressed a conference of
bankers in New York City. The Federal Reserve chairman said "the pace of
economic activity has moderated appreciably." He added that the Fed now has
to be more attentive to the risk that the economy might slow too much. Many
economists read into those comments that the Fed will formally change its
stance in favor of lowering interest rates at its Dec. 19 meeting, and
actually cut them early next year.

Such news ought to be bullish for bank stocks. So why are they still
falling? Basically, they've virtually acknowledged that they'll report
sub-par earnings and higher loan losses this quarter and probably next.
Share prices could dip a bit more as those weak results get reported. But
most of that bad news is history -- from here on out, the trends will be
getting better, not worse.

Bank of America, which merged with NationsBank in 1998, is the largest U.S.
bank. Its stock is currently down to a paltry $38, just $2 above the
52-week low. For 2001, B of A should report earnings of about $5 a share,
just a single-digit gain from estimated 2000 results. Over the next five
years, however, analysts think the bank could grow earnings by about 10
percent annually. Including the 5 percent-plus dividend yield, that's quite
a generous return for shares that are trading at only eight times earnings.

Chase Manhattan presents a similar case. The bank, which is acquiring J.P.
Morgan, has been knocked down in anticipation of bad fourth-quarter
results. Chase is a major lender to troubled Xerox, for example, so that
could be a source of loan losses. Nonetheless, the banking giant offers 11
percent projected long-term earnings growth and a 3 percent dividend yield.
With a P/E of just over 10 times next year's estimated earnings, Chase
looks like a compelling buy as well.

the decks for a  four-day weekend. Bestfares.com will be posting new deals
throughout the holiday, but we=01,ll make this newsletter short and sweet,
whet your appetite with the best of our specials and leave you with room
for delicious desserts of deals. Our hot, new Caribbean sale can save you
up to 60 percent in the most popular travel season, and you still have

serve up our buffet of bargains.

50 U.S. CITIES TO 15 CARIBBEAN CITIES FROM $328 RT

with peak season fares beginning at only $328 roundtrip for travel through
June 15, 2001. We are having one knockout of a sale to 15 Caribbean cities
with airfares discounted by up to $500 for the high winter season, when
many travelers want to warm themselves under the tropical sun. We=01,ll war=

SUPER $198 RT SALE COAST-TO-COAST BETWEEN 58 U.S. CITIES
This past week, we watched business travelers get hit with their sixth
fare hike of the year. Some routes of over 1,500 miles have increased by
as much as $370 roundtrip since January 1, 2000. Fight back with our
leisure fares from select U.S. cities that let you fly coast to coast for
as little as $198 roundtrip through March 30, 2001 (travel to Florida
markets is valid through March 14). For example, fly from Seattle to
Orlando or San Diego to Baltimore. You have many options for travel
throughout the nation. Tickets must be purchased by December 1, 2000. Get
back some of the money the airlines have gotten for your business trips by
using our coast-to-coast $198 Super Sale fares. Access more information at
http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=3D10067898

THERE=01,S STILL TIME TO FLY ON TURKEY DAY FROM $59 RT
The trick to getting a great fare for those last minute home for the
holiday flights is to travel on Thursday and return on Friday. These
specials are valid for travel throughout both days, but availability is
best for travel later in the day on Thanksgiving, and return travel early
in the day on Friday. You can enjoy a late meal with your family, pack up
some leftovers and be home in time to rest up over the weekend. These
deals start at $59 (New York City to Boston, for example). You can travel
coast to coast from $151. Fares are based on one-way mileage: 250 miles
for $64 to $79 roundtrip; 251-500 miles for $79 to $99 roundtrip; 501-750
miles for $103 to $129 roundtrip; 751-1,000 miles for $119 to $149
roundtrip; 1,001-1,250 miles for $139 to $169 roundtrip; and over 1,250
miles for $151 to $189 roundtrip. Get the big end of the holiday dinner

Printing profits

Gannett is best known for publishing USA Today. But the company's local
papers and broadcasting properties make it the perfect play on a comeback
in advertising.

By Michael Sivy

It's too soon to say that the economic slump is over. But it's not too soon
to say that it will be over before long. Friday's surprising report on the
economy showed growth continuing at an annual rate of 2 percent, up from a
low of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000. And while the growth rate
could dip again, the Federal Reserve's most recent interest rate cut pretty
much ensures that the economy will be expanding solidly next year.

To play the potential rebound, most investors have focused on the tech
sector. I too think there are some good tech buys, but the outlook for many
technology issues is complicated by a host of factors, from overcapacity in
the telecommunications industry to the number of bad loans held by lenders.
The simpler way to bet on a potential rebound is with the shares of
consumer and basic manufacturing companies.

Chief among these businesses are those that depend on advertising. The
collapse of the free-spending dot-coms at the same time that the broad
economy was turning down created an advertising climate that has been
little short of disastrous. And even a moderate economic comeback could
provide a huge lift to those media companies that depend most on advertising.

Gannett [GCI], best known for publishing USA Today, is a perfect example.
Although the heavily formatted broadsheet has been derided as "McPaper,"
the journalistic equivalent of fast food, USA Today has a lot to be proud
of. At 2.3 million, it has the largest circulation of any U.S. daily. The
paper pioneered the use of colorful graphics and squeezes a lot of news in
a compact layout. I usually look at USA Today's business section first
every day, before I turn to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.

But Gannett's real upside lies in its other less-conspicuous properties.
The company runs nearly 100 local papers, which are often near-monopoly
outlets in midsize suburban markets. In addition, Gannett has 22 television
stations in 19 markets, scads of non-daily publications and websites, and
15 daily newspapers in the United Kingdom. Altogether, the company is
virtually an index fund for advertising spending.

In 2000, Gannett reported record earnings growth of 15 percent. In the
fourth quarter, the gain was only 11 percent because advertising trends had
already begun to weaken. That downtrend has continued, and for the first
quarter of 2001, profits were actually down 14 percent. The next few
quarters will be tough, but by 2002 earnings should be rising again -- and
media stocks typically discount trends in ad spending as much as a year in
advance. Gannett's stock hit bottom in September at $49 a share, and has
been rallying since then despite weakening earnings.

Longer term, the shares of this well-managed company look quite attractive.
Earnings figure to grow at a compound annual rate of about 13 percent over
the next five years. And at a current price of $64.55, the shares trade at
less than 18 times estimated earnings for the current year. That sounds
like a great format for capital gains.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com

Winning a loser's game

Companies that make the fewest mistakes will fare best in the current
market. And 3M is trying to not miss a trick.

By Michael Sivy

Some sports, such as football, are winner's games. The team with the most
successful offense wins. Others, such as golf, are loser's games. Players
don't defeat their opponents -- victory goes to the person who makes the
fewest mistakes. What kind of game is the stock market? That depends on
what type of market you're in.

Bull markets are basically winner's games. If you take as much risk as you
can stomach, chances are you'll be rewarded. The broad upward sweep of
share prices will make up for any minor errors in timing or stock
selection. But when you're in the midst of a bear market, realize that
you're playing a loser's game. Anything that goes wrong -- a slight
shortfall in earnings, for example -- will have a disproportionately
negative impact.

Right now, investment success hinges on not losing, and the smartest
strategy is to favor companies with a high degree of consistency and
predictability. Such companies typically have strong finances,
well-diversified product lines, a balance between domestic and
international sales and a long history of dividend increases. One stock
that fits that description is Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, or 3M
[MMM], which recently raised its dividend for the 43rd consecutive year.

At first glance, the results 3M reported on Monday look pretty good for a
near-recession economy. Earnings were up 3 cents a share on a 2.3 percent
gain in revenues. Analysts were cautionary, however, because the company's
U.S. revenues were down -- all the gains came from international sales,
which account for half the company's business. I don't have a problem with
that. Domestic sales are off because we're in the middle of an economic
slump. I see the fact that foreign business is supporting the company's
growth as a sign that 3M is well-diversified. The bigger issue, though, is
how the company will fare when the U.S. economy rebounds.

I recommended 3M last July at $88.50 a share as a stalled growth stock that
would get a higher valuation once growth picked up again. Since then, the
share price has risen more than 30 percent to $116.50. And I see further
gains ahead, as domestic sales improve over the next few quarters. For more
than a year, the company has been fine-tuning its product mix, which
includes more than 50,000 items ranging from electronics, medical devices,
and automotive parts to Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes.

That restructuring seems to be accelerating under new CEO W. James
McNerney, 51, formerly the CEO of GE's Aircraft Engine subsidiary. Analysts
applaud the speed with which McNerney has developed a comprehensive
cost-cutting plan since taking over on January 1. Along with first-quarter
earnings, 3M announced it would be shedding 5,000 jobs worldwide, or 7
percent of its workforce. In addition, 3M is planning to up its research
and development spending. The goal: deriving at least 20 percent of 2005
sales from products that don't even exist yet.

This year, earnings gains will likely be held to 5 percent or so, which
makes the stock look fully valued with a P/E of 24. But with a leaner cost
structure and an improving product pipeline, revenue and earnings growth
could accelerate starting in 2002. And that's the kind of outlook that
makes for winners, not losers.

FIVE-DAY SUPER SALE: $158 RT COAST-TO-COAST
On Tuesday of this week, our coast-to coast airfares for $158 roundtrip
expired. Due to overwhelming demand, we have been able to convince our
suppliers to renew these special fares from select U.S. cities. This new
contract was signed and sealed at 11:00 a.m., this morning.
This sale will now be available for travel through February 15, 2001 and
tickets must be purchased by December 11, 2000. These special fares will
not be available to/from Florida from December 18, 2000 through January 4,
2001, seats are completely sold out. The good news is that if you can fly
to Florida between January 5 and February 15, 2001, we have many airfares
ranging between $110 and $128 roundtrip. Airfares to/from California,
Arizona, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Utah and New Mexico to/from over 20
eastern U.S. cities range between $158 to $198 roundtrip.

We worked hard to extend this sale and our travel clubs will remain open
Thursday through Monday, including this weekend until 11:00 p.m. (CST).
Don't miss out on what could be the last super sale of 2000. For more
details, visit http://www.bestfares.com/view.asp?id=10067898.

Pete,

I'm seeing some trades with your name as Trader which are at extremely high 
prices.   Transco Z6 vs. Henry Hub trades at prices of $15.6025 from Trade 
Date of 12/5.  Are these errors?  EOL numbers are 658961 and 658985 (both 
with Reliant).  No confirmation has been sent on these.  Please have your 
Book Admin notify me as soon as you get a chance to look at these.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
May 2, 2001

A bounce for the brokers

Stocks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley were up at
least 5 percent on Wednesday -- and appear poised for even bigger gains.

By Michael Sivy

Most of the people I know are bearish on the shares of the company they
work for. Particularly when business conditions are as difficult as they
are right now, employees tend to focus on the short-term problems their
companies are facing and ignore the long-term fundamentals.

Perhaps that's the explanation for why analysts have recently been
downgrading brokerage stocks. They look around their offices and see
depressed profits and layoffs. Merrill Lynch's earnings fell 21 percent in
the first quarter, for instance, as commissions declined 30 percent,
trading revenue fell 15 percent and underwriting revenue dropped more than
6 percent. Things are so bad that Merrill Lynch and other major firms are
planning to slash their head counts -- by attrition in some cases and
outright layoffs in others.

But those short-term problems mask the fundamentals that long-term
investors should be paying attention to. At the most basic level,
brokerages are proxies for the stock market, so if you expect a resumption
of the bull market in the near future -- as I do -- you have to like the
sector.

And the fundamentals figure to keep improving. The economy should receive
an enormous boost over the next nine months from the Federal Reserve's
recent interest-rate cuts. And a large tax cut will encourage consumer
demand. Plus, concessions to Congressional Democrats that allow for higher
government spending will add further stimulus. Finally, potential Social
Security reform that permits some form of privatization would be a direct
benefit to financial-services firms.

The stock market has already recognized what the brokerages' own analysts
haven't. Stocks of the leading brokerages were up 5 percent on Wednesday,
and many have rallied at least 25 percent from their 52-week lows.

Still, these shares are hardly overvalued. Even after Wednesday's rally,
the stocks are anywhere from 15 to 35 percent below their highs of the past
seven months. Moreover, they still trade at less than 18 times estimated
earnings for the current year. That isn't much given their projected
long-term earnings growth of 13 percent or more.

Among the leaders in the group, Goldman Sachs [GS], with a 13 percent
growth rate, closed Wednesday at $98 a share for a 17 P/E; Merrill Lynch
[MER], 13 percent growth, traded at $67 for a 17.5 P/E; and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter [MWD}, 14 percent, closed at $66.50 for a 16 P/E.

Investors might also want to consider A.G. Edwards [AGE] as an undervalued
takeover play. The leading independent brokerage based outside of New York,
A.G. Edwards of St. Louis trades at $43 for a P/E of less than 14. The
trend toward financial services behemoths threatens to chip away at
Edwards' market share. But industry consolidation could also make Edwards a
takeover target, not only for major brokerages but also for the big banks.
Whether the stock is taken over or not, it's cheap based on fundamentals --
especially since it got up to nearly $58 a share when takeover rumors
heated up last summer.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
April 25, 2001

Construction project

The need for aggressive oil exploration and new electrical power plants
should be a bonanza for firms like Fluor that can manage such projects on a
global basis.

By Michael Sivy

It may seem hard to believe today, but back in the 1970s, one of the
hottest stock groups was Construction and Engineering. These C&E firms
managed mega-projects, including oil refineries and pipelines in the Middle
East, and were minting money because of the oil shortage. But during the
past decade, the energy crisis seemed like only a distant memory. And even
the best C&E firms, such as Fluor [FLR], ran into trouble.

For most of the late 1990s, Fluor's earnings were stagnant. The company
over-expanded in 1994 and subsequently began missing its growth targets. As
the problems got worse, the stock fell from a high of $75 a share in 1997
to less than $23 early last year.

To fix these problems, Fluor decided it would be smart to split the company
in half, separating its C&E businesses from its coal-mining operations,
which now trade as Massey Energy [MEE]. Since the split late last year,
Flour has been doing well and appears poised for even better times to come.

But this improved performance has gone unnoticed by many investors because
the division of the company and the shift of its reporting schedule from a
fiscal to a calendar year have made earnings comparisons difficult. In
fact, some research sources have stopped following the stock altogether.

That's a pity because the outlook for energy is better than it's been in a
decade. The scare of higher crude prices should greatly improve prospects
for oil projects, while electricity shortages in California -- and possibly
in other states as well -- will encourage the construction of power plants.
In fact, a joint venture between Duke Energy and Fluor is one of the
world's leading contractors and has the largest U.S. market share for the
construction of natural-gas-fired power plants. Two weeks ago, the
partnership was awarded a contract to help build two power plants in
Massachusetts.

Fluor's share price has climbed more than 50 percent since its
restructuring, and several major brokerages have upgraded the stock to a
"buy" on the strength of Fluor's improved business outlook.

At a current $51 a share, Fluor trades at 26 times this year's estimated
earnings. Profits are projected to gain 18 percent next year and then
continue to grow at a core annual rate of about 15 percent. And those
estimates could easily prove to be too low if the climate for energy turns
out to be more positive in the next five years than it has been in the past
five. And to me, that looks like a pretty good bet.

Face-off on McDonald's

Is the world's number-one fast-food chain really poised for a comeback --
or is the stock depressed for good reason.

By Michael Sivy

MONEY editor-at-large Ken Kurson and Michael Sivy go head-to-head over this
column's recommendation of McDonald's (see Supersize this Stock!
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/010514.html ]).
On Monday, Sivy argued that the stock is a good buy even though it appears
beset with problems -- the economic slowdown in the U.S.; fears about
mad-cow disease and hoof-and-mouth disease that have depressed beef
consumption in Europe; and the chronically weak euro, which reduces the
value of McDonald's European profits. Sivy believes that these problems
will soon pass, profit growth will pick up again, and the stock's valuation
-- well below historical levels -- will climb back toward normal. Kurson
doesn't buy it. Their debate follows:

Kurson
This time you've gone too far! How can you possibly like anything about
McDonald's -- either the business OR the stock? (I'm assuming you at LEAST
detest the food.) Yes, the valuations are cheap next to its own historical
averages, but NOT against competitors. The PEG ratio is by far highest in
the group: McDonald's PEG is 1.39 versus 1.01 for Brinker [EAT], 0.99 for
CBRL Group [CBRL], 1.06 for Darden [DRI] and a lowly 0.95 for Tricon [YUM]
(despite those endless delicious stuffed crust innovations at Pizza Hut).
And McDonald's price/sales ratio is more than TWICE any of its competitors.

And for what? A proven ability in the PAST to build faster and a net profit
margin that's the envy of the sector. But as your column points out,
overseas is where the opportunity is and also where the problems are. You
say the problems will pass, but I totally disagree. Mad-cow disease and
hoof-and-mouth disease MAY be temporary, faddish, fashionable concerns. I
happen to think they're not so easily dismissed, but even conceding that
point, it doesn't get at the root of MCD's failure to replicate overseas
the disgusting (and disgustingly profitable) empire it has erected here.
Evidence? Japan, where MCD is planning a piddling 220 new stores in 2001
(versus 360 in 2000). That's the company's second biggest market (bigger
than Europe) and there are concerns about profit margins there, as well.

You rightly point out the company relied too heavily on promotional
gimmicks. But then you give MCD points for totally ridiculous stuff like
high-end coffee at their McCafes. Yeah, right. I'm sure Starbucks is
quaking in its boots. Just like Pizza Hut was terrified by McPizza.

Sivy
The short response to the points you raise is that I don't really believe
in securities analysis.

Here's the longer version: I don't believe that projections of a company's
business trends are more reliable than the stock's actual track record and
natural statistical tendencies, such as regression to the mean. If analysts
couldn't anticipate the effect of telecom infrastructure overbuilding on
Cisco's business, they can't anticipate anything.

Fact is, McDonald's has proved remarkably resilient over time, despite its
mediocre products. The same arguments you make now have been made before.
And yet McDonald's has retained its dominant position relative to Tricon
and Wendy's and other smaller chains.

When globalization was a hot concept right after the Berlin Wall fell,
companies with global franchises enjoyed excellent growth. Now "globaloney"
is out of fashion and no one is willing to pay up for such franchises (that
goes for U.S. packaged food companies too).

At the moment, everything is going against McDonald's stock. But most of
the these trends are cyclical, in one way or another. The U.S. economy will
turn. And the McDonald's marketing machine will improve its success rate.
And sooner or later, the stock's multiple will improve. I'm not looking for
the next Dell Computer, but I do think that from this price the return on
McDonald's will beat a 12 percent hurdle rate.

As to the current backlash against beef, I regard it as a temporary -- and
rather ridiculous -- expression of deviant psychology. Basically, the same
sorts of people who supported North Vietnam in the '60s have redirected
their self-hatred from the national to the personal level. This leads to
body-piercing, food phobias, and incompetent riots at international
free-trade meetings. This too shall pass -- or at least be redirected again
to rescuing mink, or something.

Kurson
I, too, place no faith in securities *analysts*, and thus share your
suspicion about growth-rate projections. But I certainly believe in
securities *analysis*, and you do, too, because that's what it is to
recommend MCD based upon its history, the cyclical nature of the economy,
the foolhardiness of those who oppose beef. These all fit comfortably under
the heading of traditional analysis, and I don't see any percentage in
throwing out all the tools just because a couple of them display the greasy
fingerprints of sell-side analysts.

As for your point about past record being more compelling, yeah, I give a
company credit for a track record. But only when there's a forward-looking
justification for why that success (and higher valuation) will continue. I
mean, if a stock costs more than the stock of its peers because the company
is doing things differently and is hard to imitate, I'm willing to afford
it some juice. But if a stock costs more simply because it always has, I'm
skeptical. Especially when things have changed to make previous advantages
less impressive -- as I believe has happened to McDonald's. That's why I
cited the sharp fall-off of store openings in Japan.

Any drop in beef consumption may very well be temporary: There's clearly no
limit to how fat Americans are willing to become and like a lot of trends,
we're way out in front and I expect the rest of the world to follow suit in
time. However, I DON'T think McDonald's will continue to show the dominance
in fulfilling that demand, or at least continue to do so way better than
competitors.

Sivy
Where I differ with you is that I have a far greater skepticism toward all
trend projections, even though I acknowledge that we have to use them to
value stocks.

Just as economists have predicted 19 of the past seven recessions,
securities analysts tend to over-predict changes in earnings trends. What
really changes, though, is the level of valuations. A decade ago, everyone
loved companies with global brand names. Now they ignore those stocks. I
tend to think that the fashion has changed far more than the underlying
fundamentals. Statistically, it's most successful to bet on companies with
strong track records when they're off their game and valuations are low --
that's true even if you can't predict where their next success will come from.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
May 4, 2001

Staggering toward profits

The economic numbers are hard to sort out, and some analysts are talking
about stagflation. The best stocks for this environment include consumer
products companies like Procter & Gamble.

By Michael Sivy

The most recent economic data all contradict each other. First we hear that
real gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the first
quarter -- a stunner, because just about everyone was expecting growth to
be down from the 1 percent rate of the fourth quarter. So no need to worry
about recession, right? But then we get employment data that shows payroll
numbers tumbling and unemployment up from 4.3 percent to 4.5 percent. In
addition, inflation pressures -- particularly labor costs -- are moving
ominously higher. Economists are starting to talk about stagflation, the
awful combination of inflation and low growth. The last time they did that
we had an oil crisis and a horrific bear market.

Don't take any of this too seriously. Confusion and economic cross-currents
are normal at this point in the business cycle. What we're seeing now is
the regular churning that occurs as the economy completes a slowdown and
struggles to get back on a growth track. For investors, the key is to
isolate the trends that really matter.

The most important one is that the economy as a whole is still growing.
Despite lots of scattered bad news, we still haven't has a single quarter
of declining GDP. We might get one, but it's hard to imagine that we'll get
two really bad quarters back to back -- and that's what defines a
recession. At worst, it looks as though we'll get what they used to call a
"growth recession" back in the 1960s -- a drop more or less to zero, but
not a meaningful decline.

That's basically good news for corporate profits. Companies can maintain
earnings during a brief growth recession by cutting costs. And a modest
rise in unemployment is also positive for corporate America, because it
makes jobs easier to fill, and restrains labor costs.

An uptick in unemployment is also likely to encourage the Federal Reserve
to cut interest rates. The majority of Fedwatchers expect chairman Alan
Greenspan to reduce rates at least a quarter percentage point at the next
Fed meeting on May 15. The continuing trend toward lower rates will
encourage home refinancing, which will add another $100 or $200 a month to
some household budgets and help keep overall consumer spending healthy.

What stocks are most timely at this point in the cycle? As I've said
before, I think that the big money over the next five years will be made on
the largest tech stocks. Nearer term, I think we could see strong
performance among defensive consumer stocks -- the shares of companies that
sell everyday products. No one is going to stop buying toothpaste or
detergent because of a mild economic slowdown. And a whiff of inflation is
actually good for consumer stocks because it makes it easier to raise
product prices.

One obvious candidate is Procter & Gamble [PG], with brands that include
Tide, Ivory, Head & Shoulders and Charmin. The stock has dipped since I
last recommended it, but since April 24, P&G has risen 12 percent. And I
expect that rally to continue.

P&G has a number of big issues. The company is in the midst of a
restructuring, and it could take a while to work through all the kinks. In
addition, P&G is bidding to acquire Clairol from Bristol-Myers Squibb. But
over the next year, P&G should emerge from its restructuring as a more
focused collection of extremely attractive businesses. What matters most
now is that the stock is depressed and that sales won't be exposed to any
significant economic downturn.

This past week, P&G announced a surprisingly solid 9.4 percent gain in
operating profits for the first quarter. Much of that was from price
increases. Still, analysts thought the results were encouraging, and
Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the stock to "outperform." Full-year growth
this year and next may be only around 7 percent, but P&G's growth rate
could be back above 10 percent by sometime next year. Add in a 2.1 percent
yield, and you're talking about above-average total return potential. At a
current price of $64 a share, P&G is trading at less than 21 times this
year's estimated earnings. That's pretty cheap, and any successful results
from the restructuring would just be gravy.

Pete,

I'm seeing some trades with your name as Trader which are at extremely high 
prices.   Transco Z6 vs. Henry Hub trades at prices of $15.6025 from Trade 
Date of 12/5.  Are these errors?  EOL numbers are 658961 and 658985 (both 
with Reliant).  No confirmation has been sent on these.  Please have your 
Book Admin notify me as soon as you get a chance to look at these.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

 Today's Hottest Travel Deals from Bestfares.com!
 

We have a mix-match of airfare deals around the world to finish the week. Be 
sure to review our deals to Canada from as low as $87 roundtrip through June 
14, 2001. Tickets for this sale must be purchased by tonight, May 10, 2001. 
Our international fares have been extended for purchase through May 15, 2001. 
Can you believe that we have coast-to-coast airfares starting as low as $58, 
$68, $78, $88 and $98 roundtrip through October 26, 2001? We also have many 
other fares for $198 roundtrip or less, good through October 26. Again if you 
want dirt-cheap airfares to Canada, act fast. 



OUR SPRING EUROPE SALE CONTINUES THROUGH MAY 15, '01 


We have just received approval to extend our very aggressive airfares to 
Europe for ticketing through May 15, 2001. Airfares to Amsterdam, Brussels 
and Zurich are as low as $255 roundtrip through June 30, 2001. Airfares to 
Frankfurt, Munich or Stuttgart start at $283 roundtrip and Paris starts at 
$299 roundtrip. All travel for our Europe specials must be completed by June 
30, 2001. Visit

FINAL DAY: DIRT-CHEAP FARES TO MONTREAL, TORONTO & OTTAWA 


Thursday, May 10, 2001 is the final day to purchase dirt-cheap airfares to 
Canada for travel through June 14. Can you believe that airfares from Los 
Angeles, San Diego, Seattle and San Francisco to Ottawa, Toronto or Montreal 
are only $173 roundtrip through June 14, 2001? How about $160 roundtrip from 
Phoenix? If you thought that those airfares were low, how about Austin, San 
Antonio, New Orleans, Raleigh, Baltimore, Kansas City, Indianapolis, 
Nashville, Knoxville, Louisville, Milwaukee, Greensboro, Fort Lauderdale, 
Tampa, Jacksonville or Charleston (SC) to Montreal, Toronto or Ottawa for 
only $125 roundtrip? Can we go lower? You betcha! New York City to Montreal, 
$87 roundtrip. Why not visit a destination where the exchange rate is super. 
For example, $100 in the U.S. equals $154 Canadian. Take off this spring with 
great airfares and great exchange rates with this Bestfares.com double whammy 
of a deal for May 2001, visit 
http://www.bestfares.com/travel/desks/story.asp?id=55

EARN UP TO QUADRUPLE AIRMILES TO EUROPE THROUGH JULY 15, '01 


If you're traveling to Europe this spring with more than one family member, 
then don't miss the opportunity to earn up to quadruple airmiles. Not only 
can you save big bucks, but you could end up with enough miles for a free 
ticket. You must depart by June 15 and return by July 15, 2001. Kids (ages 
two-11) can save an additional 20 percent off the already low adult fares. 
For example, the roundtrip miles between Los Angeles and Amsterdam are over 
11,000. A family of three can save big bucks and also earn enough miles for a 
free U.S. domestic ticket. A family of four would have enough miles for a 
ticket back to Europe. Visit 
http://www.bestfares.com/travel/desks/story.asp?id=18167

Plus                             7 other reasons to shop  early

8.

FREE                             SHIPPING on all  orders over $100, through 
November                             22.
?

7.

We've                             teamed  up with Toysrus.com  to offer you 
toys and savings so massive, even  our                             North Pole 
competitors are envious. 
?

6.
Create                           a Wish List      at Amazon.com and you just 
might win everything on  it--up                           to $5,000. Woo-hoo!
?
5.
By                           shopping early at  Amazon.com,  you eliminate 
stress. Carolers won't seem nearly  as                           irritating. 
?
4.
Though                           reindeer are  cute, our delivery service is 
more reliable.                           And  no fog delays. 
?
3.
                           You can browse through all 17 of our  stores 
without                           being accosted by a persistent  perfume 
sales clerk.
?
2.
                           Free parking. 
?
1.
SHIPPING                           IS FREE on  orders of $100 or more. (Our 
Head Elf made                           us say  that again.)

Dear RealMoney.com Subscribers,

It's hysterically funny what people are demanding
of my personal account. People want it updated
immediately and they want the ideas ahead of when
I actually buy (I am doing that). In fact I am letting
our readers front-run me on everything! I reveal what
I am about to recommend and I recommend before I buy.

That's the total antidote to the way Wall Street works.
They want to know how much money I am putting into each
stock. Done. They want the dates that I did it. Harder
because I buy in small increments. They want my stop-loss
limits if I could stop-loss out. I can't do that because
of my holding period, but I will do it anyway and just
not sell. They want better performance and they want it
yesterday or at least when I started this game, and the
market was much higher.

Hey, I am listening! Exclusively on RealMoney.com, you
now have access to my own Personal Portfolio, which is
made up of my picks, shares owned, basis, current value
and gains that he buys and sells on a day-to-day basis.

As of Friday, the portfolio market value is $1,247,537
making me a profit of $124,650.03.

Don=01,t miss a move, click here to see what I am up to:

next year, please contact me.  For more information about Christmas in
April, log on to: www.christmasinapril.org.

For information about the Bronx, please read below.

To ensure a fun-filled day, please read the following carefully:

? Please be at Jimmy's Bronx Caf,, 281 West Fordham Road (at the corner of
the Major Degan) Bronx, NY (718-329-2000) by 7:00 A.M. on Saturday, April
28th for registration and orientation.  Breakfast will be served, t-shirts
distributed, and all Christmas in April*Bronx volunteers will be there so
it should be fun to see that we are part of a much larger effort.
? For your convenience, we will have a Ram Van that will pick up volunteers
at 6:00 A.M. at our Lincoln Center campus, and then at approximately 6:30
A.M. in front of the McGinley Center on our Rose Hill campus.
? Transportation to our Christmas in April site will be provided at Jimmy's
Bronx Caf,.
? Lunch will be provided at our site.
? Beverages and snacks will be provided at our site throughout the day.
? Plan on being at our site until 5:00pm.  In some cases, the work is
completed earlier, and in others, later.
? If you have any special dietary or medical needs, it is your
responsibility to ensure they are met.
? Do not bring any valuables with you.  They will be your responsibility.
? If you bring tools or other supplies with you, they too are your
responsibility.
? The work is very messy and includes painting, please dress accordingly.

Please feel free to bring additional volunteers with you; all are welcome.
If you are interested in attending, please email or call Betsy Boland
(212-636-6521, elboland@fordham.edu) so we will know how many volunteers to
expect.

Our day volunteering for Christmas in April will surely be exciting,
fulfilling and rewarding.

Phone glut

Lucent continues to suffer. Will the stock recover anytime soon? And will
overcapacity problems in the industry spread to other telecom stocks?

By Michael Sivy

Lucent [LU] is the Florida of the telecom sector. It's big, it's booming
and it can't stop bungling. Lucent's latest foul-up was announced Tuesday:
The company said it would have to revise down the results reported for the
September quarter because of errors in the way sales were recorded. Even
worse, management said it won't be able to provide analysts with reliable
earnings guidance for the current quarter.

The real problem isn't the money -- third-quarter earnings will be hit by
just about 2 cents a share -- it's the principle of the thing. Investors
always turn skeptical when a company overstates its prospects only to lower
its sights later on. And Lucent has been pulling the rug out from under
analysts all year. Investors get even more nervous when a company mentions
accounting mistakes, no matter how small or innocent they seem. So Lucent's
most recent announcement sent the stock as low as $16.50, down more than 75
percent from the start of the year, before recovering to $17.75.

Lucent's latest troubles raise several questions for investors: What are
the company's problems? What are the implications for the entire telecom
sector? And what do Lucent's recurrent selloffs mean for value-oriented
investors in today's market? The last question is easiest to answer. We're
in the middle of a downtrend for technology stocks. Companies that
disappoint investors will receive little mercy. And it's very easy to get
burned by a stock that appears to have bottomed. I feel that particularly
keenly, since I recommended Lucent in July as a value play at $44 a share,
after it was already down nearly 50 percent from its all-time high (see
"The shining").
[ http://www.money.com/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000731.html ]

As for Lucent's problems, two are unique to the company itself, and both
result from its spinoff from AT&T in 1996. For more than a century, Lucent
had been able to rely on the Bell System as a captive customer, and so the
newly independent company failed to keep up with competitors in key areas
like optical technology. Second, Lucent is still reshuffling top management
to find a team that can get both the product line and the accounting system
in good running order.

The broader question is what Lucent's troubles indicate about the telecom
sector. Basically, the entire sector is suffering from various forms of
overcapacity. All the telecom companies geared up in one way or another for
much more business than has actually materialized. The result -- when
supply outruns demand -- is cutbacks in purchases of capital equipment and
falling prices.

Those short-term problems can be painful, but excess capacity always gets
used up -- and often far faster than analysts expect. So I imagine that
within a year or two, all telecom companies will face a firmer pricing
environment and their share prices will rally.

I believe that investors who want to build a long-term position in
technology need to own telecom stocks. It's impossible to know when any
particular stock will bottom -- in the short run, any telecom-related stock
could go lower, and not even the most successful, such as Cisco [CSCO] and
Nortel Networks [NT], are completely safe. But stocks like AT&T [T] and
WorldCom [WCOM], as well as Lucent, all are trading at least a third below
their asset value. You have to buy when stocks look undervalued and then
hang on without flinching if they go lower. The long-term profit potential
is there. And the best protection is diversification and patience.

Three distinctly different approaches to American history. 

[IMAGE]"The American Century" 
by Harold Evans
Harold Evans's tight, journalistic prose marks the significant events and 
personages in America's rise to superpower status in this sprawling yet

[IMAGE]"The Great Republic: A History of America" 
by Sir Winston Churchill and Winston S. Churchill
Everyone knows Winston Churchill as the great statesman who helped sail 
Britain's ship of state through World War II. Less noticeable have been 
Churchill's contributions as a historian and author. Many of his numerous 
histories contain information on the United States--from America's discovery 
to the nation's founding and up to the mid-20th century. Grandson Winston S. 
Churchill has edited this work into one volume, titled "The Great Republic," 
now available in paperback. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]"Lies Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong" 
by James W. Loewen
Little seems to delight historian James W. Loewen more than picking apart the 
cherished myths of American history. Few Americans study history after high 
school--instead, Loewen writes, they turn to roadside historical markers, 
guidebooks, museums, and tours of battlefields, childhood homes, and massacre 
sites. After finishing Loewen's alternately angry and bemused expos,, readers 
will likely never trust a roadside historical marker or tour guide 
again--which may prompt them to turn to history books to check things out for 
themselves. [IMAGE]Read more

by Joseph J. Ellis
In retrospect, it seems as if the American Revolution was inevitable. But was 
it? In "Founding Brothers," Joseph J. Ellis reveals that many of those truths 
we hold to be self-evident were actually fiercely contested in the early days 
of the republic. [IMAGE]Read more

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

on the routers, and replacing

Pete,

I'm seeing some trades with your name as Trader which are at extremely high 
prices.   Transco Z6 vs. Henry Hub trades at prices of $15.6025 from Trade 
Date of 12/5.  Are these errors?  EOL numbers are 658961 and 658985 (both 
with Reliant).  No confirmation has been sent on these.  Please have your 
Book Admin notify me as soon as you get a chance to look at these.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20

=20
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=

me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

6. Readers' Opinions: Wines for a Vegetarian Barbecue
=====================================================

>From stuffed pepper recipes to wines for a vegetarian
barbecue, readers share their insights and answer fellow
readers' questions.

Q. I'm going to have a barbecue. Most of the guests are
vegetarians. Menu is veggie burgers, grilled veggies, a
couple of great big salads and decadent creamy desserts
(including a cheesecake). I'm going to have some beer, but
I've noticed that most of the group drinks wine. What should
I offer them? Not too expensive please -- I want to please
them, not close a business deal. -- springinbloomBeth

A. You can get some terrific and crisp whites and medium to
light body reds for under $15 a bottle...

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
April 20, 2001

Bigger is better

Tech stocks are coming back, and giants that dominate important markets are
likely to lead the advance. At the forefront of that group is Microsoft, as
the company's latest earnings report shows.

By Michael Sivy

"It may be that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong -- but that is the way to bet," said Damon Runyon, whose short
stories about the hustlers of New York City's theater district served as
the basis for the musical "Guys and Dolls." Runyon's street-smart
observation is good advice for today's stock market. It may be that almost
all computer and telecommunications stocks were hurt in the Tech Wreck of
the past year. But not all of them will rebound equally as the economy
improves. Some dot-coms are gone for good. And many small tech stocks have
permanently lost market share. But the biggest tech companies, which
dominate important industry sectors, are likely to lead a powerful advance.

The next six months will be tough for technology companies, with excess
inventories and infrastructure overcapacity afflicting industries such as
semiconductors and telecom. But the longer term outlook argues powerfully
for a rebound. Over most of the past century, stocks have gained
substantially -- as much as 65 percent -- in the 18 months following four
straight interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. And as soon as
investors are convinced that the worst is past and that the outlook for the
next few years will be increasingly positive, they'll begin moving money
into the most solid tech choices.

That's essentially what has been happening with Microsoft [MSFT]. The share
price dropped to less than $41 in December. But since the Fed began cutting
rates in January, the stock has climbed a whopping 70 percent to nearly $69
a share. And on Thursday, Microsoft's rebound was reinforced by a
surprisingly good first-quarter report. It wasn't that earnings were so
high -- they were only a couple of cents a share above expectations. But
both analysts and investors were impressed by how well Microsoft's
businesses are holding up.

In the first quarter, Microsoft's revenues climbed 14 percent from
year-earlier levels. Sales were particularly solid for upgrades of the
Windows operating systems used by corporations and for server software. And
though the company indicated that earnings growth for the next couple of
quarters would be flattish, the revenue outlook remains quite positive. For
next fiscal year, which begins in July, earnings are projected to improve
by a bit less than 10 percent.

That near-term growth alone can justify Microsoft's 35 P/E, based projected
earnings for next year. But investors aren't looking at current profits.
They want to know whether the franchise is strong -- and whether it's
getting stronger. The answer to both questions is yes. And since Microsoft
is a massive cash generator -- with $30 billion in liquid assets -- it
shouldn't ever have to worry about financial problems.

Microsoft provides such a broad range of software products that it can
thrive even if sales of personal computers remain low. Further, the
company's large established base of users means that upgrades can boost
revenues even when sales of new software products are unimpressive. Most
important of all, by the end of the year Microsoft will have upgraded most
of its important products. That means that the world's software giant
figures to be at the forefront of the next market advance once the current
bear market is clearly over and the economy is in an upswing again.

1. Main Course: For Oysters, the Raw and the Cooked
===================================================

The iced-and-shucked variety of oysters will always have its
fans, but cooked oysters aren't just for the apprehensive
eater.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/25/living/25OYST.html?0425wd

Pork Belly: Living Low on the Hog

Is it a meaty fat or a fatty meat? Either way, the tempting
pork belly shows true genius when it's cooked.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/25/living/25BELL.html?0425wd


2. Recipe of the Week: Spinach, Oyster and Chorizo Stew
=======================================================

This rich, multifaceted stew is one example of what cooked
oysters can add to a dish.

The Minimalist: Broiled Fish with Green Tea Salt

tea with an accent of salt.

3. Wine List: Chardonnay Finds Its Inner Finesse
================================================

Chardonnay is not only America's favorite white wine, it's
also become the whipping boy for wine lovers who see it as a
garish emblem of much that is wrong with wine today. But
quietly, some California wine producers have developed a
crisper, more lively Chardonnay, using an older style of
winemaking.

5. NYC Restaurants: A Find, Once Found
======================================

Virot's namesake chef, Didier Virot, is inventive, with an
antic streak. He takes risks. Some of them don't pay off.
But diners will not leave Virot feeling that they've had an
ordinary meal. (Two stars.)

The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one 
that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  

 What should the consistent market convention for determining the first 
tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the 
premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second.  
This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the 
calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have 
to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.  
Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would 
eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I 
will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product 
description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily 
be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  

I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get 
back to you .

Thanks 

Pete

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
November 10, 2000

Leader of the free world

Thank goodness Fed chairman Alan Greenspan doesn't have to win in Florida.
Plus: More on Microsoft and John Malone's Liberty Media.

By Michael Sivy

It just keeps getting worse. I've listened to explanations on TV of what
the absentee ballots could mean and what kinds of litigation are possible.
I've read conspiracy theories online about what Jeb Bush did to tilt the
election and how electors could switch sides on December 18. I've heard
scenarios on talk radio about how Strom Thurmond could become president and
how the dolphins saved Elian so that Cuban-Americans would turn out in
numbers large enough to put George W. over the top. I can't bear to listen
to any of it anymore.

Fortunately, I don't have to. We have a president. Come January, we'll have
another president. Congress will be evenly split. And one more thing: Alan
Greenspan will still be the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Thank goodness
he doesn't have to be elected in Florida. What he does over the next six
months will determine how much the economy slows and what kind of stock
market we'll have over the next four years. So let's review the facts (and
the probabilities).

Whichever candidate becomes president, there will be only a moderate tax
cut and limited expansion of government spending. That will mean that the
budget surplus will be bigger than if either candidate had a strong
mandate. A bigger budget surplus means that the volume of Treasury bonds
outstanding will shrink -- and that will encourage long-term interest rates
to fall.

That will give Greenspan room to cut short-term interest rates. He most
likely won't do it at next week's Fed meeting, given the election disarray
and the fact that unemployment is still below 4 percent, a level that's
generally considered inflationary. However, the economy continues to show
signs of slowing, core PPI inflation (excluding food and energy) was
actually down last month, and it looks as though productivity will be quite
strong over the next couple of quarters. So look for rate cuts early next 
year.

That's a great environment for bonds, and for many stock groups. But first,
we have to get through the current slowdown. Tech stocks continue to slide
and could get hit even harder during the next six weeks as overextended
money managers cut back their tech weightings. There are plenty of other
cheap stock groups, but recognize that some may continue to pull back
between now and year-end. Keep your eye on the long-term, though, and
you'll get some great buys.

There are, however, a couple of specific stocks I'd consider right now,
particularly if you're an aggressive investor. The first is Liberty Media
Group [LMG.A], which I recommended in September at $19 a share (see "The
media master is back").
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000927.html ]
The stock price has since fallen to $16.25, dragged down by the company's
intimate connection with AT&T. This week, however, Malone said in an
interview that he would like to sever ties to AT&T. Liberty has great
assets and could thrive on its own -- and it looks as though Malone is
ready to make a move. I'd bet on him.

In addition, I think Microsoft is a good buy, even though it has rebounded
from lows below $49 to $67. I don't pretend to be an expert on computers
and I know that Microsoft's results for the current quarter could be lame.
But the reports I see indicate that Windows 2000 could start boosting
revenues substantially next year. And over the next five years, Microsoft
could turn in earnings growth averaging more than 20 percent annually.
Those earnings alone should propel the stock, and that rapid growth should
lead to some multiple expansion as well. Moreover, as time goes by the
government's case against Microsoft becomes moot. And the next president is
going to be so busy trying to outlaw butterfly ballots, he isn't going to
have a lot of time to beat up on Bill Gates.

Richard,

After going throught the numbers on this peaker. I can only pay 4-5 cents for 
a 10 day peaker at Chicago. That would be a net payment to you of 
$604,000. 

You are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and I will pay 10% of the 
underlying price to get the optionality.  As a relative value NYZ6 or Socal 
is worth much more.  Alliance seems to have taken all of the strong interest 
out of this market. Hunter won't pay any additional premium as Chicago is too 
liquid physically to justify a premium for the molecules.  

Call me to go over the numbers if you want 

Pete

Notice # 01-156
May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Rule 6.57A.     END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close

Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of  five (5) minutes
in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the following
conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
twelve listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract and as further expanded above the
daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of

Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week

HISTORY: BEST OF 2000 

Editor, Sunny Delaney


 [IMAGE]	I admit it--I have an odd range of interests. But my editor's picks 
for 2000 do share a few characteristics. Whether the topic is the Battle of 
Iwo Jima, the American Revolution, early Britain, or a terrible fire, these 
top 10 history books all have strong narratives and compelling 
protagonists--in addition to meticulous research and attention to detail.  
	
	Ten not enough for you, either? Check out my 15 honorable mentions. 

EDITOR'S CHOICE 
[IMAGE]1. "Flags of Our Fathers" 
by James Bradley and Ron Powers
Five days after the landing on Iwo Jima, a platoon of marines and a navy 
corpsman climbed Mount Suribachi to raise the American flag. Joe Rosenthal 
snapped a quick photo--one that became a 20th-century icon. "Flags of Our 
Fathers" describes the Battle of Iwo Jima through the lives of the flag 
raisers--and their families. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]2. "The Day the American Revolution Began: 19 April 1775" 
by William H. Hallahan
Early on the morning of April 19, 1775, the British marched into Lexington to 
capture a rebel arsenal. A shot was fired, the British attacked, and the 
American Revolution began in earnest. "The Day the American Revolution Began" 
describes the nascent revolution and the way colonists responded to the news.

[IMAGE]3. "From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 
to the Present" 
by Jacques Barzun
Cultural critic and historian Jacques Barzun examines a variety of 
revolutions that have swept the Western world over the past 500 years in 
"From Dawn to Decadence." Whether he's examining the scientific revolution or 
religious experimentation, Barzun succeeds in revealing how the events of the 
past are reflected in the present. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]4. "To the Best of My Ability: The American Presidents" 
edited by James M. McPherson and David Rubel 
As we approach the end of this presidential election year, we might do well 
to look back at those who have held the office. In "To the Best of My 
Ability," 32 members of the Society of American Historians write about those 
41 men, Washington to Clinton, and explore the campaigns, elections, 
presidency, and legacy of each. [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]5. "In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex" 
by Nathaniel Philbrick
The harrowing account of the whaleship Essex--think "The Endurance" without 
the happy ending--is enough to hold anyone's attention. The crew of the 
Essex, their ship rammed and sunk by a whale, spent weeks at sea in light 
boats with very limited food and water. In the end, the sailors were forced 
to make a terrible choice while drifting "In the Heart of the Sea." [IMAGE]

by Stewart O'Nan
As some 9,000 people watched the Wallendas begin their high-wire act on July 
6, 1944, a fire started on the sidewall of the bigtop. In minutes, the entire 
tent was engulfed in flames. Stewart O'Nan brings his remarkable storytelling 
ability to the tragedy of "The Circus Fire." [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]7. "Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the 
Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869" 
by Stephen E. Ambrose
Abraham Lincoln was convinced that the United States would flourish only if 
its far-flung regions were linked, replacing sectional loyalties with an 
overarching sense of national destiny. Building a transcontinental railroad, 
therefore, was second only to the abolition of slavery on his presidential 
agenda. Stephen E. Ambrose examines the building of the railroad--and the 
experiences of the everyday "Joes" involved--in "Nothing Like It in the 
World." [IMAGE]Read more

[IMAGE]8. "A History of Britain: At the Edge of the World, 3500 B.C.-1603 
A.D." 
by Simon Schama
Combining the resources of the BBC with Simon Schama's literary panache, "A 
History of Britain" is a beautifully written, handsomely crafted book on the 
sceptered isle. From pre-Roman Britain through the reign of Elizabeth I, 
Schama's lucid prose is embellished with dozens of striking illustrations. An 
excellent general history, and highly recommended. [IMAGE]Read more

When peace finally came in November 1918, four years of fierce fighting and 
unprecedented bloodshed was over. "Victory 1918" tells the story of the Great 
War, its leaders, its terrors, and its blunders--and it makes the worldwide 
relief felt at the end of the war all the more understandable. [IMAGE]Read

 From Sivy's mailbox

Here are my answers to recent e-mails about tech, telecom, John Malone and
junk bonds.

By Michael Sivy

I've been receiving a lot of e-mail lately about both the election and the
carnage in tech stocks, and it's hard to say which upsets readers more. The
one thing that seems fairly certain is that neither is over yet.

The Florida Supreme Court may force a decision on the election before
Thanksgiving -- or the legal wrangling may continue for several weeks.
Either way, we're looking at gridlock in Washington. That means the surplus
will balloon, as increases in government spending and tax cuts are both
stymied.

The swelling surplus could reduce the outstanding volume of Treasury bonds
by as much as 15 percent over the next couple of years. That would be very
bullish for all high-quality bonds -- Treasury, agency, blue-chip corporate
and municipal. On the other hand, using the surplus to reduce debt instead
of spending it (or returning it to taxpayers who would spend it) would sap
the economy's energy. That could mean more earnings disappointments from
economically sensitive companies over the next couple of months.

In the long run, though, gridlock could lay the foundation for a resumption
of the stock market boom. Debt reduction and an economic slowdown will
probably encourage Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to cut interest rates
substantially next year, which would be a boon to the overall market.

Now here's a look at some specific questions:

What's up with Cisco and Oracle?
The Nasdaq has been getting walloped and is now down 40 percent from its
highs. I've said that the damage to the tech sector isn't over and that the
group may not rally as usual going into the new year. Earnings fears are
the chief cause of the selloff. In addition, the most popular tech stocks
on the Nasdaq, such as Cisco and Oracle, carry P/Es as high as 50. I
imagine that there will be a great buying opportunity for these stocks --
but they could get cheaper still.

When are the big telecoms, such as AT&T, WorldCom and Lucent going to come
back?

I've recommended all three of these stocks as value buys (see "The shining"
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000731.html ] and
"After the tech wreck"
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001101.html ]).
And though each has since dropped, I still believe each has asset values at
least 50 percent above current share prices. But in this environment, they
probably won't rebound quickly. If I already owned them, I'd certainly hold
them. And I'd consider buying now, though there's no rush. Lucent looks
like the most straightforward play, followed by WorldCom. AT&T presents the
most potential problems.

What's going on with Liberty Media and why can't I find the ticker symbol?

I've recommended Liberty Media Group a couple of times (see "The media
master is back" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000927.html ] and
"Leader of the free world" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001110.html ]).
Since AT&T acquired cable TV giant TCI, Liberty's programming operations
have traded as an AT&T tracking stock with the symbol LMG, class A. On some
quote systems, the symbol is given as LMGa, on others as LMG_A. If you
can't find it, try the MONEY.COM Website, where the stock is LMG.A [LMG.A].

To my mind, the case for Liberty is the case for John Malone. He was the
master of the industry back when he was CEO of TCI, but he nearly
disappeared from view after the acquisition. Now with the spotlight back on
Liberty, Malone has the chance to be a player again, particularly since
AT&T has announced that it intends to spin off Liberty as an independent
company.

If the slowing economy is bullish for bonds, why is my high-yield bond fund
down almost 10 percent?

The slowing economy and the prospect for lower interest rates are extremely
bullish for bonds of unquestioned financial strength. Junk bonds suffer in
an economy slowdown, however, because investors worry that the companies'
chances of default will increase. If you own a junk mutual fund, though,
I'd hang on at this point (I have a junk fund too and I'm down nearly 10
percent). The worst of the decline is most likely behind us, and junk bonds
can rally powerfully after an economic slowdown ends.

Waiting for the payoff

Cable television independent Comcast has a terrific franchise, but the
stock has gone nowhere. Now it looks ready to pay off.

By Michael Sivy

Sometimes businesses have great franchises and are well run, but you'd
never know it from the share price. Momentum investors would tell you to
dump such a stock because the market just doesn't like it. Not me. It can
sometimes take three or four years for a stock's price to catch up with its
fundamentals, and if you're really a long-term investor, you should be
willing to wait. As superstar investor Warren Buffett says, the stock
market transfers money from the active to the patient.

A perfect case in point is Comcast [CMCSK], the No. 3 cable television
company (after AT&T and AOL Time Warner, the owner of this website). I
recommended Comcast stock in December 1999 at $52 a share and over the next
five months it fell 40 percent to around $30 a share, at which point I
recommended it again. Now, at $44, I still like what I see.

There were several reasons for last year's decline. Most cable stocks
dropped in the initial phases of the Tech Wreck (although most of them
turned up long before other tech stocks did). Comcast also suffered after
reporting lower-than-expected earnings for last year's first quarter, in
part because of expenses associated with acquisitions. In addition, because
85 percent of the company's voting stock is held by insiders, the potential
for a takeover doesn't support the stock when it becomes undervalued.

Comcast's dealmaking may have hurt reported earnings last year, but it has
greatly enhanced the long-term value of the company's franchise. Through
strategic sales, purchases and swaps, Comcast has sharpened the focus of
its cable territories, which are centered on the greater Philadelphia
market. In addition, Comcast has aggressively upgraded its systems to use
the latest digital technology. Moreover, the company has valuable
investments in other businesses, including a 57 percent stake in the QVC
home-shopping network.

Over the past year, Wall Street analysts have become increasingly bullish
on Comcast's future, and two have recently upgraded the stock to a "strong
buy" in advance of the company's first-quarter earnings report expected on
May 8. The reason: Two important trends are bullish for the cable TV
industry as a whole, and Comcast is at the forefront of each.

First, cablers are poised to reap the benefits of technological
improvements, including digital video, interactive television, cable modems
and cable telephone service. Second, the industry will finish a series of
very expensive upgrades next year and will then enjoy several years of
lower capital spending. That means that the torrent of cash the cable TV
business generates will be available to companies to reduce debt, buy back
stock, raise dividends, make strategic acquisitions or otherwise increase
shareholder value.

At the current $44 share price, Comcast trades at 18 times next year's
estimated cash flow. That's a fair valuation and could look very cheap a
couple of years from now as Comcast cashes in on its first-rate technology
and enjoys soaring free cash flow.

this a wine to age.

5. NYC Restaurants: Midtown Elegance, One Floor Down
====================================================

New York has noisy chefs and quiet chefs. Geoffrey Zakarian
is one of the quiet ones. But at his restaurant Town, he's
coming perilously close to making some noise, in a quiet
sort of way. (Three stars.)

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Notice # 01-150
May 4, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Amendments to NYMEX End of Week Post-Close Trading Session Rule

DATE:
May 4, 2001
===========================================================

Please be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of
changes to the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule that were
recently approved by the Board will become effective.

Specifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for
subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day
before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in
effect:

(1)  Contract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be
expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract
months.

(2)  The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.57("POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION") AND
NYMEX RULE 6.57A ("END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 6.57A.     END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an
Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close
trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.
Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the "End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five
 (5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the
following conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
[four] * twelve * listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above
the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of
the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Frequently asked questions

Is it bullish if my stock is added to the S&P? Can stock splits and
buybacks increase total returns? What should I do with a spinoff?

By Michael Sivy

Q: Does being included in an index like the Dow or the S&P 500 increase a
stock's returns?

A: Just being in an index doesn't have much long-term effect. But stocks
typically receive a quick boost when they're added to a major index and go
down a little when they're kicked out. That's because many mutual fund
managers tie their performance to the Dow or the S&P 500, leading them to
hold many of the same stocks. As a result, money managers frequently load
up on new additions and dump stocks that are removed.

Q: Are stock splits good for shareholders?

A: Studies confirm that splits are good for share prices. According to one
study, stocks that split two-for-one outperform the market over the
following year by an average of four percentage points. That may not seem
logical, since a split has no fundamental impact on value: You simply get
more shares that are worth proportionately less.

But there are explanations for the outperformance. By reducing the share
price, splits make it easier for small investors to buy 100-share round
lots, boosting demand for the stock. In addition, no company wants to split
its stock and then watch it crash. So a company's top managers aren't
likely to authorize a split unless they are optimistic about the future. Of
course, management confidence means more for blue chips than for start-ups,
which may well disappoint even their own insiders.

Q: How beneficial are stock buybacks?

A: Companies that regularly buy back their own shares can outpace
comparable stocks by as much as three or four percentage points a year, on
average. In simplest terms, buybacks ensure that earnings -- and earning
increases -- are divided among a smaller number of shares. As long as the
cost of the buyback is less than the benefit of shrinking the number of
shares outstanding, earnings per share will rise.

As a result, buybacks are most effective when a company has at least 12
percent annual growth and a P/E below 20. Of course, those are the same
characteristics that conservative growth investors look for (see "Investing
for growth" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001009.html ]). So
you should first choose stocks based on fundamentals, and only count
buybacks as a bonus. Two cautions: Buybacks of high-priced stocks may not
help much. And not all companies that announce buybacks actually follow
through and repurchase shares.

Q: Should you hang on to a spinoff?

A: When a large corporation spins off some of its operations as an
independent firm, the new stock may fall in the first month or so. Reason:
Many existing shareholders who receive a spinoff dump it. Index funds, for
example, won't hold it if it's not in their index. And individual investors
may sell because the company doesn't fit their investing style. Following
the initial dip, however, spinoffs often go on to be stellar performers. In
fact, one study found that spinoffs outperform comparable stocks by as much
as 20 percentage points over the first 18 months.

If you own a stock in a company that is going to grant you shares in a
spinoff, it may be smart to wait at least a year before selling the new
shares. On the other hand, if you aren't a shareholder and the spinoff is a
stock you'd like to own, consider waiting until after the initial dip.

The tech wreck continues

Election chaos and lousy earnings news from companies
such as Hewlett-Packard are driving down tech stocks.
But don't rush to buy yet.

By Michael Sivy

There is no constitutional crisis. The presidential
election results will probably be sorted out within a
week, and certainly long before the electors cast
their votes on Dec. 18. Though the outcome of the
bitter fight in Florida is anybody's guess -- it
largely depends on technical legal issues -- the
lawyers I know think the chances of Al Gore getting
the count he wants are better than 50 - 50.

The electoral chaos is contributing to a decline in
the Dow and an even sharper selloff in the Nasdaq,
which was down to less than 2,900 at one point on
Monday - more than 40 percent off the March high.
Also a large factor in the selloff was Hewlett
Packard's third-quarter bomb. Although sales were up
almost 17 percent from year-earlier levels, earnings
came in 20 percent, or 10 cents a share, below analysts'
expectations. They attribute the profit shortfall
partly to the effects of the weak euro, but mostly to
expenses that were much higher than H-P expected. It
appears that to reach its ambitious sales goals, the
company let costs get out of hand.

 From a long-term perspective, there doesn't seem to
be anything seriously wrong with Hewlett-Packard's
business. With more attention to cost control, H-P's
sales might grow a little bit slower -- 15 percent
annually, say -- but profits would increase just as
fast. Trading at $34 a share, less than 17 times
earnings for the coming year, a sustainable 15
percent earnings growth rate makes H-P look extremely
cheap, and some analysts rate it a value buy. More
skeptical analysts, however, think that H-P's decline
could continue for a while. And that's my bet as
well.

The problem is that the tech group as a whole is in a
powerful downtrend. In fact, the biggest and
best-known tech stocks could be the hardest hit
between now and year end. Usually, money managers and
mutual fund executives try to finish their tax
selling by the end of October. But given the recent
uncertainty, portfolio managers may continue to cut
back on their big tech positions, hurting even such
tech blue-chips as Cisco and Oracle.

Tech stocks aren't the only ones with targets painted
on them. If Gore does gain the presidency, big drug
stocks could react quite negatively. Even though it
will be hard for Gore to do much to hurt the
industry, given the hostile and divided Congress he
would face, the drug stocks have been building in a
big Bush-victory premium over the past few
weeks -- and the group would therefore be susceptible
to a psychologically based selloff.

The investment that would likely profit most from a
Gore victory is fixed-income. He would face a
Republican Congress at least through 2002, and over
the next two years the surplus could total more than
$500 billion. With a sharply divided government, the
vast bulk of this money would go to paying down the
national debt, which could be reduced by 10 percent
to 15 percent over the two-year period. And even if
George W. Bush somehow manages to hang on, the
numbers would be similar.

Paying down the national debt is wildly bullish for
long-term Treasury bonds, and would also help the
bonds of government agencies -- like Ginnie
Mae -- and blue-chip corporations. A shrinking
national debt would likely slow the economy even
more -- it's the opposite of deficit spending after
all. That could contribute to a negative climate for
growth stocks and encourage the Fed to start lowering
interest rates at the first opportunity -- probably
early next year. The case for conservatism and
diversification has never been greater.

Romance in Paradise!

Dear Peter,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called "Sin City" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

The island of Oahu just might be the perfect place for a romantic

vacation here, we're not sure you're ever going to agree on anything. 
She likes seclusion, and you like bustle? No problem. Lively Waikiki 
is complemented by dozens of other beaches on the island, some of 
which you'll have practically to yourselves. Or maybe he's a city

Grupo Taca is Currently Offering Sale Fares to Costa Rica!
Costa Rica, with its unspoiled beaches and abundant wildlife, is 
pretty close to paradise on earth. It's not highly developed--don't

is your idea of the perfect vacation, Costa Rica is the place 
for you.

Dear PETER,

Travelocity's Fare Watcher, your ultimate tool for keeping on top of
rapidly changing air fares, found fare changes in 2 of the markets
you are watching.  When you review the airfares below, remember that
fares change rapidly!  Low fares sell out quickly, and the sooner you
check, the more likely you are to find available seats.

Have your travel needs changed? Are you looking to go someplace new?
Remember to update your Fare Watcher subscription so that you're
always notified when fares change to your favorite destinations.

Subject: Focus Group with traders -- EnronOnline Commercial

As per our conversation today, I am helping Enron's ad agency develop a 
television commercial about EnronOnline.  Their creative team would like to 
meet with a few Enron traders to learn first hand about what traders like, 
dislike, what motivates them, their work environment, etc.  This will help us 
make the commercial more realistic.  Would you or a couple of traders in your 
team be able to attend a focus group next Tuesday, March 21st from 11:45 to 1 
p.m. in the Enron Building? I'll send you the meeting room info. later.  We 
will serve lunch.  Please let me know.  Your input will be very useful in 
creating an effective ad.

Subject: Re: For Sale: Home Office Furniture from Storehouse Furniture



Sorry guys, I was on vacation yesterday.  Here are the photos.  Some of you 
have asked......the furniture is four years old.  My husband and I both work 
outside the home, so it has really just been used to surf the internet and do 
family finances.  It is in great condition.  Come over any evening or weekend 
and see for yourself.  We still like it, but we have to give up our study to 
make room for the twins we are expecting in September!  Mima, I would prefer 
to keep all the pieces together, but I may consider selling the bookcase 
separately, I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

The king of beers

Investors searching for defensive stocks are rediscovering the appeal of a
good brew. Anheuser-Busch looks like the top pick in the group.

By Michael Sivy

When the stock market gets rocky, many investors turn to drink.
Historically, buying shares in brewers has been a good way to play defense
in uncertain times because beer consumption is hardly affected by
fluctuations in economic growth. That hasn't counted for much during the
1990s boom, however. And the brewers have had bigger problems, too --
specifically, growth has gone flat. But that's all changing. A rotation in
stock-market leadership (away from momentum and into value) and shifting
demographics could lead to better times for all the U.S. beer makers and
Anheuser-Busch [BUD], maker of Budweiser, in particular.

Because of their high fixed costs, beer-makers' profits are highly
sensitive to very small changes in volume. And for the past two decades,
sales growth by volume has been terrible. Per-capita consumption is down to
less than a beer a day, a drop of nearly 11 percent since 1980.

No one will be surprised to learn that young adults are the most
enthusiastic beer guzzlers. In fact, though 21-to-27-year-olds account for
only 14 percent of the population, they put away 27 percent of the beer
consumed in the U.S. During the 1990s, the number of Americans in that age
bracket declined from 41 million to 36 million. But over the next few
years, their ranks will rise to around 38 million.

That bodes well for all brewers, but Anheuser-Busch may be best positioned
to capture the growth. As in the movie business and the magazine business,
success in the beer game depends on control of distribution. And
Anheuser-Busch is not only the biggest brewer, it also has the tightest
grip on its wholesalers. Distributors in more than 75 percent of
Anheuser-Busch's markets handle no other domestic beer (in 65 percent they
don't even handle foreign imports), while wholesalers in less than 30
percent in Miller's and Coor's markets are similarly exclusive.

Anheuser-Busch has steadily been improving its profit margins, but the key
to double-digit earnings gains will be the expected upturn in volume
growth. Per-share earnings growth is projected to average 12 percent
annually over the next five years. Combined with a 1.3 percent dividend
yield, the stock should offer a potential return to shareholders of at
least 13 percent. Since March, Anheuser-Busch has nearly doubled to $48 a
share, or 25 times next year's expected earnings. With a P/E almost double
its projected return, Anheuser-Busch isn't cheap, but it's a solid buy for
an investor looking for a top-quality defensive stock. And on any selloff
down to the low $40s, the stock would be a screaming buy.

The ultimate election play

The timely case for Diebold, a leading maker of bank ATMs and high-tech
voting machines. Plus the latest non-events at the Fed and responses to
reader comments.

By Michael Sivy

Dimpled and pregnant though they be, the hanging chads are swinging once
again. Now it looks as though the legal terrain is favoring Bush. I've
written about the consequences to stocks of a Bush victory (see "Election
correction" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001103.html ] ),
and I've considered the implications of a Gore victory (see "The tech wreck
continues" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001113.html ] ). I
want to appear timely, but I'm running out of scenarios (Nader or Buchanan?
That's a bit far-fetched). Still, there may be money to be made on this
mess, and I cast my vote for Diebold, a mid-cap Ohio company.

I last recommended Diebold [DBD], the leading U.S. producer of bank ATM
machines, in early February, when it was trading at $22 a share ("see "Deja
vu") [ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000202.html
]. At the time, the company had just come off a string of bad news: The
Asian financial crisis in 1998 had crimped foreign sales, and Y2K fears
(remember them) hurt sales in the second half of 1999. Plus, all the bank
megamergers, which resulted in many branch closings, cut into domestic
business. Nevertheless, Diebold's earnings have steadily risen, and the
stock is up to $28.75, a 30% gain since February.

Here's the election play: Through its Brazilian subsidiary, Diebold also
makes voting machines. In October, some 100 million Brazilian voters cast
ballots using Diebold terminals, which promise speedy, accurate results and
claim to eliminate confusion (the terminals also come in special versions
for the physically challenged). So when U.S. state and local governments
start rushing to upgrade their voting machines, who could be better
positioned than Diebold? With annual earnings growth projected at 13% over
the next five years and a 2% yield, Diebold trades at 14.5 times this
year's estimated earnings and 12.8 times next year's projected results.

        *       *       *

The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee met today to consider changing
its interest rate policy. The FOMC not only kept rates unchanged, it also
maintained a tightening bias -- that means the Fed is still allowing for
the possibility of raising interest rates. It would do so to fight
inflation, which remains a threat largely because of the tight labor market
(with unemployment below 4%) and the runup in energy prices. But if the
economy continues to slow, Fed-watchers think the FOMC could go to a
neutral stance in December and start cutting rates early next year.

        *       *       *

I have received more e-mail than usual in response to recent columns (my
thanks to everyone who sends stuff in), and I'd like to respond to two
particularly pointed comments.

First, I'd like to clarify my piece from October on stock options (see "The
right way to use stock options"). I do not advocate options trading for
individual investors. I think most people should concentrate on stocks,
bonds and mutual funds and leave options and futures to professional
trading desks. The nature of the market causes options to be consistently
overpriced, so it is generally a bad choice to buy options. That said,
there may be an advantage to selling them. Typically, small investors can
do this most safely by selling call options on stocks they already own when
that boosts their profit potential. But as some readers pointed out, you
can still lose money on such "covered writes" if the stock drops enough.

Second, I am not, as some readers have suggested, a shameless apologist for
the Democratic party. I think investors should consider the market impact
of political developments in as detached a manner as possible. I have,
however, enjoyed telling my colleagues that I am viewed online as a crazed
liberal.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
April 18, 2001

The rebound begins

Greenspan's aggressive rate cutting will fuel a market comeback that should
boost stock prices 20 percent or more over the next 12 months.

By Michael Sivy

For nine months, the economy has been slowing. And most growth stocks have
been dragged down by a brutal decline in tech shares. Through it all,
investors complained that the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates
too high. Well, there's nothing left to complain about. Fed chairman Alan
Greenspan's surprise half-point cut on Wednesday brings interest rates down
to where they should be. And make no mistake about it -- the economy will
begin picking up speed, and the stock market will be substantially higher a
year from now.

Greenspan has been widely criticized for keeping rates high for so long. He
began raising them in early 1999 and continued to keep rates up through the
end of last year. High rates made sense in the first half of 2000, when the
GDP was growing at an annual rate around 5 percent, fast enough to rekindle
inflation. But it was a mistake for Greenspan to continue keeping money
tight after growth slackened to 2.2 percent in the third quarter. Moreover,
even once he began cutting rates in January, he brought them down too slowly.

I believe that Greenspan held up rates for so long because he knows how
tough it is to fight inflation. For political reasons, it's often hard to
increase interest rates. So when the Fed has a chance to give inflation an
extra push down simply by keeping rates up a bit too long, that's the
politically savvy choice. Greenspan even has a term for that ploy -- he
calls it "opportunistic disinflation."

Such a policy was perfectly feasible as long as the economy was expanding
slightly -- and thereby narrowly escaping recession. But capital spending
continued to weaken and mounting stock market losses threatened to undercut
consumer spending. Then when the March employment numbers were announced on
April 6, they showed the first drop in a long time. With employment
weakening -- and unemployment rising -- Greenspan could no longer afford to
keep his foot on the brake. And so, two weeks later he cut rates, laying
the groundwork for a substantial rebound.

I'm not minimizing the risks that still exist. The economy will most likely
be weak for another quarter. And plenty of individual stocks will suffer in
May and June as companies warn of disappointing second-quarter results.
There are also lots of industry-specific problems to worry about. Banks
face rising losses on bad tech loans, telecommuniciations companies could
suffer from overcapacity for at least another 18 months and various tech
firms are still trying to work off excess inventories.

In fact, the current market rally could burn out in a week or two. But I
believe the market has already seen its lows. And if those lows are
re-tested between May and July, I doubt the indexes will go much below
where they've already been.

More important, the prices of big, strong, well-established growth stocks
figure to be substantially higher a year from now. Historically, after the
Fed has cut rates four times in a row, blue chips gain more than 20 percent
over the following year. I think we're looking at those kinds of gains
again. Tech stocks will rally, but so will other glamour growth stocks,
including entertainment shares and top retailers.

I've already mentioned in this column that I jumped the gun by loading up
on tech indexes in January and February, and then running up 15 percent to
20 percent losses in March as the sector suffered its final drop. Well,
after today I'm almost even, so I plan on buying myself a really good
brandy after dinner this evening. And whatever the ups and downs of the
next few months, I expect to be feeling even better come next April.

Dale,

To follow up on our conversation, our only problem is in the short 
description. We would like to make in simpler. 

Possibly  reading  " Gas Daily Index" as the product type

Also it seems that the long description in product manager  that we approve 
while  copying  a product does not match the long description after the 
product is created ???

Pete

Updating the Sivy 100

Out goes Allstate, AMR, Bank One and Honeywell. The new members are
Comcast, EDS, MBNA and Motorola.

By Michael Sivy

I like to update the Sivy 100 [ www.money.com/money/sivy100/ ] at regular
intervals, and given the market turmoil of recent months, some changes are
surely in order. That said, readers shouldn't rush to buy new additions,
nor should they necessarily sell the stocks I'm replacing. The Sivy 100 is
intended to be a source for top-quality growth stocks that belong in a
well-balanced stock portfolio. But the decision to buy or sell should also
reflect price levels and the near-term market outlook.

Far and away the most important recent development for the overall market
is that analysts have become increasingly worried about the potential for a
serious economic slowdown next
year -- conceivably even a recession. As a result, earnings growth
projections have come down across the board and otherwise solid companies
in slower-growing industries have slipped below my 12 percent cutoff for
projected total return.

In a sense, the downward revisions by analysts are meaningless. The folks
in Bally tasseled loafers didn't cut their numbers until after many
companies had already warned that future earnings would fall short. So why
didn't they tell us that six months ago? Moreover, the long-term earnings
growth potential for some stocks has arguably gone up slightly, since
future profits will be compared with weak numbers for the current year.

As a result, I haven't kicked stocks off the list simply because analysts
have temporarily cut their projections to a little below 12 percent. The
ones I've replaced no longer have the long-term growth prospects I look for.

Allstate [ALL], for example, is cutting costs and broadening its business
in positive ways. But its growth prospects have fallen far below my cutoff,
largely because of weakness in insurance pricing and losses due to
unusually bad weather. (Though its growth prospects are sub-par, many
analysts still like Allstate as a value play with a price-to-earnings ratio
of14.)

AMR [AMR], the parent of American Airlines, faces an uncertain future. The
March spin-off of its SABRE reservation system muddies year-over-year
comparisons. High jet-fuel prices and the possibility of a
recession-induced drop in business traffic further cloud prospects.

Bank One [ONE] is suffering in a more difficult banking environment and
needs to complete a complicated restructuring and cost-reduction plan. As a
result, the company's growth prospects don't look as attractive as those of
some competitors.

Finally, Honeywell International [HON] will almost certainly be taken over
by General Electric within the next few months, so it will disappear from
our list in any event before too long.

I try to make sure that the Sivy 100 includes as diversified an assortment
of industries as possible. But obviously, some industries have better
long-term growth prospects than others. So as projections become less
generous overall, there's a natural shift away from old-line businesses to
higher-growth stocks.

Since I've written a lot about Comcast [CMCSK] and Motorola [MOT], they're
natural additions to the list. Among other stocks that passed our latest
screens, Electronic Data Systems [EDS] is the most attractive, with
projected growth of 15 percent a year and 21 P/E. And MBNA [KRB], a major
credit-card issuer, looks like a sound choice to replace Bank One.

NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of game 5 of the World
Series.  The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of
the Major League Players Union.

"We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers," said the Mets
batting coach. "We were confused by the irregularities of the pitches we
received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls.  It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches.

Reporters at the press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively
reviewed film of the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in
fact faced the Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year.  "The fact
remains that some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to
hit," said the Mets batting coach.

"The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are celebrating
prematurely."  Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of all the
World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the umpires
of each game.  "While some of the strikes called against the Mets were, in
fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of the
World Series," the commissioner said.

Another portion of the Mets legal claim stated that, based on on-base
percentage, the Mets had actually won the World Series, regardless of the
final scores of the games.  "It's clear that we were slightly on-base more
often than the Yankees," said a Mets spokesman.  "The World Series crown is
rightly ours."

The manager of the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some
light jogging for exercise. He has stated that he believes "we need to let
the process run its course without a rush to judgment."

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Subject: Focus Group with traders -- EnronOnline Commercial

As per our conversation today, I am helping Enron's ad agency develop a 
television commercial about EnronOnline.  Their creative team would like to 
meet with a few Enron traders to learn first hand about what traders like, 
dislike, what motivates them, their work environment, etc.  This will help us 
make the commercial more realistic.  Would you or a couple of traders in your 
team be able to attend a focus group next Tuesday, March 21st from 11:45 to 1 
p.m. in the Enron Building? I'll send you the meeting room info. later.  We 
will serve lunch.  Please let me know.  Your input will be very useful in 
creating an effective ad.

All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm)

DATE:
April 19, 2001

===========================================================

Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number
of rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the
implementation of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with
the CFTC and thus may become effective at any time, will be implemented
upon the launch of enymexK.

An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange's
website.  A hard copy "black-line" version of the rule changes, which shows
changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson
at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange's Legal Department.

The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,
accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and
a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access.

     Trading Rules
A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the
roll-out of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX
ACCESS7 and enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has
been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system.

EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange's rules that
respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded
only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules
will now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions.

Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E ("enymexK Settlement Price
Procedures") was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for
electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement
prices generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee,
or if the Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using
the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However,
one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no
settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid
or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)
contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available
for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By
comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would
allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and
offers that would be protected in the settlement!
 process.

Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four
physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX
Rules 9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months
and a spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.
Also, the Exchange's current hedge exemption procedures will be made
applicable to the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled
enymexK contracts, the rule amendments provide for position accountability
across all contract months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a
reporting level of 25 contracts for each enymexK contract, the same
reporting level currently used for many other Exchange contracts. However,
NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding
possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these
reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cash-settled contracts.

Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage,
new Rule 9.04A ("enymexK Trading") permits brokerage to be done for enymexK
products.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member
will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it
carries, even if there is a system malfunction.

     Arbitration Rules
The Exchange's arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Member
enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a
Non-Member enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be
subject to Exchange arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory
basis.

     Summary Disciplinary Procedures
The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member
enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system.
Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a
summary disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action
when necessary on an expedited basis.

Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue
to be subject to Exchange rules.

If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact
Christopher K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX
Legal Department, at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate
General Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207.

Electroshock in California

As the electricity shortage in the Golden State reaches a crisis, local
utilities are getting badly squeezed. But independent power producers are
having a field day.

By Michael Sivy

The craziness in Florida has overshadowed an even more bizarre story
unfolding in California. The Golden State is running out of electricity and
on Thursday declared an unprecedented "Stage Three" alert. To conserve
power, emergency measures are being considered that would ordinarily be
unthinkable. Pumps that move water from Northern to Southern California may
be idled for part of the day. Older generating plants may be allowed to run
at levels that cause excess air pollution. Extra water may be diverted
through hydroelectric dams endangering rare salmon. And it's possible that
residents won't be able to turn on their Christmas lights until after 7:30 
p.m.

California has been forced to contemplate such appalling measures because
of a hopelessly bungled electricity deregulation scheme begun in 1998. At
the time, experts predicted that competition could eventually cut
electricity costs by as much as 30 percent. To help California utilities
bolster their financial strength for the new competitive market, consumer
prices were left partially fixed until 2002, while wholesale costs were
allowed to seek market levels.

Since surplus power could be bought fairly cheaply, California electric
companies initially profited. But unfavorable weather boosted the demand
for electricity, while higher oil and gas prices increased costs for
suppliers. Prices for out-of-state power have soared: For example, the
cheapest surplus Canadian power that used to go for as little as $10 per
megawatt-hour recently hit $1,000 during periods of peak demand.

It's all been a catastrophe for California electric companies, which have
to pay market prices for power but are limited as to how much they can
charge consumers. The big utilities most affected are Edison International,
parent of Southern California Edison, and PG&E, parent of Pacific Gas &
Electric. Both stocks are down more than 25 percent from their highs.

But not all energy companies are suffering. One big beneficiary of this
mess is Duke Energy [DUK]. In addition to traditional power operations in
the Carolinas, Duke has an unregulated wholesale-energy subsidiary that
does extensive business in California and recently signed electricity
contracts with both Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.
The subsidiary is also expanding and modernizing its California plants.
Those additions will account for a sizable chunk of the new generating
capacity expected to come on line over the next two years.

Duke has long been one of my favorite utilities. I recommended the stock in
May and again in July at $62 a share (see "Power companies" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000510.html ] and
"True value" [
http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000728.html ]).
Since then, the share price has risen 38 percent to $85.75. With projected
earnings growth of 9.5 percent annually over the next five years and a 2.5
percent dividend yield, the stock offers a potential total return of 12
percent a year. At 19 times next year's estimated earnings, the stock looks
pricey for a utility, but the company certainly has a fantastic position.
I'd hang on to any that I already owned and buy more on any dips.

Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the
closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted
the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the
close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible
to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above,
the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an
expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the
following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded
during a post-close session (on any day of the week):

1.   Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading
in the post-close.

2.   If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session,
it may not be traded during the post-close.

3.   It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in
order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the
RTH session.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Romance in Paradise!

Dear Peter,

Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called "Sin City" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us.

is complemented by dozens of other beaches on the island, some of 
which you'll have practically to yourselves. Or maybe he's a city
