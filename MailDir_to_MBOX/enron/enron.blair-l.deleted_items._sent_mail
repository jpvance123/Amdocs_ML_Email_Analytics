Subject:	Update NNG Doc System by Tuesday, June 19th


The NNG Doc System is now open and  ready for your updates on OBA imbalances.  Please input your updates before Tuesday, June 19th, 5pm.

The reason for the short timeframe is due to the WINDOWS 2000 upgrades on the nights of June 19 & 20 and the unavailability of the DOC system during this time.

Please see me if you have any questions.


Larry

Rick, if you have some time on Tuesday, I would like to visit with you
about this.  I don't want this move to be any more negative than what
it is.  I have a possible game plan I would like to talk with you about
and then maybe you and I need to take Larry and Raetta to lunch
give them a chance to talk and then let them know our next steps.
Glad you are back.  Lynn

Here is the email I sent Lynn regarding having Raetta and I on a different floor than the NNG MS Reps.   Again, I am very AGAINST having Raetta and I seperated from the NNG MS reps on a different floor. It will create confusion and be a disruption to our jobs.

See me if you have any questions.

Subject:	Concerns 

Lynn,

I wanted to express my concerns of having Raetta and I located on another floor, away from the NNG teams.  Raetta and I deal with the MS Reps daily on the following items:

*Approving all Journal Vouchers and Wire transfer requests
*Questions from all NNG reps concerning rates on invoices, volume allocations, imbalances, accounts receivables, etc.
*Sitting in on conference calls with the reps and customers (or marketers) concerning invoices, imbalances, accounts receivable, etc
*Meeting with you every morning and through the day on various customer issues and questions


During the Reservation close cycle (approximately 6 work days), Raetta and I need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting
*Distribution of the South Region Flash report (Craig Buehler's report) and reviewing it

During the Commodity PPA close cycle (approximately 5 work days), we would need to be on same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary transportation, penalty and imbalances invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS and GVA error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them

During the current month Commodity close cycle (approximately 4 work days), we would need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting

The total number of days I have just listed are 15 work days. The maximum number of work days a month totals at 22.  Therefore, approximately 3 weeks out of the month, Raetta and I would have to be on the floor daily.  In this totals, I am NOT including the 3 work days it takes me to meet with reps on NNG OBA imbalances to gather and analyze information for the Customer Accounts meeting.

As you can see, it is very important for Raetta and myself to remain on the floor with the MS reps.  See me if you need further details.

Larry

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

We know that many of you have been severely impacted by Tropical Storm Allison and the devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. 

To assist you, Enron is providing employees and contractors who have had their houses damaged with $1000 in travelers checks. To receive the checks, please come by EB1625 after 12 noon tomorrow, June 13.   Please be patient as we may temporarily run out of checks depending on the demand.

Please know that the paycheck you will receive on June 30th will be grossed up to account for the taxes that will be taken out if you are an employee. Also please know that you will be asked to sign a certification of your situation in order to receive the funds.

We hope that this helps you and your family. Our thoughts are with you.

Please call Misha Siegel at x37682 should you have any questions.

I assumed Kaztex were nominating on the timely, but after our storage discussions at today's Morning Meeting, I need to check.  I will instruct them to do so.  This should then clear up their accounts. 

Thanks!

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not any NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Storage on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get injections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few days.

Sue

Subject:	IDD/Park & Ride Transfer

Earlier this month, Marketing entered into a negotiated rate deal with Kaztex for one day transport from Demarc to Eagle.  It was Kaztex's intention to withdraw the gas they had in their IDD/Park & Ride account to bring their balance down to zero.  The negotiated rate deal required extensive review and the customer was tendered the contract at 11:52 AM.  Market Services held open the window to accomodate their late nomination.

Herein lies the problem, the Kaztex scheduler withdrew the Park & Ride from the Demarc Storage Point because Demarc was their Primary Receipt Point on the transportat contract.   Instead, they should have withdrew from their Ogden and Mid 17 Storage balances.  To date, they have tried to nominate a transport from the Mid 17 and Ogden points to Demarc Storage but the Storage Nominations continue to be allocated.

I understand it is not Northern's policy to transfer storage between two points without a transportation transaction, however, I would request for this specific case Northern would administer a transfer thus preventing any possible MIC charges at the end of the month.  I estimate the transport revenue being waived to be approx. $44 (2345 MMBtu from Mid 17 Storage * $0.019 plus 720 MMBtu from Ogden at $0 cost).  The negotiated rate deal easily made up this amount.

If you agree with allowing the transfer of the storage balances, please let me know and I will alert the appropriate scheduler and Kaztex.

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject:	RE: Modification to the new daily SCADA Report

Here are the stored procedures with their parameters in parenthesis.  Most of them are single selects and could be incorporated into SQL in the Excel add-in if desired.  I thought stored procedures would make it easier to separate support for the add-in from support for the code.  The stored procedures are all on the server ETSADHOC, database adhoctest, under my id (dpowell).  I think we want to get the DBA's to move these into a production environment so they are protected (ie: dbo in the etsadhoc database)?

have to change their location or POI number for nomination purposes?  If so,
how did we communicate to the shippers.  How does this effect OBA's?

TW is looking into having a couple of customer meetings, Management needs a list of schedulers for the customers that will be invited. There will probably be a West meeting and a meeting in Houston so they will be done geographically. I am providing the TW Christmas card list as a place to start, so add any new customers and make sure you include the Schedulers names.
I need this by Friday June 15th 4pm.

Mary, as you requested, on yesterday  I have added January 1998 thru May 1998 affidavit volumes.
I have also made adjustments to June and July 1998 volumes.  I didn't multiply the volumes by
the correct number of days for these two months.  If you have any questions or concerns please 
feel free to give me a call.

It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully)
surgery last Monday, June 18th.  Everything went well.  I should be back to
work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the
flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure
ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital
(Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the
Medthodist and Herman hospitals.  

Hope all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have
more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people
starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.

I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that.
Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch
with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with
his Mom.  

Speaking of parents, how are yours?  Hope they are both doing well.

As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.

Take care of each other.  We sure miss you both.  Lynn

Ava & Alma, since I don't know what day's I will be in the office, I have decided to let the two of you set the date on the UPS on-line training.

There is a catch,,,,,,,,, if I miss the overview, you will have to train me....

Ava, would you please reply to Lewis and Verna and let them know what is convenient for you, since you have Reservation Invoices going out next week.

Thank you,

Ava,
A conference room will not be necessary. You will only need a computer
w/Internet access. 
Anthony Burgs (UPS), Mike Boyd (UPS) and Glenn Lewis (Enron) will be there
to walk you through the transition.  Mike will transfer all your files for
you and set up w/the UPS software (WorldShip). Let me know if you have any
questions.

Subject:	Re: Western Gas Resources   

The shippers behind Gomez have been going to WGR since Jan. 1, 2001 and the shippers at Mitchell CO2 have been aware of the pending sell of NNG assets to WGR since at least Jan. 1, 2001.  All of this gas is going to WGR and none of it returns to NNG.  So this was communicated last year when all this was being planned.

The OBA was not affected with this sell.  The OBA with WGR is one OBA that totalled all points.  They owe us 107,000 dth at the end of last month and we owe them 36,000 dth for fuel usage on the #5 unit at Gomez for the first five months of the year.  All that will be left on WGR's OBA will be Benedum and Midkiff.  Dan Ball and I are working together and hope to have the OBA near zero by the end of July.

I hope this answers your questions, if not let me know.

Randy

I found your name on the site, I'm guessing you might be the best person to
lob this question towards...

I'm looking at operational capacity on this site
http://www.tw.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap.html
And I can input the gas day, for today or tomorrow.  But when I get results
back it is ambiguous as to which cycle the gas is flowing in.  Are they all
for the timely cycle or are the evening and intraday cycles thrown in there
as well.  And if they are thrown in there, do I just have to know WHEN the
different cycles are posted and use that as my guide (IE if I'm looking at
results around 14:00 those would be for intraday1 cycle)????

Are you even the person I should ask?

Thanks,

Subject:	Transwestern Invoicing

I have attached a spreadsheet that Elizabeth put together for us for our February invoicing so you can get an idea of the categories and the number of invoices.

These are the 7 categories Elizabeth checks, and how they can be redistributed:

Void Invoices: There are only two of these invoices each month, MSR's can check these, but Marketing will have to communicate when there are additional Invoices that need to be voided.
Delete Line Items: This can also be checked by MSR's but new contracts with these exceptions need to be explained by Marketing to the corresponding MSR for that customer
Volume Adjust: These are also only for exceptional contracts, MSR's can check these exceptions, but Marketing will have to explain exceptions on New Contracts to the corresponding MSR for that customer.
Make-up Volume: MSR's
Adjust Reservation Invoices for change in Credit for Commodity due to make-up: MSR's
Adjust Rate: Marketing
Regenerate Invoice: MSR's

 

We will start checking these for May Accounting,
The TW Team

I am fine with this schedule.  I am a little concerned about Lynda testing because
of Galen being out and the team shortage.  Should we have a back up to Lynda
if she cannot get away from the day to day so we do not loose any time on the
testing.  Just a thought.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn and John
Just to let you know, I have spoke to both Kathy and Lynda regarding the upcoming testing. They have both agreed to assist when their schedules permited. I explained this to Ramona and she said that would be Ok at this point and time. They may require more assistance as this is a large project and needs to go into production on the 15th of July. Please let me know if you are OK with this. Thank you.

Lynn,

As you know, the IT team has been working on the small talk upgrade code changes over the past few months & it has been mved into model office this week for testing. This upgrade is a fairly large change for TMS and will require us to test all screens, functions. Icons, and process which includes approximately 100 screens/reports/processes for each of the pipes. Our deadline to complete this is 7/15/01. If possible, we would like to to ask for both Kathy Washington and Lynda Laferla to assist  us in the testing.  Please let me know if that would be possible.

Thanks Again for your help !
Ramona

An update on our change for the Storage Allocation.  Several questions
have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the
questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message
to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with
storage and determine what changes need to be made.

One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to
be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are
allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating
withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will
pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. Lynn

FYI.  Just to keep ya'll in the loop.  This fix should be ready for test on Monday
and migrated Monday night for Tuesday's use.  This fix will be very beneficial
in minimizing Shipper imbalances on NNG.  Terry and Gerry will work with the teams
to be sure everyone is up to speed on the change.  If you have any questions while I
am out next week, please check with Terry Kowalke or Mike Bodnar.   Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	FW: Storage allocations

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Subject:	Storage allocations

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

Subject:	Customer Scheduler List Needed

TW is looking into having a couple of customer meetings, Management needs a list of schedulers for the customers that will be invited. There will probably be a West meeting and a meeting in Houston so they will be done geographically. I am providing the TW Christmas card list as a place to start, so add any new customers and make sure you include the Schedulers names.
I need this by Friday June 15th 4pm.

 

Thanks: John Buchanan

Estalee, based on the last meetings we had on PRC, what is your
suggestion on how to handle this?  We need to discuss.  I will be back in
the office on Tuesday.  Do you have any time?  Thanks. Lynn

I can remove the performance plan from her Phfile immediately.  Through the PRC process they should have given feedback to support this and therefore her rating should reflect their feedback.

The South Central Team has discussed Debra's Corrective Action Report and feel that she has met the demands we placed on her at the time the report was issued.  We have seen Debra work hard to get up to speed on our various interconnects and other procedures this year.  Debra has sharpened her focus on our business, gained competence in all areas requested, and is now able to support the team when needed.  We therefore request that this report be removed from her file. 

 Please let me know if anything more is needed to complete this updating for Debra. 

Thank you,

Janet McDaniel for the South Central Team

Just wanted to check in with you.  Hopefully by today you're feeling pretty good.  Be glad when you get back.  You know I'm stuck here with kids, what a way to start off the morning.  Just rolling along with my new Windows 2000/Outlook, takes some getting used to but we always adapt.  Get some rest and get back here!

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.  This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease # 71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.  

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.  Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.

Thanks

Charlie
