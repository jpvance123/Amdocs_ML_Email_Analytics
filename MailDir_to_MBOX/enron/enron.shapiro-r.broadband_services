I have a conference call w/ Jim Fallon on Wednesday and w/ Paul Racicot, Tuesday afternoon (4 p.m. c.d.t.)

I wanted to touch base w/ you on a few issues, before I speak to Jim.  Talk to you tomorrow.

1.  My plan at this point is to continue activity through the end of 2001, assuming no continued funding in 2002.
2.  Need to discuss a graceful exit strategy in DC with legislators and FCC.  (Not sure if there are any plans for any news release relative to EBS, but would want to coordinate a release with meetings in DC)
3.  Continuing to monitor legislation (including Economic Stimulus Bill (Upton Bill)) which includes accelerated depreciation of investments and tax credits for new investment.  Currently doesn't include anything on unbundling, a la Tauzin-Dingel, but we continue to monitor.
4.  Low likelihood of other legislation being passed out of Congress this year dealing with telecom.  We have been laying low in our coalition efforts with other Houston energy companies (i.e. El Paso and Dynegy).
5.  Venable, a law firm in DC, that is representing Verizon, is interested in Enron's participation in its coalition.  We haven't been able to find common ground on issues.  However, last approach indicated that Verizon views Enron's participation as having cache.  I would suggest approaching commercial folks to see if they think they can utilize the leverage of us joining the coalition in exchange for some commercial deal w/ Verizon.  Probably a long-shot, but maybe worth a look.  Problem here is Venable wants to use Enron's name in a public way around DC with lawmakers.  If we have exiting on our minds, doesn't make sense to make a big splash.  
6.  SBC has filed for non-dominant status at the FCC for provision of advanced services.  Has the effect of removing SBC from regulatory oversight.  We are seeing what Comptel is doing and determining whether we will join in with their filing or file separately.
7.  Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) appears to be a new RBOC organization, filed a letter to the Bush Administration asking that access to advanced services not be provided to competitors on an unbundled basis.  Steve Burns has already met w/ Nancy Victory, Telecom Expert for the Administration, giving her the other side of the story.  This is another way of trying to get the Administration to weigh in on the issue.
8. 271 applications-3 BellSouth States (MS, LA, GA) have received state 271 authority, pending FCC review.  SBC has two application pending FCC review (AK and MO).  Qwest has announced its intent to file 7 or 8 applications by end of 1Q02.  We are not active at the state level.
9.  Interconnection agreements.  Hope to have majority of the agreements ready to file by November 01.  A few agreements, CO and NV, may take longer.

Thanks.

Mona

Jim,

I am leaving a binder of material for you with Lucy that includes all of the 
correspondence to date with Verizon.  While you should not feel obliged to 
read all of it by any means, I have tabbed several summaries of meetings or 
calls that we had which might give you a better idea of how obstructive 
Verizon has been thus far; to that extent, I have highlighted certain 
passages as well.  However, I would encourage you to read the June 14th 
letter that we sent to Jeff Masoner (VP of Interconnection Services of 
Verizon Services Corp.) as it provides a general summary of our 
correspondence with Verizon.  The letter is included in the binder.

The critical issues for us are as follows:

1. Verizon has not provided an answer as to whether it will provide terms, 
conditions and prices for OC-3, 12 and 48 loops and OC-48 transport for 
inclusion in an interconnection agreement or supplemental agreement/amendment.

2. Verizon has not provided us with the relevant loop and transport rates for 
the seven states where we seek interconnection (MA, NJ, NY, DC, VA, PA and 
CA).  We sent them specific information regarding central office locations, 
CLLI codes, and mileage for the 7 states, however, in response to their 
request for this information in order to provide us with corresponding rates.

In addition, nobody from Verizon has responded to the letter that we sent to 
Jeff Masoner, nor have any of the deadlines that were set forth in the letter 
been met (e.g., answer inquiry #1 above by June 20th; answer inquiry #2 by 
July 11th).  Please note that there are other issues that still need to be 
discussed and resolved, and a list of those questions is included in the 
binder.  It is my hope that, in the course of mediation, the NY Commission 
would assist us with negotiating all of our issues.

I have asked Lucy to schedule a call for you with Paul Lacouture (President, 
Network Services Group, Verizon Communications) to occur on Monday, July 
16th.  She is in the process of doing so.  Paul Racicot, Stewart Seeligson, 
and Frank Bay are aware of our desire to file for mediation with the NY 
Commission subsequent to your call with Lacouture;  Sue and I will be 
discussing this with Everett on Friday morning.

If you have any additional questions, please let me know.  Although I will be 
traveling, I will check messages and my cell number is 713-851-7770 if you 
need to reach me.  Thank you for your assistance.

Regards,
Lara

Rick,

FYI.  I was asked to put this together for Jim Fallon by Scott Manuel, Frank McGuiness and Rus Woody.  I am providing the same analysis to Kay Mann, et. al., for purposes of PROJECT THUNDERDOME.  This is a strategic reassessment of where new EBS businesses should reside relative to existing (i.e. content and network).  I am happy to give you a briefing on this if you desire.  I have schedule time to discuss with you next week.  Thanks.

Mona

Rick and Linda,

Scott and I met yesterday with Rich DiMichele of EBS.  Rich is a Managing 
Director who recently has assumed responsibility for content delivery 
services, including the Blockbuster deal.

Rich is very intent on getting access to the cable platform as quickly as 
possible.  (Initially this would be primarily for delivering Blockbuster to 
more homes.  Within the year, he hopes to be able to offer services in 
addition to Blockbuster).

Scott and I prepared the attached cable open access proposal, which we gave 
to Rich yesterday.  (We had hoped to circulate this to you before giving it 
to Rich, but the timing didn't work out as initially planned.  Sorry about 
that).  Could you take a look and let us know if you have additional comments 
on the approach we have suggested?  Also, we are looking for recommendations 
on top tier law firms for cable issues.  We would be available to meet with 
them next week when we are in DC.

Thanks,

Sue

I've been invited to speak next Friday at a Southern Gas Association 
conference.  I'm the speaker during a "Pipeline Right-of-Way Round Table" 
session.
The chair of the session from El Paso natural gas heard me speak last 
December here in Washington on the fiber optic federal lands ROW issue, and 
invited me to talk to the pipeline folks on how the fiber ROW fight will 
affect pipelines.
Attached is my proposed presentation -- I remember you asking some time ago 
to see any presentations we propose to make.
Approved?

Thanks,
Steve

The attached e-mail was sent to the Venable Law Group, who is representing Verizon, expressing the lack of interest by Enron in joining Venable's coalition.  The coalition was intended to be used by Venable to demonstrate support for Verizon's legislative agenda, which, in short, is that access to and pricing of fiber will be on an unregulated basis, outside of FCC or state jurisdiction.  This is another short-hand way of getting back to Tauzin-Dingel language.  We told Venable we weren't interested.  

I spoke w/ Rich DiMichele about the possibility of using Verizon's interest in our coalition support to negotiate something commercially for Enron.  He expressed the sentiment contained in the e-mail:  Verizon has done nothing for us.  Why should we do something for them? 

Venable has come back with a request for a meeting between their senior executives and ours.

Before I go back to the business people with Venable's offer, I thought we should discuss, possibly on Tuesday.

Bill:

The offer to join the Broadband Deployment Initiative has been considered by our senior management.  

Unfortunately, we haven't witnessed any "goodwill" from Verizon to date in our attempts to strike commercial deals.  Unless Verizon were willing to change that, we see no compelling value to joining this coalition, which would lend Enron's name value to an RBOC policy initiative.

Obviously, joining a coalition is only worthwhile if there is a win-win for its members.  At this time, we don't see the value to Enron.  If Verizon can demonstrate that value, in a commercially relevant way, the we would consider re-evaluating our position.

Steve Burns

Just a quick overview of observations/conversations from the South Sound 
Technology Conference in Tacoma yesterday.  The conference was a regional 
gathering on Puget Sound area leaders, telecom/tech, and educators.  Notable 
participants were Rep. Adam Smith, Sen. Cantwell, and Gov. Locke.  Rep. Norm 
Dicks' office was there but he was on a defense trip to Europe.  

Statements from Maria Cantwell:  
She hoped the change in the Senate will change the direction of the Bush 
Energy plan and she endorsed the Feinstein/Smith price cap legislation as 
much needed relief for the Northwest.  
She described her support for competition in the telecom industry.  (while 
not specific, it was a reference to Tauzin/Dingell which she didn't seem 
supportive of).
She endorsed S.88, the Sen. Rockefeller bill to create tax incentives for 
broadband deployment.

I didn't get any time with Sen. Cantwell, but I did spend some time with 
Stacy Baird, her LD and her Chief of Staff (whose name escapes me at the 
moment).  I followed up with Stacy on our conversation last week in DC and he 
told me that he was interested in EBS' thoughts on telecom issues going 
forward after Tauzin/Dingell fades.

Statements from Gov. Locke:
Gov. Locke wanted the state to do a better job reaching out to area 
businesses and encouraged more public/private parnerships.  He gave the 
example of too many streets being ripped up for fiber and that the state 
should provide more leadership in managing infrastructure development.
The energy situation will be a critical factor in tech growth in WA.  He 
stated that some high-tech companies are threatening to leave Silicon Valley 
because of the energy crises and that WA may find itself in a similar 
position. 

Unfortunately I didn't get an opportunity to speak with Locke after his 
remarks. 

Statements from Rep. Adam Smith
He pretty much echoed Locke's concern that energy supply and prices may cause 
the region to lose jobs.  
He supported Tauzin/Dingell stating that he didn't think most people 
understood the "seriousness" of broadband infrastructure issues.  He seemed 
to believe that the RBOCs are the only hope for immediate DSL roll-out.

I spoke with Rep. Smith for about 10 minutes, mostly about telecom 
competition.  He mentioned that he had spoken to "Enron's DC people" about 
energy, but I was unable to ascertain if it was a positive dialogue or not.  
On telecom competition he had much the same perspective as Rep. Boucher last 
week (RBOCs need to invest in new facilities free of competitors), but 
recognized the point that the RBOCs should not be rewarded for years of 
foot-dragging after the Telecom Act.  

I also made a good contact w/ Rep. Dicks' district director who wants to 
follow up on telecom infrastructure/trading issues.

MEDIA:

I was approached by to reprters, TV and print, to discuss energy, Gov. Davis, 
and his meeting w/ Pres. Bush.  I declined and directed them to Karen Denne.l


Takeaways:

The conference was a good opportunity to get our message out - I was able to 
talk about the benefits of bandwidth trading AND the need to open the cable 
monopoly,
I made some good contacts with Qwest, Terrabeam (laser last-mile company), 
and the WA Software Alliance (Lew McMurran, their director of public affairs 
mentioned he knew and worked with Paul Kaufman).
Energy is a HUGE issue in the tech community and it was never far from the 
discussion.  I was asked on the panel, "If Enron is advocating a new 
commodity structure for telecom like it did for electricity, can we expect 
CA-like problems in the future?"  I think I answered it well, but I think we 
will find it tougher to separate out businesses/messages in the future.  

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Scott

Here's a great summary memo from our friends at Wolf, Block.   (One note, 
however.  The memo indicates that dark fiber is in some instances regulated 
by the states.  Further discussion revealed that this is true only in a 
limited number of instances in North Carolina).

		 Subject: Good news on BLM/Forest Service right-of-way issue


This language is in the 2002 Senate Interior Appropriations Bill, which was 
debated and passed moments ago.

   Following concern prompting Congressional action last year, the      
   Committee applauds the commitment by the Secretary of the Interior and  
   the Secretary of Agriculture to consult with Congress prior to          
   initiating any attempt to amend or revise the linear right-of-way rental
   fee schedule published on July 8, 1987 (43 CFR 2803.1 2(c)(1)(I)).      

In consulting with Senate appropriations staff, we agreed that we didn't want 
to hit the agencies the same way we did last year, when we used control of 
the pursestrings to prevent the BLM and Forest Service from "implementing any 
final rules".  

In fact, there's another good reason to have backed off from an 
appropriations-only tactic: we're close to introducing authorizing language 
in the House that will fix the "fair market value" definitional problem that 
underlies all of this once and for all.

Instead, this approps language puts any agency activity squarely under 
Congressional scrutiny, which you'll recall was not the case last year when 
the agencies attempted to change the interpretation of ROW regs outside of 
even a rulemaking process.

We'll now have the same strategy that we did at this time last year -- defend 
this in conference.  And we'll continue separately to push our authorizing 
language to fix the problem, as well as closely monitor the collection of 
market data and any other signs of mischief by the agencies.

MISSISSIPPI -- BellSouth to file market-entry bid with FCC

BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., yesterday notified the Public 
Service Commission it plans to file an application to provide in-
region interLATA (local access and transport area) services with 
the FCC "on or after" Sept. 19.
 
In November 1998 the PSC concluded BellSouth had met the local 
exchange market-opening mandates in section 271 of the federal 
Telecommunications Act of 1996.  BellSouth yesterday submitted 
third-party test results of its Georgia operation support system 
and proposed performance-measurement and penalty plans.  
BellSouth asked the PSC to reaffirm that it has met the Act's 
market-opening requirements.

Compliance with section 271's 14-point "competitive checklist" is 
a prerequisite for FCC authorization to provide in-region 
interLATA service.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department 
of Justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on the

FLORIDA -- Broward County repeals 'open-access' requirement

Broward County, Fla.'s County Commission yesterday voted to 
repeal an ordinance that had required cable TV franchisees to 
offer unaffiliated Internet service providers "open access" to 
their cable modem platforms.  The vote puts the final nail in the 
coffin for one of the earliest open-access initiatives.

In 1999, Broward became the second county in the U.S. to adopt an 
open-access requirement following the lead of authorities in the 
Portland, Ore., area.  (7/14/99)  A federal district judge in 
Miami, however, ruled last year that Broward's ordinance violated 
cable TV companies' rights to free speech and expression.  In 
"Comcast Cablevision of Broward County et al. v. Broward County" 
(case no. 99-6934-Civ), Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks was the 
first to rely on the First Amendment in nixing a locality's open-
access ordinance.

While the county's appeal of that ruling was pending before the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (Atlanta), the cable 
TV companies filed a claim seeking attorneys' fees from the 
county, said Terry Bienstock, a Miami attorney with The Bienstock 
Law Firm, P.A., who represented the cable TV companies.

Both sides agreed to a settlement under which the parties would 
drop their legal claims if the board voted to repeal the 
ordinance, Anitra Lanczi, Broward's assistant county attorney, 
told TR.  That agreement prompted yesterday's vote, she said.

CALIFORNIA -- Pacific Bell to report on CLEC operational issues

Public Utilities Commissioner Geoffrey Brown has directed Pacific 
Bell to file by May 29 an updated list of operational problems 
recently raised by competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs).  
On April 4-5 Mr. Brown convened a hearing to examine more than 50 
systematic operational problems the CLECs had identified 
concerning ordering, provisioning, post-provisioning, and 
multifaceted issues.

During the hearings and the following six days, Pacific Bell and 
the CLECs met to resolve as many issues as possible.  During an 
April 12 hearing, Pacific Bell presented a status report, which 
set task-completion dates for certain outstanding issues.  

Mr. Brown said he wanted Pacific Bell to update the summary 
regularly to allow the staff to monitor the progress.  The May 29 
summary will identify which issues have been resolved and 
highlight issues affecting more than one CLEC.  Comments on the 
summary will be due June 11.  The staff will compile a final 
summary of the issues by June 21.  

After June 21, and until further notice, Pacific Bell must submit 
a monthly updated issues/action log highlighting the issues that 
were listed in the staff's June 21 final summary.  

The order also directs the staff to inform Mr. Brown by Aug. 3 of 
any progress made toward resolving problems regarding database 
and documentation, installation trouble, and missed due dates.  
The largest number of joint CLEC problems fell under those three 
areas.  The staff also will advise Mr. Brown by Jan. 4, 2002, as 
to what extent the other issues in the June 21 summary have been 
resolved.  (Rulemaking nos. 93-04-003 and 95-04-043, 
Investigation nos. 93-04-002 and 95-04-044)

NEW MEXICO -- PRC to reconsider area code decision

The Public Regulation Commission has voted unanimously to 
reconsider its decision ordering a "split" to relieve number 
exhaustion in the "505" area code.  The commission is drafting an 
order today that will include a schedule for hearings on the 
matter, a PRC staff member told TR.

A group of businesses, citizens, and governmental entities 
calling itself "The '505' Coalition," asked the PRC to reconsider 
the order.  (5/18/01)  The coalition is disappointed with the 
PRC's decision to assign the new "957" area code to the most 
populated areas of the state--Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Los 
Alamos.

The coalition said the PRC violated state law by allowing newly 
sworn in Commissioner Rory McMinn, who hadn't participated in any 
of the public hearings or meetings in the case to cast the 
deciding vote in the matter.  According to the coalition, state 
law (section 8-8-18 NMSA 1978) requires the recusal of a PRC 
commissioner or hearing examiner in any case in which the 
individual is unable to make a fair decision.  The coalition said 
that, according to PRC records, Mr. McMinn or his staff never 
reviewed the case's file.

MASSACHUSETTS -- DTE to defer DSL cost issues

Two Department of Telecommunications and Energy hearing officers 
have granted Verizon Massachusetts' request to defer 
consideration of two digital subscriber line (DSL) cost issues.  
Verizon asked the officers to delay establishing final rates for 
conditioning of loops that meet Carrier Service Area standards 
and final rates for line sharing collocation augment application 
and engineering services.

Verizon said it would be more efficient to address the two issues 
in the DTE's comprehensive TELRIC (total-element long-run 
incremental cost) docket.  The items are the final issues 
remaining in the DTE's 1998 advanced services rate investigation.

Covad Communications Co. opposed Verizon's request.  Covad said 
removing the issues to the TELRIC docket would deprive the 
parties of the extensive record on loop conditioning costs 
developed in the advanced service docket.  Covad also said the 
move would "entail unnecessary time and expense."

The DTE hearing officers said that the collocation and line 
sharing costs are within the scope of the TELRIC docket and that 
any matter contained in the advanced service docket would be 
available to the parties in the TELRIC docket.  The officers also 
noted that the rates proposed by Verizon in the TELRIC docket for 
the two DSL items are lower than the interim rates set in the 
advanced service docket.

Verizon will have to begin offering the lower proposed rates 
immediately, subject to true-up when the TELRIC docket is 
concluded.  (Docket no. D.T.E. 98-57, Phase III)

ARIZONA -- ACC approves price hike

The Corporation Commission has adopted a settlement that 
increases Southwestern Telephone Co.'s business and residential 
rates, sets a 9% rate of return, and increases the company's 
revenue by $20,000.  Southwestern, the commission staff, and the 
Residential Utility Consumer Office (RUCO) were parties to the 
settlement.

Southwestern originally asked for a 9.96% rate of return, based 
on a $3.9 million fair-value rate base (FVRB).  The commission 
staff and the RUCO proposed their own rates of return and FVRBs, 
and the three parties worked together on a settlement.  The 
agreement adopted the staff's proposed FVRB of $4.1 million.

The settlement will raise residential rates by 25 cents to $11.25 
and will raise business rates by 90 cents to $24.90.  
Southwestern serves about 4,600 access lines in the Quartzsite 
and Salome exchanges.  (Docket no. T-01072B-00-0379)

FLORIDA -- NeuStar to release 'growth code' to BellSouth

The Public Service Commission has ordered North American 
Numbering Plan administrator NeuStar, Inc., to release a "growth 
code" to BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., for the Magnolio-
ORLDFLMADS1 switch in the Orlando rate center.

BellSouth requested a growth code to meet a customer's request 
for 2,500 consecutive DID (direct inward dial) numbers in an NXX 
with a four as the last digit (NX4).  NeuStar denied BellSouth's 
request because the company hadn't met the rate center months-to-
exhaust (MTE) criteria required to obtain a growth code.  To 
qualify for a growth code, carriers must have no more than a six-
month inventory of telephone numbers in the rate center.  
BellSouth appealed NeuStar's decision to the PSC.

The commission said the MTE criteria create a disadvantage for 
carriers with multiple-switch rate centers.  One switch in a such 
a center may be near exhaust while the average MTE for the rate 
center is above six months, the PSC said.  When NeuStar denied 
BellSouth's code request, the MTE for the Magnolia-ORLDFLMADS1 
switch was four months.  (Docket no. 010309-TL)

NORTH CAROLINA -- Commission sets number-pooling schedule

The Utilities Commission has ordered Telcordia Technologies, 
Inc., to implement 1,000-number block pooling in the "919" area 
code by Oct. 26.  Number pooling will postpone "for as long as 
possible" the activation of the "984" overlay for the "919" area 
code and the introduction of mandatory 10-digit dialing, the 
commission said.  (Docket no. P-100, Sub 137)

CALIFORNIA -- PUC to mull advice letter procedures

A Public Utilities Commission administrative law judge has asked 
interested parties to comment on whether a hearing should be held 
to discuss various proposals to change the advice letter process.  
Regulated companies usually file advice letters to make routine 
tariff changes.

According to the ALJ, a consequence of the proliferation of the 
telecom industry is that the PUC's "procedures for different 
types of telecommunications advice letters also have proliferated 
rapidly, sometimes even on a utility-specific basis."  He said 
the goal of this proceeding was to unify and simplify existing 
procedures, which are scattered over many decisions and 
resolutions.

The ALJ said some parties have asked the commission to retain 
certain advice letter procedures, but they disagreed about which 
ones should be kept.  The ALJ has asked interested parties to 
respond by June 14 to his questions about advice letter 
procedures that are inconsistent with the commission's general or 
telecom rules.  Commenting parties also must discuss whether and 
why they think a hearing would be warranted.  (Rulemaking no. 98-
07-038, Rulemaking for purposes of revising General Order 96-A 
regarding informal filings at the Commission)

ALABAMA -- Rule would revise reporting requirements

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by June 25 
on a proposed rule that would require long distance carriers to 
identify, for informational purposes, their interstate long 
distance per-minute rates in their tariffs.  The proposed rule 
also would require carriers to identify the product name, per-
minute rates, minimum monthly charges, and billing increments 
applicable to intrastate long distance calling plans "within the 
same section under which the service is described in the tariff."

The new rule would help the PSC respond to customer complaints, 
the PSC said.  "Rates associated with the [intrastate long 
distance] plan such as the minimum monthly charge, call duration, 
billing increments, etc., may not be found in the same general 
area of the tariff as the rate schedule," the PSC said.  (Docket 
no. 15957)

NEBRASKA -- Gov. Johanns mulls fiber-optics bill

The Legislature has passed and sent to Gov. Mike Johanns (R.) 
legislation to prohibit governmental agencies or political 
subdivisions from providing telecom service for a fee or from 
becoming certified as contract or common telecom carriers.  
(3/23/01)  The measure would allow governmental agencies or 
political agencies to own, sell, and lease dark fiber.  The 
Public Service Commission would have to approve the lease price 
and profit distribution for governmental bodies leasing dark 
fiber.

Sens. Curt Bromm (Ind., District 23) and Bob Wickersham (Ind., 
District 49) introduced LB 827.

WISCONSIN -- New coalition seeks reliable telecom service

A coalition of Ameritech-Wisconsin customers and competitors has 
formed to "fight for affordable and reliable telephone service."  
The Wisconsin CALLS coalition includes the American Association 
of Retired Persons, the Citizens' Utility Board, the Wisconsin 
Merchants Federation, the Wisconsin Realtors' Association, the 
Wisconsin Apartment Association, and AT&T Corp. as members.

The coalition supports a legislative reform initiative to (1) 
establish specific service standards and penalties for poor 
service by Ameritech, (2) permit customers and competitors to sue 
Ameritech directly when it violates the law, (3) prohibit 
Ameritech from double charging customers and developers for 
connecting new real estate developments to the network, (4) 
impose measure to increase local competition, and (5) order 
structural separation of Ameritech.

Doug Johnson, senior vice president and general counsel for the 
Wisconsin Merchants Federation, said, "Our members depend upon 
the reliability and affordability of the local telecommunications 
system.  In the past year they have suffered major economic 
damage as a result of loss of service, slow response time, and 
high prices for basic service.  And since there is little or no 
local phone competition, our members have no alternatives."

ILLINOIS -- CUB urges commission to order Ameritech rate cut

The Citizens Utility Board yesterday renewed its call for the 
Commerce Commission to reduce Ameritech-Illinois' rates by $957 
million.  CUB was responding to a recommendation by two hearing 
examiners against including any revenue reduction when renewing 
the company's alternative regulation plan.  (5/22/01)

A review of Ameritech's finances conducted by CUB and other 
consumer agencies found that the company "has underreported its 
revenues and overstated its expenses to mask its true earnings 
and ward off any rate reduction."  When the company's books are 
adjusted for those discrepencies, CUB said, the study shows rates 
should be reduced by $957 million, a decrease that would save the 
typical customer $120 a year.

CUB Executive Director Martin Cohen said, "The hearing examines 
ignored all the evidence showing that Ameritech's rates are 
excessive.  But we've seen the ICC overrule their hearing 
examiners on many occasions.  We look forward to arguing our case 
directly to the ICC in the coming weeks."

The ICC is scheduled to rule on the hearing examiners' proposed 
order in July, according to CUB.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC adopts service-termination rules

The Public Service Commission has adopted rules governing service 
termination by competitive local exchange carriers.  The rules, 
which were first adopted on an emergency basis in March, also 
modify existing regulations on tariff reviews, certification, and 
annual reviews.  (3/30/01)

The rules will take effect when they are posted in the D.C. 
Register.  (Formal case no. 892, Approval of Competitive Local 
Exchange Carriers to Provide Telecommunications Services in the

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC wants comment on subloop UNEs

The Public Service Commission has asked for comments by May 29 
identifying subloop elements that Verizon Washington DC, Inc., 
must include in unbundled network element (UNE) cost studies due 
July 16.  (5/2/01) 

The PSC said Verizon and AT&T Corp. disagree as to whether a loop 
concentrator is a subloop element, which must be unbundled.  
Verizon argued that it isn't and that the FCC requires it to 
unbundle only two subloop elements--the loop distribution and the 
loop feeder.

The PSC said, "Verizon is incorrect in asserting that the FCC 
only included two subloop elements as UNEs; in fact the FCC 
requires all subloop elements to be unbundled."  The problem, the 
PSC said, is that there isn't a list of subloop elements.  
Although AT&T argued that the loop concentrator qualifies, "AT&T 
didn't define the term or explain its function," the PSC said.

Once parties provide a list defining each subloop element and 
explaining their functions, the PSC will set a final list of 
elements.  Verizon will have to provide costs for those elements 
in its UNE cost studies.  (Order no. 12004, Formal case no. 962,

Telecommunications Competition Act of 1996 and Implementation of

VERMONT -- PSB orders number pooling

The Public Service Board has ordered telecom carriers to begin 
1,000-number block pooling by May 1, 2002.  The PSB said although 
its single area code, "802," isn't in immediate danger, it still 
may be susceptible to premature number exhaust.  

The board noted a recent request for 98 central office codes 
advanced 802's projected exhaust date from 2011 to 2007.  The PSB 
said two more similar requests would exhaust the available number 
supply completely.

The board plans to select an interim number-pooling administrator 
within two months.  The PSB said it would establish a cost-
recovery mechanism before pooling begins and appointed a hearing 
officer to oversee the docket.  (Docket no. 6505, Investigation 
into Area Code Relief for the State of Vermont)

TEXAS -- WorldCom objects to SW Bell listing increase

WorldCom, Inc., has asked the Public Utility Commission to reject 
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.'s tariff increasing its directory 
assistance (DA) listing rates.  In an informational tariff 
filing, SW Bell increased its wholesale DA listing rates from 
0.11 cents to 4 cents per initial listing.  Informational tariffs 
take effect soon after filing, unless a party objects to it.

The PUC set cost-based rates for SW Bell's wholesale DA listings 
in separate dockets.  SW Bell said its DA listings should be made 
available at "market-based" rates consistent with the FCC's Feb. 
17, 2000, unbundled network elements (UNEs) order.  

WorldCom said the PUC's cost-based rates are permitted by the 
FCC's directory listings and UNEs orders.  (Docket no. 24142)

directory to customers in eastern Johnson County.  It plans to

VIRGINIA -- New '434' area code debuts June 1

North American Numbering Plan administrator, NeuStar, Inc., has 
assigned "434" to the area carved from the "804" area code last 
year.  The State Corporation Commission ordered the change in 
December 2000 when it opted for a "split"/"overlay" combination 
plan to relieve the impending number shortage in the 804 area.  
(12/4/01)

The 434 code will be launched June 1, marking the beginning of a 
seven-and-a-half month permissive-dialing period.  Mandatory use 
of the new code will begin Jan. 15, 2002.  The 434 code will 
serve areas to the south and west of the Greater Richmond area, 
including the cities of Charlottesville, Danville, and Lynchburg.

The 804 area code will continue to serve the Greater Richmond 
area, as well as the town of West Point and communities on the 
upper and middle peninsulas.  Verizon Virginia, Inc., said the 
change will have no effect on rates or local calling areas.

OREGON -- PUC opens certificate-transfer rulemaking

The Public Utility Commission yesterday opened a rulemaking on 
transferring to other carriers certificates of authority to 
provide telecom service, a PUC staff member told TR.  The 
commission doesn't have any rules on this issue.  (5/21/01)

The staff already has drafted a proposal based on the existing 
requirements for obtaining a certificate.  The proposal would 
require both parties to a transaction to file a joint 
application.  According to the staff, this would ensure that both 
parties concur with the specifics of the transfer.

The transfer applications also would be considered on an 
expedited basis.  The draft rules would abolish the proposed 
order and exceptions process in these cases, eliminating 36 days 
from the proceeding.

The commission scheduled a July 23 workshop and a Sept. 24 
hearing to receive input on the proposed rule.  (Docket no. AR 
415)

WISCONSIN -- Measure would prohibit 'spamming'

Rep. Steve Foti (R., Oconomowoc) and Sen. Mary Panzer (R., West

to protect consumers from unsolicited e-mail advertising, known 
as "spam."  Under AB 416, a person would have to include the 
letters "ADV" at the beginning of the message to indicate to the 
receiver that the e-mail is an advertisement.

E-mail advertisements also would have to include a toll-free 
number or return e-mail address so the recipients could respond 
and ask to have their e-mail addresses removed from the 
distribution list.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA -- PSC cancels service-quality meeting

The Public Service Commission has cancelled the June 5 meeting of 
its Local Exchange Carrier Quality-of-Service Working Group.  
Group member Verizon District of Columbia, Inc., earlier this 
month said the working group wouldn't be able to make May 
deadlines for submitting a draft performance-assurance plan and a 
report summarizing lost-order trouble tickets.

The PSC established new due dates for the group's reports.  The 
draft performance assurance plan is due June 8, the lost-order 
trouble ticket report is due June 22, and a draft performance 
metric change management plan is due July 6.  The PSC said its 
staff would reschedule the June 5 meeting "at a time that is 
convenient to the working group members."  (Formal case no. 990,

		 Subject: Summary of Evil RBOC Campaign

Sue, per our discussion earlier, I wanted to outline the latest on 
Tauzin/Dingell and the UNE proceeding at the FCC.  Over the past 2 days, 
Steve and I met with the staff of Sen. Wyden, Sen. Cantwell, Rep. Largent, 
Rep. Markey, and with Rep. Boucher.  Additionally, we attended an RGA forum 
on "broadband deployment" presented by Verizon and ATT, and  met with reps 
from Comptel.  We also spent some time (off the clock) with Aileen and 
Johnathan Hintzman w/ KDW.  From all of these sources, we came up with the 
following observations/takeaways:

The RBOCs have a very expensive, sophisticated campaign in place to reduce 
access to their high-speed networks (it is now generally accepted that this 
is the main thrust of their effort - not sec.271 relief for data),
This campaign has several facets - the Tauzin/Dingell bill, UNE Petition at 
the FCC, delay/refusal of UNE provisioning to CLECs.  The campaign's main 
themes are that the '96 Act was only to open local networks for voice 
competition, regulatory relief is needed for telcos to compete w/ cable 
monopolies, CLEC business plans are unsound unless they are facilities-based, 
and only use UNEs as a transitional method of entry,
Both the UNE Petition and the T/D Bill would effectively prevent the 
unbundling of ILEC network elements that are classified as "High-speed" or 
"broadband" - meaning wholesale access to any UNE beyond narrowband voice 
facilities would be denied.
Tauzin/Dingell is now on referral to the House Judiciary Cmte.  Judiciary has 
a relative short time to examine the bill (they were only referred the 271 
provision, not the whole legislation) and will then report the bill out with 
or without amendment,
According to Rep. Boucher, the anti-trust language of the Cannon/Conyers 
amendment (which would make unbundling/interconnection complaints against 
ILECs an automatic anti-trust violation) will not likely survive a full cmte 
vote and he believes the bill will go back to Commerce with little change,
Rep. Largent's office told us that they have not developed a floor strategy 
yet to attempt to defeat T/D when it gets to the full House, but they expect 
the final vote to be bitter and very close (probably in favor).
Our meetings with the Senate suggested that they are not likely to take up 
T/D.  We believe that is still the case, especially in a Democrat-controlled 
Senate (which should be determined very soon).  This would make Sen. 
Hollings, an ATT ally, Commerce chairman,
On the regulatory side, Comptel and KDW were both taking the UNE Petition 
very seriously,
Neither Steve nor I are confident that Comptel will carry a very effective 
argument this time - they are pursuing economic and network data that, in the 
end, will not make a convincing argument and will not have significant buy-in 
from other Comptel members.  Their focus on backbone network maps, IRUs, and 
deconstructing the USTA competition report is not constructive,
KDW is leading a group of small CLECs and has invited our participation.  I 
think that we should participate in the effort but hold off in determining 
whether to file our comments with them or separately until we have a better 
feel for the focus of their argument and if we can provide a unique 
perspective,

Based on the above, Steve and I have developed this prognosis:

T/D will likely fail to move in the Senate, though the RBOCs may try some 
different tactics than in the House.
Failing a legislative remedy, the RBOCs full energies will then focus on the 
FCC.
It is very difficult to say how the new commission will rule on the various 
regulatory proceedings there.  However, Congress can send strong cues to the 
commission and opportunities to push back the RBOCs will be available, 
especially if T/D fails in a big way.
The threat that these attempts by the RBOCs pose to EBS is paramount.  
Considering that the RBOCs will likely continue to gain 271 approvals in the 
states, the ability to have below special-access pricing for local 
connectivity will mean the success or failure of bandwidth trading, since 
there would be no way to compete with the Bells on end-to-end bandwidth 
services.

I hope this is helpful as you prepare your download to Ken/Kevin/Jim.  Please 
let Steve or I know if you have any questions or would like additional follow 
up on any of these points.  Thanks

Below is a reactive statement which should help you deal with external discussions and enquiries given the decision for EBS to not have a presence in Europe going forward.


"In common with other companies operating in the broadband market, Enron Broadband Services is taking further steps to consolidate its business to match the size of the foreseeable business opportunity. 

Poor demand for broadband services is being exacerbated by falling prices, requiring Enron to consider the best options for managing its global broadband business. 

During the next six months the European operations of EBS will be transferred from London to Enron's headquarters in Houston, where the company is well placed to manage the on-going requirements of customers around the world."

Dear Sue, Scott and Steve -- The letter below from George Gilder to FCC
Chairman Powell sets important parameters for our "vision".  We anticipated
that Powell would be unimpressed, if not hostile, to "open access"
approaches, but this should put a nail in the coffin.  The watchword will be
"innovation".  I imagine that both "Telecosm" and Hamel's "Leading the
Revolution" are high on Powell's reading list! 

We look forward to talking with you next week.  Aileen.

This is an interesting letter to Commissioner Powell published last week.
Given the level of respect that the Commissioner has for Mr. Gilder (MKP has
repeatedly referenced Gilder's book Telecosm and speaks of him frequently),
it may be worth reading.  In any event, it gives a pretty good 30,000 foot

The Broadband Economy Needs a Hero
By George Gilder and Bret Swanson

  Dear Mr. Powell:

  Whether you know it or not, your leadership and decisions over the next
four years will have more impact on the economy than those of Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.

   Surely, our stock-market swoon of 2000 and stagnating economic growth in
2001 are partly due to the Fed's inexplicable liquidity leash combined with
the highest tax burden since World War II. But the chief threats to the
21st- century economy are the politicians, bureaucrats and Silicon Valley
know-nothings responsible for America's broadband connectivity crisis.

  We owe Les Vadasz of Intel an apology for making fun of his prediction
that narrowband links would prevail into the 21st century. The Internet as
we know it is about seven years old, yet fewer than 7 million of 100 million
American homes enjoy broadband and its wealth of social, commercial and
educational opportunities.

  Contrary to popular belief, the chief obstacle to progress is not
entrenched Bell operating companies, but a regulatory regime that presumes
to "level the playing field," "equalize access," and "promote competition."
The only result of these policies has been the effective nationalization and
paralysis of broadband.

  The 1996 Telecommunications Act ruled that in exchange for the right to
enter the long-distance telephone business, the Bells must open their
residential copper lines to competitors, as well as allow these competitors
to locate equipment in Bell central offices and offer digital subscriber
line (DSL) services over Bell-owned copper. In November 1999, the FCC issued
a further decree forcing the Bells to stop dragging their feet and
cooperate.

  The FCC actions spawned a new category of start-ups known as broadband
competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs), which planned to compete with
the Bells. Funded by billions of dollars in Silicon Valley venture capital
and public offerings, companies like Rhythms, Northpoint, Covad and Jato
earned praise from "libertarians" in both Washington and Palo Alto, Calif.
Northpoint even had freedom-loving former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on its
board.

  But despite all good intentions, these were not high-tech start-ups. They
became venture capital-funded lobbying and litigation shops intent on
forcing the Bells to share their copper. With more press releases on new
lawsuits than on new subscribers, one of the companies epitomized the
strategy: "Rhythms continues successful regulatory litigation." The result
of all this lawyering? The CLECs won everything. Access to copper wherever
they sued. Multimillion- dollar awards from the Bells. And bankruptcy.
Bankruptcy?

  Late last year, Northpoint filed for Chapter 11 after Verizon withdrew an
$800 million investment. Jato closed its doors. Rhythms cut its staff by
23%. Covad is slashing 800 jobs and closing 260 central offices. Of Covad's
274,000 lines in service, 92,000 are not "recognizing revenue." And all of
this is happening in the face of massive consumer demand for broadband
services.

  The problem is that DSL is risky and hard. Some studies have reported that
50% of DSL hook-ups fail on the first try. Even amicable relationships
between CLECs and Bells are a software nightmare, with a different billing
and provisioning system for each service provider. Such difficulties render
DSL not a matter of will and politics but of technical and entrepreneurial
risks. Companies are forced to invest heavily in research and engineering
personnel, but have few opportunities for outsized rewards.

  That's because Congress and the FCC set up an awkward scheme in which
everyone got a piece of the action but no one could make any money. Often
barred from carrying signals across long-distance boundaries, the Bells hand
off traffic to other long-distance carriers. CLECs rent lines from the
Bells. And Internet service providers end up doing costly customer service
and marketing to get people signed up in the first place. In short, as many
as four parties routinely battle for low- or negative-margin chunks of
$40-monthly bills.

  By summoning new competition and then mandating the rivals cooperate in
open access, the government effectively privatized the risks and socialized
the profits. By December, the Bells had signed up 1.8 million users and the
CLECs 600,000, combining for just 2.4 million DSL subscribers among the 120
million or so copper-connected U.S. homes and businesses.

  Cable modems, with 4.9 million subscribers at year-end, have done better,
but AOL Time Warner and AT&T, America's two cable behemoths, are bogged down
by the same open-access nonsense that plagues DSL. Over the past two years,
AT&T CEO Michael Armstrong acquired $140 billion in cable assets while
watching his company's $184 billion market capitalization plummet to $81
billion.

  Just last month the Federal Trade Commission ruled that AOL Time Warner
must offer "at least one non-affiliated cable broadband ISP [Internet
Service Provider] service on Time Warner's cable system before AOL itself
begins offering service, followed by two other non-affiliated ISPs within 90
days and a requirement to negotiate in good faith with others after that."
The nation's second-largest ISP, EarthLink, will now get access to AOL's
expensive cables pretty much for free.

  This regulatory morass treats the most dynamic, technically creative, and
transformative industry in the world economy as if it were some static
commodity market for corn or pork bellies.

  Mr. Chairman, in a recent speech you made the key point that innovation is

more important than price competition. When it comes to leading-edge
services and technologies, narrow price competition is almost meaningless.
Internet innovation means qualitative change, order-of-magnitude price
reductions and constantly changing services that always constitute
monopolies when first launched.

  No Internet advantage can last more than a couple of years. In 1999 and
2000, over 150 million kilometers of optical fiber were laid world-wide,
enough to stretch to the sun. Hundreds of billions of dollars have already
been invested by metropolitan fiber-optic network builders (Metromedia
Fiber, Level 3 Communications), optical hardware companies (Avanex, ONI,
Sorrento) and optical service providers (Yipes, Cogent, Sphera). These
companies are already rendering the metropolitan DSL debate moot with
thousand-fold increases in price performance over existing technology.
Similar breakthroughs are on the way in residential wireless. But none of
these deployments, including fiber to the home, can flourish under a regime
of forced sharing of entrepreneurial assets and profits.

  In this environment, let the Bells compete in long-distance and extort any
temporary profits they can from their local copper cages. Let the cable
companies capitalize on their advantage for the few years it will last.
Allow the infinite spectrum of air and fiber to be exploited in any way its
owners wish. Then, sit back, and nostalgically recall those early days of
the Internet, when we naively thought a 5% economic growth rate was really
something. The broadband economy needs a hero. President Bush and Mr.
Greenspan need a technology savior. You are the man best equipped to play
that role.

AS COMMERCE COMMITTEE VOTE NEARS ON HR 1542,
BELLS SPAR WITH CLECs, IXCs OVER `SUBSTITUTE'

Bell company interests predict the Internet Freedom and Broadband
Deployment Act, HR 1542, will clear the House Energy and Commerce
Committee by a comfortable margin tomorrow.  Opponents, however,
hope that enough amendments and opposition will surface to dampen
Congress's enthusiasm for broadband "relief" legislation.

"It looks like it will pass," U.S. Telecom Association interim
President and Chief Executive Officer Gary S. Lytle told TR today
after a press briefing to review the legislation.  "It should get
somewhere in the mid to high 30s," he said, referring to the
number of members on the 57-person panel that USTA predicts will
vote for the bill at tomorrow's markup session.  The bill cleared
the telecommunications and the Internet subcommittee last month
by a 19-14 vote (TR, April 30).

Meanwhile, a "substitute" version of HR 1542 that began
circulating late last night (Monday) has sparked another round of
bickering between Bell company interests and members of the
competitive local exchange carrier and interexchange carrier
industries.  The substitute, released by Commerce Committee
Chairman W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.), incorporates the four
amendments that were approved by the telecom subcommittee.  It
also adds new language regarding FCC rules on ILECs' resale of
advanced services and "line sharing" and new definitions for
"Internet backbone services" and "Internet access service."

H. Russell Frisby Jr., president of the Competitive
Telecommunications Association, said the new provisions would
make the legislation "go from bad to worse under the guise of
compromise."  The new definition of "Internet backbone services"
is too broad, he said, as it would include too many services in a
deregulated regime.

Mr. Frisby also pointed to language that purportedly would
preserve CLECs' ability to implement line sharing.  The FCC's
line-sharing rules permit CLECs to offer data services over the
high-frequency portion of a line while the ILEC continues to
provide voice services over the lower-frequency portion.  But Mr.
Frisby said the substitute bill would invalidate later FCC orders
that "put the meat on the bones" of the line-sharing mandates.

According to a copy of the substitute draft, the FCC's rules on
line sharing would remain intact, but ILECs wouldn't be required
to provide access to the high-frequency portion of the loop at
the remote terminal -- a provision that another critic agrees
would "undercut" the Commission's line-sharing rules.  "If line
sharing is not allowed through remote terminals, then 35% of
consumers will be denied residential broadband competition
because of this bill," the CLEC source said.

That claim, however, was disputed by Thomas J. Tauke, senior vice
president-public policy and external affairs for Verizon
Communications, Inc.  Speaking with reporters at the USTA press
briefing, Mr. Tauke said the bill's new line-sharing language
would have a "minimal effect" on CLECs in Verizon's service
territory because "very few of them use" line sharing.  For
Verizon, the substitute language would eliminate the "economic
and practical problems of providing for line sharing when we have
fiber in the local loop," he said.

Rep. Tauzin's substitute bill also has new language requiring
ILECs to continue reselling advanced services at wholesale rates
for as many as three years after enactment of the bill.  The
original version of the bill would have given ILECs an immediate
exemption from resale obligations.

Committee staffers were said to be working out last-minute
details on another amendment that's expected to be offered
tomorrow by Reps. Cliff Stearns (R., Fla.), Bobby L. Rush (D.,
Ill.), and Thomas C. Sawyer (D., Ohio).  According to sources,
the amendment would give ILECs immediate regulatory relief.  But
it would require ILECs to make about 70% of their central offices
DSL (digital subscriber line)-ready by a date certain, most
likely within three years of enactment.

Mr. Tauke said Verizon would oppose any DSL buildout
requirements, saying "it's good public policy not to have a
buildout provision in this legislation."  The government should
mandate buildout requirements "only when the market isn't
working," he said.

Many of the same amendments that were withdrawn during the
telecom subcommittee's review are being teed up for tomorrow,
including several from Rep. Tom Davis III (R., Va.) and one from
Rep. Anna Eshoo (D., Calif.) to require Bell companies to
continue filing service-quality and accounting reports at the
FCC.  Rep. Tauzin has said he would address FCC "enforcement"
issues at tomorrow's markup session, but he may not tackle those
issues through legislation.

Asked by TR whether Rep. Tauzin planned to offer an FCC
enforcement amendment to HR 1542, spokesman Ken Johnson said
today, "I can only confirm that Reps. Tauzin and [Rep. Fred Upton
(R., Mich.)] will offer an amendment before the bill gets to the
House floor to substantially beef up the FCC's enforcement"
tools.


***************************************************************
JUDGE:  CLECs DON'T HAVE TO GIVE ILECs ACCESS TO RIGHTS-OF-WAY

A federal district judge in Lincoln, Neb., has ruled that
competitive local exchange carriers (CLECs) aren't required to
give incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) access to their
poles, ducts, and rights-of-way.  Judge Richard G. Kopf made the
determination in "AT&T Communications of the Midwest, Inc., v. U
S WEST Communications, Inc., et al." (case no. 4:97CV3286).

AT&T brought the lawsuit in 1997, seeking to overturn the
Nebraska Public Service Commission's approval of an
interconnection agreement.  That agreement required AT&T to give
U S WEST (now Qwest Corp.) "reciprocal access" to poles, ducts,
and rights-of-way.  Consideration of the lawsuit was delayed by
judicial challenges to the FCC's landmark 1996 order on carrier
interconnection.

Judge Kopf was faced with a split among federal courts on how to
handle an apparent contradiction in the Communications Act of
1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.  Section
251 of the Act appears to require all local exchange carriers
(LECs) -- whether ILECs or CLECs -- to grant access to their
rights-of-way, the judge said.  But section 224 seems to require
that all LECs grant access only to competitive, not incumbent,
local exchange carriers, he said.

The FCC had based its regulations on section 224, and most
federal district courts had deferred to that interpretation,
Judge Kopf said.  But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit (San Francisco) has said it "doubts the soundness of the
FCC's interpretation of section 251."

Judge Kopf, however, followed the other district courts and
deferred to the FCC's interpretation.  He concluded that "in
light of the Act's purpose, [which is] to promote competition,. .
.the FCC's interpretation that no ILEC may seek access to the
facilities or rights-of-way of a LEC or any utility under either
section 225 of section 251 is based on a permissible construction
of the statutes and does not conflict with the plain meaning of
the Act."

Judge Kopf ruled that the reciprocal-access portion of the
companies' interconnection agreement violated the Act and the
FCC's rules.  He enjoined Qwest from enforcing that portion of
the agreement.


***************************************************************
FCC PROPOSES CHANGING USF CONTRIBUTION SYSTEM

The FCC has proposed "streamlining and simplifying" the way it
collects Universal Service Fund (USF) contributions.  The
proposals, which include limiting how carriers recover
contributions from their customers and using a flat-rate
assessment, are aimed at dealing with recent changes and
developing trends in the industry.

The FCC recently tweaked the USF contribution system to reduce
the "lag time" between accrual of revenues and payment of
contributions based on those revenues (TR, March 19).  At that
time, it said it soon would consider "more fundamental modifica-
tions" to the USF contribution mechanism.  The USF supports
affordable service in "high-cost" areas and discounted service
for low-income customers, schools, libraries, and rural health
care providers.

USF contributions currently are assessed as a percentage of
carriers' interstate and international end-user telecom service
revenues.  The percentage is based on revenues as of six months
before the contributions are collected.  The FCC allows carriers
to decide for themselves whether and how to recover contribution
costs from their customers.

In a statement today, the FCC said the following industry trends
affect USF contributions:  (1) the entrance of new companies --
such as the Bells -- into certain long distance markets, (2)
growth in the wireless telecom sector, to the extent that
wireless carriers' interstate revenues may exceed the FCC's
interim "safe harbor" threshold for contributions, and (3)
increased bundling of services, making it difficult to
distinguish interstate from intrastate revenues.

The FCC is seeking comments on whether it should require carriers
to contribute a percentage of their collected revenues, rather
than a percentage of their billed revenues, to the USF.  It wants
to know whether it should assess contributions based on current
or projected revenues.

The Commission also asks whether it should use a flat assessment,
such as a fixed per-line charge; if it should require that
carriers give customers a uniform description of contribution
recovery charges; and whether those charges should be limited to
the amount of the contribution assessment.


***************************************************************
FCC's WIRELESS BUREAU SIDES WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ON `E911'
COSTS

The FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau has sided with
public safety agencies in a dispute over who should bear more of
the financial burden for installing Phase I "enhanced 911" (E911)
systems.

In a May 7 letter to the King County (Wash.) E911 Program, bureau
Chief Thomas J. Sugrue clarified that the 911 selective router
maintained by incumbent local exchange carriers is the proper
demarcation point for allocating E911 implementation costs
between wireless carriers and public safety answering points
(PSAPs).

The bureau's determination supports the view held by PSAPs.=20
Carriers, on the other hand, had maintained that PSAPs should be
responsible for E911 network components or upgrades beginning at
carriers' switches.  The bureau sought comments on the issue last
year in response to King County's request for a clarification of
the FCC's position (TR, Aug. 21 and Sept. 25, 2000).

In the letter, Mr. Sugrue stressed that the agency "continues to
favor negotiation between the parties as the most efficacious and
efficient means for resolving disputes regarding cost allocations
for implementing Phase I."  But PSAPs still will have to bear
some costs, he said, including upgrades to the 911 selective
router, trunking equipment, and other hardware and software.


***************************************************************
STUDY SAYS MOBILE PHONE USE
PLAYS LITTLE ROLE IN ACCIDENTS

Mobile phones are responsible for distracting drivers in only a
small percentage of vehicle accidents, according to an analysis
of accident data released today.  The University of North
Carolina's Highway Safety Research Center compiled the study for
the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety using data from the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Crashworthiness
Data System.

The data were collected from 1995 to 1999 on 32,303 vehicles
involved in crashes in which at least one vehicle was towed from
the scene.  Results were weighted to calculate national
estimates.

In crashes where driver distraction was a factor, 29.4% of the
time that distraction was something outside the driver's vehicle,
the study found.  Drivers' attempts to adjust car radios was a
factor in 11.4% of collisions involving driver distraction, and
passengers were a factor in 10.9% of those crashes, the study
said.

Mobile phones were number eight on the list of driver
distractions.  Use of wireless phones preceded 1.5% of crashes
where driver distraction was a factor, the study said.  The
margin of error for each category varied from 0.4% to 7.2%; for
mobile phone use, it was 0.9%.

Jane Stutts, manager of epidemiological studies at the UNC center
and the study's author, told TR that the mobile phone results
were "surprising just because people assume that cell phones
cause a lot of crashes."  But she stressed that many drivers may
be reluctant to tell police that they were distracted by using a
phone.  "They may try to hide it," she said.  The estimates for
mobile phone use were based on only 42 reported cases.

Ms. Stutts also noted that the driver distraction was listed as
"unknown" for almost 36% of the cases studied.  She said this
fact highlights the need for improved collection of accident
data.


***************************************************************
CABLEVISION WON'T HELP AT&T SELL $2B CABLEVISION STAKE

Cablevision Systems Corp. executives today said they don't intend
to help AT&T Corp. sell $2 billion in Cablevision shares.  AT&T
had asked Cablevision, a cable TV system operator based in
Bethpage, N.Y., to register the 30 million shares with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, allowing for a public sale
(TR, April 16).

"Cablevision has notified AT&T that we will not proceed at this
time with the registration of their shares" of Cablevision common
stock, said William Bell, Cablevision's vice chairman.  Instead,
Cablevision is considering its own public stock sale to raise
funds to improve its cable TV networks, he said during a
conference call with investors and analysts.

Cablevision's decision may complicate AT&T's efforts to sell the
shares, which it inherited in the 1999 takeover of Tele-
Communications, Inc.  AT&T wants to sell the stake to raise funds
for debt reduction and to thin its cable TV holdings.  The FCC's
rules regarding cable TV ownership are in limbo after being
vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington.  But AT&T has
been maneuvering to sell some cable TV holdings in preparation
for the enactment of new rules.

AT&T still can sell the Cablevision shares, Mr. Bell said.  AT&T
has "piggyback" registration rights that entitle it, under
certain conditions, to add its shares to Cablevision's public
stock offerings, according to SEC documents.  "AT&T may or may
not be able to exercise some piggyback rights," Mr. Bell said.=20
"It really will depend on market conditions and what
Cablevision's needs are."


***************************************************************
FCC SEEKS EXTRA $4M FOR ENGINEERING PROGRAM

The FCC is asking congressional appropriators to earmark an
additional $4 million for its fiscal year 2002 budget.  The funds
would help pay for a new "Excellence in Engineering" training and
recruitment program.  President Bush has proposed $248 million
for the FCC for FY 2002 -- an 8% increase over the Commission's
current appropriation level (TR, April 16).

In a letter to Sen. Conrad Burns (R., Mont.), FCC Chairman
Michael K. Powell says the extra money would be used for
recruitment incentives, educational initiatives for advanced and
"non"-engineers at the FCC, and upgrading the agency's technical
equipment.

"The overarching goal of the program is to ensure that the
Commission maintains a high level of technical expertise so that
it is at least as fluent in technology and engineering issues as
are the entities it regulates," Mr. Powell said in the May 4
letter.

Mr. Powell's letter included draft legislation that would allow
the FCC to establish salaries for engineers and other technical
and professional hires that are "more competitive with the
private sector."  The proposal also authorizes each Commissioner
to hire a professional engineering assistant in addition to the
three professional assistants they currently are allowed.

A Burns spokeswoman said the lawmaker was "working with Mr.
Powell to submit the budget request."  Sen. Burns is chairman of
the communications subcommittee and is a member of the
Appropriations Committee.=20

UPDATE FROM EBS OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN

Since its inception just two years ago, Enron Broadband Services has made=
=20
significant progress toward achieving our ambitious goals of being the=20
leading=20
provider of premium broadband content and the largest buyer and seller of=
=20
bandwidth on a global basis.  We are extremely proud of the company=01,s=20
accomplishments and equally optimistic about the future of EBS.

The market for bandwidth intermediation and risk management is developing=
=20
more quickly than anticipated =01) faster than the markets for natural gas =
or=20
even=20
electricity had developed.  Global Trading and Risk Management has already=
=20
executed more than 600 transactions this year, far exceeding the 321 total=
=20
transactions executed in 2000. The Enron Intelligent Network (EIN), with
its first-of-a-kind pooling point infrastructure, is in place to provide th=
e=20
physical=20
backbone and switching platform to support EBS=01, emerging bandwidth and=
=20
related trading operations.

Likewise, EBS has developed a superior technical and commercial platform to=
=20
digitally deliver entertainment on-demand.  While we have terminated our=20
relationship with Blockbuster because of their inability to secure content,=
=20
we=20
remain confident that EBS will be successful in independently acquiring=20
content=20
commitments and developing distribution partnerships for this exciting new=
=20
business.

EBS will continue to evolve as we build upon our presence in the bandwidth =
and
network services market.  While the market for broadband services in the U.=
S.=20
and globally has undergone significant change in recent months, the demand=
=20
for=20
broadband services continues to grow dramatically and EBS has the skills an=
d=20
strategy required to be successful long term.

To better focus our efforts and respond to the market, we have made some=20
organizational changes to enable us to effectively execute our strategy and=
=20
efficiently grow EBS.  These changes are outlined below and a current=20
organizational chart is attached.

David Cox, formerly Managing Director of Content Origination, has been name=
d=20
Chief Commercial Officer, reporting to the EBS office of the chair.  This n=

Digital Content Services, formerly Content Origination, is now led by Frank=
=20
Bay=20
with Rich DiMichele and Ed Smida.  Rich will focus on the development of th=
e=20
content risk management business.

Stewart Seeligson is now leading an expanded Wholesale Origination unit=20
combining=20
media transport opportunities that Stewart has been developing in the=20
broadcast=20
industry and opportunities that Ted Seitz has been pursuing with traditiona=
l=20
carriers,=20
ISPs, and network service providers.  This new origination team will focus =
on=20
executing highly structured transactions with significant value in the=20
wholesale market.

John Echols now leads the Enterprise Origination unit with Jim Crowder, Mat=
t=20
Harris,=20
and Brad Nebergall.  Bryan Burnett also has joined the Enterprise team from=
=20
Enron=20
North America=01,s Industrial Markets group.  John=01,s group will focus on=
=20
intermediation=20
opportunities with technology, financial, and corporate customers.

Dale Surbey has joined EBS from Enron North America to lead the Structuring=

EBS WELCOMES NEW EMPLOYEES
Please welcome the following new employees to EBS:

Starcom voices interest, though industry remains skeptical=20
Enron Media Services has piqued the interest of Starcom North America with=
=20
its plans to=20
create a futures market for buying and selling media time and space.

In a recent letter to Starcom's clients, CEO Renetta McCann said the=20
Chicago-based media=20
company was in talks with Enron to examine the possibility of a deal.

"Despite what has been a negative reaction thus far from the industry, we=
=20
find Enron's plan=20
intriguing," McCann wrote. "Clearly, Enron proposes breaking the rules of h=
ow=20
media can be=20
bought and sold."

Last year, Enron Corp., the $30 billion financial risk management company=
=20
previously associated=20
with the energy industry, created EMS to market "price-risk management" pla=
ns=20
to advertisers=20
and media-service companies. In addition, Houston-based Enron seeks to=20
execute $1 billion in media=20
buys by year's end, though a representative declined to release information=
=20
about any possible deals.

In this volatile economy, marketers and media agencies could use Enron's=20
ability to hedge the risk=20
of media costs as far as five years ahead, said Edward Ondarza, a vp for EM=
S.=20

Up to this point, the only way marketers could cushion risk is by "buying=
=20
forward" via the upfront,=20
he added. "We want to create a year-round upfront by developing a media=20
exchange [between=20
advertisers, media agencies and networks]," he said.

Despite Enron's pitch, Starcom has received little feedback to the letter=
=20
from its clients, said Kevin=20
Gallagher, vp and director of local investments for Starcom, which claims=
=20
$4.3 billion in billings=20
and has clients such as General Motors and Kraft. "We're always open to new=
=20
ways of doing=20
business, and we wanted to keep our clients apprised of what's going on," h=
e=20
said. "But we are=20
not engaged in any business with Enron. It was and remains merely=20
exploratory."

Many industry insiders remain skeptical of Enron's business model, because =
of=20
possible legal issues=20
and the novelty of the concept. But they acknowledge that eventually Enron'=
s=20
approach will become=20
commonplace.

"In theory it's great, but the practice is more difficult," said Jon Mandel=
,=20
MediaCom chief negotiating=20
officer. "There are some big issues that need to be worked out."

In the first quarter, Enron Broadband Services transacted seven times the=
=20
amount of bandwidth than it had in=20
the previous quarter, the unit of energy giant Enron Corp. announced=20
Tuesday. =20

The subsidiary showed a loss of $35-million in the quarter on revenues of=
=20
$83-million, the results being=20
attributed to the buildout of its fiber network and pooling points.

President and CEO Jeffrey Skilling said the broadband unit closed 580=20
transactions in the quarter, more than=20
double the level of the previous quarter. More impressive was the seven-fol=
d=20
increase in transacted bandwidth=20
this quarter: 43,400 Terabytes versus 6,005 Terabytes in the fourth quarter=
. =20
Enron is =01&making excellent=20
progress in creating a commodity market,=018 Skilling said. =20

Seventy new broadband customers were added in the quarter, for a total of=
=20
120.  Of that number 70%=20
of the customers are carriers or network service providers, a spokeswoman=
=20
told BMR, adding that half of=20
the deals done in the quarter were with that group.



Bandwidth intermediation/trading was the other key driver, with 580=20
transactions posted during the=20
quarter, a significant ramp-up from 232 reported 4Q:00 and 320 for all of=
=20
2000. In our view, we are=20
way past the question =01&Can bandwidth be commoditized?=018 and are enteri=

period of rapid=20
growth in commodity volumes which precedes the all-important emergence of=
=20
profitability.  In the=20
energy commodity markets, particularly natural gas and power in both the=20
United States and=20
Europe, the commodity volume growth phase lasted 1-3 years before=20
profitability emerged. We=20
see no reason for the bandwidth commodity market, which from a commodity=20
perspective =01&looks,=20
acts and feels=018 like electricity and natural gas, to perform any differe=
ntly=20
from these commodities.=20
We are entering Year 2 of the period of rapid volume growth. The next=20
catalyst in our view, will=20
be for Enron to announce a reasonably =01&date certain=018 for profitabilit=
y, much=20
in the same manner=20
as they did for Enron Energy Services several years ago. We think that date=

could be late 2002=20
or early 2003.

Excerpts:

...Enron's vice president and broadband trader, Paul Racicot, says Enron=20
alone could enter into 2,000=20
trades this year, but some analysts don't expect volumes to reach much more=
=20
than that in the entire market.=20
And while liquidity on such major routes as Los Angeles/New York and New=20

substantially, 2001 will likely be remembered as the year progress was made=

on issues whose resolution=20
was critical to the long-term health of the market.

...Probably the best-known proposal to promote network connectivity in the=

I tried to put most of your latest stuff in this version and I trust you are 
fine with it.
If not, please let Appolina know by Monday, midday. I will have no more input

Cynthia:

Here's a memo Scott Bolton put together which reflects his thoughts on a 
broad EBS Washington strategy for next year.  I commented on it before it 
went out.  It's still a work in progress.

Item 3 in particular might be of interest tomorrow when you participate in 
Pres-elect Bush's Commerce Department transition team meeting.  

We would propose consolidating the funding of high-cost telecommunications 
infrastructure within NTIA at Commerce.  This idea was floated a few weeks 
ago by industry, but received luke warm support.  It would serve our 
interests well in moving toward a coordinated federal broadband strategy, 
which we could more effectively target and influence.

Thanks, and good luck.

Steve

We have some additional information on this as well that we just got wind of 
this afternoon.  The Interlata relief bill that will be introduced on Monday 
or Tuesday by Congressmen Tauzin and Dingell will be nearly identical to last 
year's bill, H.R. 2420.  Tauzin will hold a full committee hearing on the 
bill next Wednesday with invited witnesses to include Verizon, Covad, Highway 
One (a DSL carrier in NY) and McLeod.  We aren't aware of any administration 
types being invited, i.e. Powell or someone from NTIA.  A subcommittee markup 
will likely be scheduled for the following week, with the full committee 
mark-up to occur sometime before Memorial Day, depending on what is happening 
in the Committee with regards to the California situation.

On the Senate side, we are hearing that Senator Sam Brownback will 
reintroduce his RBOC legislation from last year which is more of a RBOC 
friendly bill than Tauzin's in that RBOCs would no longer be subject to 
Federal requirements concerning facilities and equipment carriage of advanced 
communications services.  We understand that Brownback intends to introduce 
his legislation sometime before Memorial Day but that he is actively seeking 
a Democratic co-sponsor, something that he was not able to do last Congress 
either.  Opponents of the bill are working the Senate side to ensure he does 
not find an ally.  We understand that Tauzin has kept in close contact with 
his fellow Louisianan Senator John Breaux on the goings-on in the House and 
that Breaux may be willing to help move things along in the Senate, however 
as Scott stated previously, Senator McCain, as we know, is likely not to take 
an active position on the legislation.  Senators Hollings (Ranking Member of 
the Commerce Committee), Senator Stevens and Senator Lott are all said to be 
against moving forward with any form of 271 relief.  Despite all of the 
Senate activity, the bottom line is that Scott's assessment is accurate - we 
don't see anything moving out of the Senate this year.

Federal Sec. 271 Relief Legislation:  Rep. Billy Tauzin, Chairman of the 
House Commerce Committee, is expected to introduce legislation on 4/23 to 
enable ILECs to provide interLATA data services without opening their local 
networks to competitors.  The bill would allow the Bells to transmit data 
across local market boundaries and also allow the RBOCs to deploy 
high-capacity facilities without having to lease or resell them as UNEs. Rep. 
John Dingell, the Commerce Committee ranking member will be a co-sponser.

This bill last Congress had over 200 co-sponsors and made it to committee 
mark-up, but was stifled by then-Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley and supporters 
of AT&T.  This year, Tauzin is expected to push it through his committee 
vigorously and it may come to the House floor for a vote.  However, the 
Senate seems unlikely to take this up in a serious way this year due to Sen. 
McCain's reluctance to follow Rep. Tauzin's agenda and Sen. Hollings' solid 
support of AT&T.  We expect this legislation to create a lot of noise this 
year, but not move through the Senate until next year if at all.
