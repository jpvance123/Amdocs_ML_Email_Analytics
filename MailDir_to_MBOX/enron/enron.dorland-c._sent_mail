I think Rob and I might try to golf (or just hit some balls) after work. If we do we will probably go to Tradition (way North). I'll let you know. If I'm not going to be home I could leave your Amex in an envelope at the office of my apartment or you could grab it when I get back. Let me know...

FX is a total fucking mess in Calgary. I have actually thought about the 
problems a little bit. Call me if you want to talk about specifics (x3-1663). 
Things in Houston are good. The weather is great now. Year round golf is 
nice. Power is a total shit show. The volatility is crazy and this is the off 
season. I need to get rested up for the summer. Take it easy

I think that you should make her something. Perhaps you could draw a picture or make something out of paper mache. I'll stop by Tiffany's and see if they have anything to go with her bracelet and earings (from x-mas).

Later skater...

I haven't called Northern Trust yet. I will call them this afternoon. With 
regard to the benefits I don't think I have received the 2001 benefits 
package yet but I will check. If I don't want to change my coverage do I have 
to fill anything out?

Rod,

What do you think of the Canadian bank stocks? Relative to their US counterparts they seem cheap. I know that the discount is due regulation (no take overs or mergers) but in a 4% interest rate environment a 4% dividend yield looks pretty attractive. Not to mention they continue to crank out earnings quarter after quarter.

Hey,

What's up? Dave is in Mexico but I will call Scott and see if he has plans. We might be having a trading group bonding session (dinner and intense drunkeness) on Friday at my boss's hoose but if not I'd love to check out the game. Can I let you know tommorow? Let me know...

Anne,

I still haven't received any pay stubs since I have been in Houston. Can I 
get copies of those somehow? Could you send my something in the inter-company 
mail so I can see if my mail stop has been really been changed? I haven't 
received any mail of any kind which seems kind of weird. 

Thanx 

Chris Dorland

(P.S. thanx for the PRC info.)

Terry,

I didn't receive any call (I may have accidentally deleted it) but I filled 
out an accomplishment sheet for Barry Tycholiz yesterday.

Thanx,

Chris

You not working today? I called like 3 times. Did you hear about Jaimie Hawley's litttle brother? She must be a mess. I haven't got anything for Mom's b-day yet. Any great ideas? Did she get her flowers for Mother's day? Father's day is coming up June 17. Maybe we should give Dad that Arnold Palmer flag for father's day. Later...

Jill,

All is well in Houston. Finally getting settled in. Work is crazy. Trading 
power is not for the faint of heart. This is susposed to be the quiet season 
and I can't believe the volatility. How are things with you? All is well I 
trust. I will have to come for a visit some time to escape the Houston heat. 
Better go but keep in touch!

H town is good. Work is crazy but I like my new role. The weather is nice vs. 
snow in Cow town. How are things with you? Are you still commuting across the 
country? What is your buddy at William's name? Do you know what region he 
trades? Getting busy now better hop.

Keep in touch,

Chris

Hello to the Houston Gang,

I was mistakenly posted as a reviewer for Ricardo Perez. Either Chris is  
trying to pass himself off as his charming younger brother again or IT has 
messed up our emails on the PEP system.  Please contact IT support:

Mike,

What's going on? I'm coming home Nov.22 for a few days. Ryan and I are going 
to go snowboarding on Friday the 24th. You should come. I am really happy 
with my car. It is a silver/black IS 300. I was suffering a little post 
purchase anxiety but I'm over it. Fuck it! You live once. Things here are 
pretty good. It helps having a couple of good friends who have been here a 
while. How are things in Calgary? I hope you have pictures from Halloween. 
Send me you address and phone #'s. I lost my old address book. I am loving 
this palm pilot. You have to get one of these things. I am going to buy a 
playstation sometime this week. Should I buy Tony Hawk 1 or 2? Better hop. 
I'll call you one night this week.

Chris

Some of my questions. 

What is the difference between the 401K plan and savings plan?

How much does Enron contribute / match for each plan?

What is the max. annual 401k contribution?

Thanx,

Chris

Crystal,

Scott is off to Dallas for the weekend but I think I can swing checking out a game on Friday. How many people? I'll try to find some Enron tickets. Let me know...

Kim,

Can you contact Mikie Rath regarding my 401K plan. I haven't received 
anything from Northern Trust and would like to get set up. I would like begin 
contributing as soon as possible. 

Thanx,

Chris

(PS The way it was explained to me the $10 500 / annum contribution limit is 
only for personal contributions and does not include company matching, is 
this correct?)

Patrick,

Good to hear from you. I won't be needing my blubber where I am. I moved to 
Houston at the end of September. Things here are good. I'm trading 
electricity in the North Eastern US and so far things are going pretty well. 
I never did make it to Toronto this summer. Hope things are going well for 
you and keep in touch. 

Chris

Subject: Market Opening Dates

Hey Chris,

I am doing some research on historical prices in surrounding power markets 
and I am trying to determine the wholesale market-opening dates for NE power 
markets. I am also interested in dates when locational marginal pricing (LMP) 
was implemented (if at all).

I was able to get dates for every market but Cinergy and ECAR. Please let me 
know if you can tell me who to contact, and/or if someone in Houston can dig 
this up for me.

I don't mean to be a burden, but Jeff Borg was hoping I could come up with 
this for a 3:00pm meeting today.

Thanks bro,

Dan

What is the address of the HR website where I can see my old pay stubs? I'm 
trying to sort out my parking situation.

How was the Polo match? Did you catch the Sopranos season finale? A little disappointing if you ask me. I worked out yesterday and I can't straighten my arms. A little uncomfortable. Bring on the Advil. Talk to you later...

Anne,

According to the people at the PEP help desk I don't exist. Maybe that's why 
I don't get mail or paystubs?

I'm glad you had a good time. I know about 2 DM songs so I don't think I would have had as much fun in the rain.

Lloyd,

I would like Ricardo and I to sit down with Kevin and go over how our PJM 
load forecast model works. I want to use it, or a version of it, for day to 
day sensitivity analysis. I haven't met Kevin yet so if you could mention 
this to him I would appreciate it. I would also like to sit down with you 
some time this week to talk about PJM fundamentals and co-ordinating our 
analytical efforts. I want to get a feel for what we have done and set some 
goals as to what needs to be done. Let me know if one afternoon this week 
works for you. 

Thanx,

Chris Dorland

Mike,

Change my e-mail address to Chris.Dorland@enron.com. You have a really old 
one that I'm surprised is still supported (cdorlan@ect.enron.com).

Chris

(Like you will every see a $ from this!)
