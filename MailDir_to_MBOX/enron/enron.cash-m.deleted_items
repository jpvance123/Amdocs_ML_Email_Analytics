Attached is the URL to test the questionnaire.  Please review the content for consistency.  I would like to complete any final changes today.  We will do our final/final walkthru at the hotel on Friday.   Once I clear the test responses, you will be live and will not want anyone going into the survey to play... 

Thanks...

As you know, I leave tomorrow for a cruise to Mexico with my family.  I will be working from home in the morning (713-218-7155 or on my cell at  713-302-5522).  The ship does not depart until about 6, so my cell should work in the afternoon.

While on board, I can be reached on ship-to-shore.  The cost is $9.50 per minute.  The number is 1-877-225-7447.  You must haven the ship's name (Celebration) when you call.

I return to Galveston at 8 am on Saturday the 24th. 

Thanks, and Happy Thanksgiving! 

Michelle

Linda has informed plaintiff's counsel that the next round of depositions will more than likely have to take place in December because her November calendar is full.  I understand the process of scheduling deposition preparation meetings and depositions of K. Rice and K. Hannon are to be scheduled by you or your staff.  Please let me know their availability for approximately 1/2 -3/4 day prep and full day of deposition in December.  Thank you.  Lisa

Twanda, could you schedule some time for me to meet w/ Michelle on Wednesday, 10/23, to briefly discuss an Enron Freight Markets project?  I don't anticipate we would need more than 15 minutes.

I have a staff meeting schedule 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., and an afternoon meeting scheduled 2 p.m. to 3 p.m., but am otherwise free -- thanks, Bob

Diane,

I have updated both you and Michelle into our demo site so you can access
the course as if you are a learner, the older passwords were no longer valid
for this particular site. This will allow you to demo manager and employer
versions unlike the actual product itself which only allows you to see the
version you are assigned by the organization. This will make it easier to
review the courseware.



INSTRUCTIONS:

Clicking on the link below will take you to a sign-in screen.

Your user names are:    dgoode   mcash  (first initial, last name)

Password is:   enron

All entries are in lower case.


http://employer2001.elt-inc.com


After you click the "log in" button, you will be brought to a "Welcome"
screen.  Click on the "Course List" link.  You will now be brought to a
table with all of the courses available to you.

Click on any of the courses.  Your computer will check to make sure you have
macromedia installed, and if you do it will take you directly to the
"Launch" screen.  You'll want to click on "Launch the course with sound" and
you're all set.

If you get any security warnings simply click "yes".

ENJOY!  Please call if you have any questions.

Fraser, what do you think?



You asked me to provide my opinion about the employment agreement provisions relating to target bonus amounts that are based on performance.  

The bonus language contained in the majority of the agreements is as follows:

	"Provided that Enron meets its earnings targets and provided that Employee is rated within the top 25% of the performance criteria under Enron's annual performance rating system or its equivalent for the calendar year in question, Employee's annual bonus amounts under the Plan for calendar years 2001, 2002, and 2003 (payable in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively), shall be based on an annual bonus target of $_____________."

This language does not address a person's performance as compared to one's peers, but instead looks at the number of performance criteria and requires that a person be in the top 25% of those criteria.  Thus, if there are only 3 rating categories (i.e., 1,2,3, distributed as 10-80-10), the only the people in the top category would be within the top 25/33% of the rating criteria.

This result, however, would limit significantly the number of persons who are eligible to be paid the target bonus.  As a result, I would suggest that the middle category be divided further into either 2 or 3 subcategories (i.e., 2A, 2B, or 2C).  That way, persons who fall out in categories 1 or 2A would be eligible for the target bonus.

Lizzette. Would you mind getting with Diane on the isue of online harassment prevention training?  We have been looking into that form of delivering training. Diane has info from Littler on its proposed training. I think that the costs may be high, but I would like your evaluation of The product. Would you mind taking the lead on this?  Obviously, this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity. Thanks. Michelle

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Cynthia, Sandy,

Starting next week we will be rolling a out a Voluntary Separation Program for all employees of Enron Metals located in North America, roughly 70 employees who are all participating in Enron Corp's benefits plans.  The details of the this program are still being finalized by Michele Cash and her legal team, however, we will be communicating general details of the plan to our staff  tomorrow afternoon.

One of the communication documents that we will be providing employees is an FAQ of what happens in the event of termination, i.e. what happens to my vacation, what happens to by benefits, etc.   Do you have a similar Q&A document used in the past for these purposes?  Michele mentioned you may have something already prepared.  I could use the information provided in our normal termination letters, but if you've got something more in summary form, please let me know.

Please keep in mind, that I'll need to finalize the FAQ sheet for roll out Friday.

Thanks

Dear Lizzette:

As per our conversation this evening, I reviewed the memo.  It looks good to me.

I have one comment:  please make sure that the reference to "Code of Conduct" is revised to "Code of Ethics".  I note that it is referenced as Code of Conduct in one place and Code of Ethics in another.  As you know, the proper title is "Code of Ethics", I am sure that this was an oversight.

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review.

Sharon

>From what I understand, David Oxley walked someone out the earlier door today for posting in on an internet bulletin board.  I am trying to get details.  Did he run the termination by either of you? 

In any case, I've been told that he wants to publish a memo saying someone's been fired for breaking the rules.  I think that is a very, very bad idea.  So, I've drafted a reminder to give to David to publish instead.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Hi Michelle,
I received in today's mail a notice from the 127th District Court that the
Alonzo Williams case will be dismissed for want of prosecution unless we
file a sworn motion to retain, or motion for default judgment, before
November 2. We talked much earlier in the year about this, and I realize
that people have much larger priorities, but I never heard what the business
client wanted to do on this one. Can we have a conference call or meeting to
resolve this before the end of the month? Let me know your preference.
Best regards,
Bill Ogden

Jim and Rob,
 
I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in a position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below to your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom line is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not even responding to my requests for information.
 
I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to handle this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already causing me serious  problems and potential losses.
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Thanks and hope to see you soon.
 
Diomedes.

Mary Joyce,
 
I hope all is well with you. 
 
I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.
 
After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November". 
 
As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.
 
These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.
 
Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.
 
I look forward to hearing from you,
 
Regards,
 
 
Diomedes Christodoulou.

HIGHLIGHTS

HOUSE PASSES ECONOMIC STIMULUS;  CRITICS SAY WORKER AID
FALLS SHORT

By a vote of 216-214, the House passes a broad economic
stimulus bill (H.R. 3090) that includes provisions to expand
unemployment insurance and health care benefits for laid-off
workers. Seven Republicans voted against the proposal, while
three Democrats voted in favor. Rep. Johnson (R-Conn.) says
the bill, sponsored by House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Thomas (R-Calif.), would put $9 billion into state
coffers within 10 days of enactment.

 The bill would allow states to use the funds to pay regular
unemployment benefits, increase benefit payments, extend
benefits beyond 26 weeks, expand benefit eligibility, or for
administrative purposes. The bill also would extend the work
opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit
through Dec. 31, 2003, and contains provisions to boost the
Social Services Block Grant program by $3 billion so that
states can give health coverage to the unemployed.

Critics of the bill--including congressional Democrats,
labor, and civil rights groups--claim the measure will not
accomplish the Republicans' stated goals of stimulating the
economy and getting displaced workers back on the job. A
substitute measure offered by House Democrats is rejected by
a vote of 261-166. Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.)
tells reporters that he hopes the Senate will be able to
pass its own version of an economic stimulus bill before
Thanksgiving. . . . Page AA-1

ARKANSAS COURT ORDERS TRIAL ON WHETHER BIPOLAR DISORDER IS
PHYSICAL

A former Smith Barney employee is entitled to a trial to
decide whether his bipolar affective disorder is a mental
illness subject to a 24-month cap on benefits under a
long-term disability policy or a physical illness not
subject to a cap, the Arkansas Supreme Court rules
unanimously ("Elam v. First Unum Life Ins. Co., "Ark., No.
00-1430, 10/18/01). Reversing summary judgment for First
Unum Life Insurance Co., the supreme court holds that
because both the insurer and James Elam submitted evidence
outside of the insurance policy to support their
interpretations of the term "mental illness," the issue is a
question of fact for a jury to decide.

The policy defines mental illness as "mental, nervous or
emotional diseases or disorders of any type." Arguing the
term is ambiguous, Elam says bipolar affective disorder is a
physical illness with a biological origin that is treated
with medication. . . . Page A-1

SIXTH CIRCUIT BLOCKS MOVE TO SEPARATE FLSA, LMRA CLAIMS

A former truck driver's attempt to separate claims he
brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the
Labor-Management Relations Act in order to avail himself of
the FLSA's two-year statute of limitations falls short, as
the Sixth Circuit finds the wage claim barred by the federal
labor law's six-month limitations period ("Martin v. Lake
County Sewer Co., "6th Cir., No. 00-00228, 10/17/01). In
addition to seeking unpaid wages under the FLSA after his
discharge, Donald Martin charged his former employer, Lake
County Sewer Co., with violating the terms of its collective
bargaining agreement with a Teamsters local in violation of
LMRA Section 301. Martin also contended that the union
violated its duty of fair representation under Section 301
by failing to pursue a grievance against Lake for allegedly
improper deductions in his benefits and pay.

Martin argues his FLSA claim is distinct from the Section
301 claim and therefore governed by the wage law's two-year
limitations period. According to the Sixth Circuit, however,
Martin's charge relating to the unpaid wages was based on
the provision in the collective bargaining agreement
governing compensation and must be resolved in accordance
with LMRA procedures. . . . Page A-8

NURSE'S AIDE ASSAULTED BY CO-WORKER CAN PROCEED WITH SUIT

A nurse's assistant who was sexually assaulted by a
co-worker can proceed with a series of claims against an
upstate New York health care facility, despite the fact that
the employer immediately suspended and later discharged the
alleged attacker, a federal magistrate judge rules ("Becker
v. Ulster County, "N.D. N.Y., No. 99-CV-1278, 10/10/01).

Rejecting a summary judgment motion by Ulster County Golden
Hill Health Care Center, Judge Homer of the U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of New York finds that Gail
Becker established enough evidence to go to trial on her
claims of sexual harassment based on a hostile work
environment and retaliation under Title VII of the 1964
Civil Rights Act and other laws.

Her evidence surrounding the assault incident--including her
supervisor's failure to allow Becker to call the police and
the facility's refusal to allow her time off to seek a
protective order--if credited, "establishes an incident
sufficient by itself to support a finding that the
conditions of her employment were irrevocably altered as a
result and that those conditions became abusive," the court
holds. . . . Page A-2

FED FINDS MANY REGIONS REBOUNDING FROM SEPTEMBER

The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington stunted
economic growth throughout the country in September, but
many regions saw activity rebound in recent weeks, the
Federal Reserve reports in its "Beige Book" summary of
economic conditions in each of its 12 districts.

Business activity recovered quickly from some aspects of the
attacks, such as reduced air cargo capacity, but long-run
effects are more difficult to assess, according to the Fed.
New since the attacks, however, are disruptions to
productivity due to increased security precautions and
insurance premiums, the central bank says. . . . Page D-12

I worked with someone on a project that APQC did for us, and he is now looking for a new opportunity (just our of law school). I let him know that Enron doesn't typically hire right out of law school, but was wondering if there might be someone he could talk to about "a day in the life of a corporate lawyer."  Is there someone in particular who handles recruiting for legal?

Thanks for your help!

Joe, Drew,
 
Looks like we are on target for the US roll out.  Following a conference call with our US legal team today, we've determined that Metals US will be able to roll-out a Voluntary Separation Program as planned. Plan documents are being drafted and revised by internal and external counsel now with finalization targetted for end of week.  With this in mind the following is our timeline for roll-out:
 
Thursday, 4:30PM (EST) - Presentation to the staff announcing general details of program
Friday, COB - Plan documents and details of the plan will be e-mailed to employees.
Monday, 22 Oct, Official start of program
Friday, 02 Nov, Official end of program
 
I will copy you in on final versions of the communciations and plan documents once they are ready.
 
If any questions, please advise.
 
Regards,
Cathy

Subject:	EEL Voluntary Severance

Hi Kriste,

Some 'light' reading for you?

For some background, I've attached a memo that Enron Metals North America sent out to our staff on Friday.  We sent it out under the cover of our lead commercial and lead commercial support execs.  It is an acknowledgement and response to a memo sent out by the CEO and COO of EEL announcing their voluntary redundancy program.

 

Further to the memo, my colleagues in London HR have forwarded additional details on how the program will work in London.  These next four attachments contain general information about the program that can also be found on the EEL intranet site.

General information Application for VR VR Q&A UK VR Calculation 


EEL plans on running the VR Program for 2 weeks starting today.  Following this 2 week program, they will then start a compulsory redundancy program with payout under the statutory requirements.  In preparation for this, each business unit will need to follow a selection process within each group to identify key employees.
Here in North America, we are going through the same selection process.  Attached is the selection guide and an example spreadsheets we are using.  

    

As much as we can, we want to offer a voluntary program in the US as well.  Doing so will help us send a unified global message within EEL; US employees will not be treated any different then their London colleagues.  However, as I noted in our telecon, our current involuntary severance is quite generous already and I can't imagine padding it even more.  I ran a quick calculation and based on the yrs of service employees carried over form MG, over 75% of our North America staff would eligible for over 4 months of severance.  There is a long history of tenure in Metals and the average time of service is 7 yrs.

Seems the selection process and criteria would also work for us in the US, as long as we apply it consistently, but I would welcome your thoughts.

Once you've had a chance to review it, please call me and we can discuss it further.

Thanks
Cathy

I have spoken to Cathy and she has gone through most of the documents, she is passing them by legal and has done some basic calculations to ascertain whether it would be attractive to her employee base. 

Cathy will also try and get Philip and Marcello to look at the criteria to see if that works for their population before they come over here.  I think Cathy will be ready as soon as she needs to be.

The attached memo is to be distributed to all US-based employees this afternoon.  We've opted to include the various changes to HR policies and employee programs in one consolidated memo to reduce the number of negative e-mails employees receive over the next few weeks.  Please review at your earliest convenience and provide changes to me.  If  I do not receive changes from you by 3:30 p.m. today, I will assume you have none.

I don't know if he went to Valeria. Lizzette, why don't you call her to find out status. I still think that termination this quickly after he raised discrim claims is a bit risky but if he is not doing his job then I think we should document it well and communicate with his agency to have it tell him that he must be there.

Lizzette's changes to the plan document look good to me. 
When the plan document is finalized, we will prepare unanimous consent resolutions for adoption by the board of directors of the two participating employers.  It has always been the Enron practice to have an employer's board of directors approve such a plan for purposes of corporate governance.

Michelle,

Welcome back from you vacation.  Attached is the contract between Enron and Indeliq, the attorney on this project is Ed Steakley out of Fulbright.  We need your comments on Indemnity to make sure that Enron is fine with it or if there is a need for changes.
Do you have the time to come back with review by Friday or do you want some one else to look at it? 
this is one of the outstanding issues that we need Enron Legal to review as soon as possible, but I understand you are trying to cutch up, so by Friday would work for me if it is ok with you.

Regards,

Yevgeny

It appears complex. I suggest finding someone at Enron who has no experience
with the deal and see if they can use the formulae. Point to the section,
but don't give them any background.

If you could send me a copy i would appreciate it.

Also, the engineering constuction IR issue at Lundbeck chemicals, over 2nd tier payments, is, according to my sources unlikely to spread to other sites. However if you have any 'intelligence' on this subject, i would appreciate a call or an e-mail.

WISCONSIN APPEALS COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE NO-HIRE AGREEMENT

A Wisconsin supplier of physical therapists cannot enforce a
no-hire agreement with a group of nursing homes, which was
entered into without the therapists' knowledge or consent,
the Wisconsin Court of Appeals decides, addressing an issue
of first impression ("Heyde Cos., d/b/a Greenbriar
Rehabilitation v. Dove Healthcare LLC, "Wis. Ct. App., No.
01-0863, 10/23/01). Under agreements between supplier
Greenbriar Rehabilitation and 34 nursing homes, including
Dove Healthcare, Greenbriar provided physical therapists.
The nursing homes were prohibited from hiring Greenbriar
therapists without the supplier's consent. If Greenbriar
consented, the nursing home had to pay the supplier a steep
fee. Dove hired Greenbriar therapists without seeking the
supplier's consent or paying the fee.

Overturning a $64,314 judgment for Greenbriar, the appeals
court decides the no-hire provision is unenforceable because
it violates Wisconsin public policy favoring unrestrained
competition in the employment market. "We conclude that an
employee's individual right and freedom to contract may not
be restricted by a contract between two employers unless the
employee is aware of and consents to the contract," Judge
Peterson says. . . . Page AA-1

NINTH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS $1 MILLION DAMAGES AWARD IN RACE BIAS
CASE

A company's failure to respond to co-workers' harassment of
its only African American employee was negligence and
evidence of remedial efforts would not have altered the
significant finding against the employer, the Ninth Circuit
holds ("Swinton v. Potomac Corp. d/b/a Crescent Cardboard
Co. d/b/a Crescent/U.S. Mat, "9th Cir., No. 99-36147,
10/24/01).

Ruling on an appeal by manufacturer U.S. Mat, which was
found liable for racial harassment in a claim by Troy
Swinton, the Ninth Circuit upholds a $1 million punitive
damages award. In doing so, the court refuses to create a
bright-line rule requiring trial courts to admit evidence of
remedial efforts undertaken after the filing of a
discrimination complaint. The court also rules that the
affirmative defense to employer liability established by the
U.S. Supreme Court in "Faragher v. Boca Raton " and
"Burlington Industries Inc. v. Ellerth " is not available to
employers when the harasser is not the plaintiff's
supervisor and the plaintiff is alleging negligence. . . .

UNION SECRETARY'S WRONGFUL DISCHARGE CLAIM PREEMPTED BY
LMRDA

A local union secretary in Southern California who was fired
for her support of Proposition 226--a 1998 anti-labor voter
initiative that the union had fought--is barred from
bringing a wrongful discharge action against the United Food
and Commercial Workers union, a state appeals court holds
("Thunderburk v. UFCW Local 324, "Cal. Ct. App., No.
E029765, 10/22/01).

Plaintiff Nattie Thunderburk had access to a wide range of
confidential union information, which if disclosed "could
have thwarted union policies and objectives, " according to
the California Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate
District. "[D]espite limitations normally imposed on
employers by California's wrongful termination law," UFCW
Local 324, therefore had an "unfettered right to terminate
confidential employees" like Thunderburk under the
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. . . .

COURT OKS $350,000 AWARD FOR WORKER PHOTOGRAPHED IN REST
ROOM

The California appeals court upholds a $350,000 verdict for
an auto body repair shop production manager who sued his
employer after co-workers broke into the office rest room,
took a photograph of him while he was urinating, and showed
the photo to other employees who then subjected him to
ribald and humiliating comments ("Fotiades v. Hi-Tech Auto
Collision & Painting Servs. Inc.,  "Cal. Ct. App.,  No.
E029854,  "unpublished" 10/17/01).

The trial court properly reduced the jury's original $1
million compensatory damages award to $350,000 on Chris
Fotiades's invasion of privacy and intentional infliction of
emotional distress claims against Hi-Tech Auto Collision &
Painting Services Inc., Justice Richli rules in the
unpublished opinion.  But the appeals court strikes down the
trial court's $150,000 punitive damages award, finding
insufficient evidence that a director, officer, or managing
agent of Hi-Tech either participated in, authorized, or
ratified the employees' outrageous conduct. . . . Page A-9

UNILATERAL WORK-POLICY CHANGES FOLLOWING UNION ELECTION
VIOLATED NLRA

The National Labor Relations Board's determination that
numerous unfair labor practices took place at Pepsi Cola
Bottling Co.'s Fayetteville, N.C., plant following a
successful 1991 union representation election is endorsed by
the Fourth Circuit ("NLRB v. Pepsi Cola Bottling Co. of
Fayetteville Inc., "4th Cir., No. 00-1969, 10/12/01). In the
latest development in a longstanding labor dispute, the
Fourth Circuit agrees to enforce an NLRB bargaining order
based on the board's showing that Pepsi violated the
National Labor Relations Act by unilaterally changing
various employment policies following the election.

The court rejects Pepsi's contention that the United Food
and Commercial Workers waived its right to bargain over the
unilateral policy changes, which included new compensation
procedures, altered work schedules, and stricter
disciplinary procedures. Given a UFCW representative's
testimony that she received notice of the proposed changes
after they were announced to employees, the court concludes
the union did not waive its right to bargain over the
changes by failing to request bargaining. It also finds that
the changes amounted to "material alterations of the terms
and conditions of employment" and that Pepsi violated the
NLRA by unilaterally imposing them. . . . Page A-3

	Mike Golden is flexible after November 9, 2001 until the end of the year for his deposition.  I believe he was on the original second list requested by Hetzel; however, we have discussed noticing him ourselves.

	Marni Cosse is flexible after November 17, 2001 until the end of the year for her deposition.  She was originally included in the second list requested by Hetzel; however, Glover indicated to you he no longer wants to take her deposition but we may notice it.  This will be at our costs and Marnie is willing to come based on the representation that she can expense the flight as she is still employed until November 15, 2001 and I will take care of the hotel.

	Chad Beers is in the process of transferring to Houston and can be available any time.

	Michelle is checking with Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to round up the second list of requested deponents.

The suggested comment below already is in the FAQ's on the intranet, with two exceptions: (1) stating that we don't comment on litigation; and (2)  "In general, however, any severance waiver signed will include a release of claims for any and all conduct that has occurred to date."  As such, I think we could safely respond by telling folks that we don't comment on litigation and then referring them to the FAQ questions on severance.  

For now, let's not post.

Subject:	RE: A Question

Here is my suggested response:
Enron's policy is to not comment on current litigation.  With respect to severance, if an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern.  No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.  In general, however, any severance waiver signed will include a release of claims for any and all conduct that has occurred to date.  Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts, including with respect to waiver requirements.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

Alice:

We need to change the header on the invoices you are forwarding to Michelle Cash.  Beginning immediately, the invoices should be addressed as follows:

Company Name   - Codes
Margaret Daffin, EID # 10004155
c/o Michelle Cash
P. O. Box 4734
Houston, Texas 77210-4734

Margaret will be reviewing and coding these invoices.  Michelle will provide a second review and approval on an as-needed basis.

Thanks for all your help.  I have enjoyed working with you.

Michelle,

It looks like my contacts have added more than one addition to our list of
possible Enron employees.  I am forwarding on this complete list w/ 25 more
possible employees to search.  Can you let us know if these people were
Enron employees and their dates of employment?   Sorry, I didn't send this
list with the request yesterday, but it was not generated at the time of
the request.

Thank you,
Kevin Kosub

My name is Jim Little.  I am a forth year Enron employee and a third year student at South Texas College of Law.

I am writing in response to a posting with your group for a Sr. Legal Specialist.  The posting itself contains no information about the job other than the fact that it is in the Labor and Employment Department.  I realize the expectation may be that I contact the recruiter directly; however, I felt efficiency would be served in contacting you directly.  I would appreciate any information you may provide including both duties and necessary qualifications.  

I would also appreciate you considering speaking with me in the near future concerning a paper I am writing about individuals with HIV and the protections they are afforded under the ADA.  I feel comfortable that Enron has addressed this issue and I am merely guessing that you would have been involved in such discussion or have familiarity through your various writings on the ADA.  I am still researching the topic, so it will be a few weeks before I would feel able to ask intelligent questions.  But I would appreciate knowing at this time if this is something you are able and willing to discuss.  

Thank you for your time,

Jim Little

Looks fine to me.

Any word on the Saralux stuff?

Either way, I am ready to execute the agreement.

We need to know the employment status of one additional person.  Can you
let us know whether "Lea Fastow" was an Enron employee and what her dates
of employment are if she was?

   Thanks for the information, however I have a question for the 14

   individuals in which we have "No record in SAP".   Do we know for
   certain

   that these individuals where not employed with Enron , or is it that
   there

   is no record of them in SAP HR.  Would a query out of the HR
   datawarehouse

   tell us more information?

Kathy, do you think you need to attend? Dick can be in person or on the phone, although an in-person meeting may be preferable.

Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I spoke with Bonnie this morning and her inquiry is underway but not quite wrapped up.  I'll check in with her again to see what her progress is.

I hate to keep bugging you, but I wondered if you had a readout of Bonnie's investigation?  It is not getting better here with Jonathan.  I  called his agency to alert them to some of the issues we discussed (i.e. taking long breaks and leaving the office for appointments outside of his job).  I suspect they have spoken to him because now we are getting emails every time he leaves his desk and every time he returns.  

I would, more than anything, like to replace him before we get into the thick of the PRC process, and I am anxious to know what the outcome of the inquiry is so that I may consider options.   

Thanks in advance, 
Gina

I would appreciate your help in communicating to the HR community that signed waivers related to the revocation of job offers are to be placed in two locations:  (1) original to the vault; and (2) a copy to the application file kept by HR regarding the individual.

Thanks,

NLRB RULES 2-1 STORE ILLEGALLY URGED OWNER TO ASK PICKETERS
TO MOVE

A Missouri health food store committed an unfair labor
practice by telling the owner of a strip shopping center
that union representatives were picketing and handbilling in
a common area in front of the store, the National Labor
Relations Board ruled 2-1 ("Wild Oats Markets Inc., "336
N.L.R.B. No. 14, 9/28/01 [released 10/16/01]). The shopping
center owner asked the union representatives to move and,
when they refused, called the police. Members Liebman and
Truesdale find the store's actions were "an indirect attempt
to expel the union representatives and, consequently,
constituted interference with employee Section 7 rights"
under the National Labor Relations Act.

Rejecting Wild Oats Markets Inc.'s explanation that it
simply called the owner to ask about the mall's
no-solicitation policy, the board finds the store already
knew about the policy, which was in the lease agreement, and
had never called the owner about solicitation or
distribution activities by numerous nonunion organizations
in front of the store. Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen
maintains the store did not ask the owner to take any action
and therefore was not responsible for what the owner did. .

'MAILBOX RULE' APPLIES TO ERISA, SPLIT NINTH CIRCUIT RULES

A retirement plan administrator for Bank of America acted
arbitrarily in refusing to apply the common law "mailbox
rule" to a participant's claim that she had mailed her
lump-sum distribution election form, the Ninth Circuit rules
in a 2-1 decision ("Schikore v. BankAmerica Supplemental
Retirement Plan, "9th Cir., No. 99-16952, 10/16/01). The
function of the mailbox rule in the context of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act "is to provide employees with
a guarantee that, if the retirement plan claims not to have
received a document that an employee mailed, the document
will nevertheless be presumed to have been received by the
plan unless the plan can produce probative evidence of
non-receipt," the majority says.

In denying the participant's request for a lump-sum
distribution, the plan administrator found that the common
law "mailbox rule," which creates a rebuttable presumption
of receipt upon proof of proper mailing, was inapplicable in
the context of ERISA. The dissent contends that the plan
administrator did not abuse its discretion in declining to
follow the mailbox rule because the plan "explicitly states
that the election form must be "received," not mailed, in
order to be effective." . . . Page A-1 , Text-E-14

FUGITIVE FROM JUSTICE CAN PROCEED WITH FLSA CASE, EIGHTH
CIRCUIT SAYS

A former Missouri prisoner who was on the lam from a work
release assignment could still proceed with his suit against
the YMCA for paying him only $1 an hour in violation of the
Fair Labor Standards Act, according to the Eighth Circuit
("Barnett v. Young Men's Christian Ass'n Inc., "8th Cir.,
No. 01-1211, 10/15/01).

 After Matthew Barnett walked away from a halfway house in
violation of his parole, a federal court in Kansas City
dismissed his case under the fugitive from justice rule,
concluding that he had disrupted the court's schedule
because of his extended absence.

Reviving the FLSA claim, the Eighth Circuit holds that
although he was a fugitive "there is no substantial
connection between Barnett's fugitive status and his current
civil action." The lower court's concerns of "inconvenience"
are baseless, the appeals court adds. "The district court
was in no way inhibited from setting a trial date or ruling
on the motions before it at the time of Barnett's escape and
subsequent return. His physical presence as a civil litigant
was not required at that time." . . . Page A-1

JUDGE ORDERS GARMENT MAKERS TO NOTIFY  25,000 WORKERS OF
RIGHT TO SUE

A federal district judge in the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands orders 22 Saipan garment manufacturers to
notify up to 25,000 current and former foreign guestworkers
that they are entitled to join a class action suit against
the employers for allegedly violating federal and local wage
and hour laws ("Does I v. Advance Textile Corp.,  "D. Mar.
I.,  No. CV-99-0002,  "motion granted" 10/16/01 ).

Judge Munson of the U.S. District Court for the Northern
Mariana Islands grants the plaintiffs' motion asking the
court to approve the distribution of notices to the workers
eligible to join the suit. Munson orders the defendants to
turn over the names and addresses of the current and former
nonresident workers and to post in the factories notices
informing potential plaintiffs--those who have worked in the
factories since January 1995--that they can join the
lawsuit. According to the order, plaintiffs' counsel will
mail the notices to workers no longer employed at the
factories. . . . Page A-8

NEWLY BARGAINED WAGES IN MANUFACTURING  UP 3.1 PERCENT, BNA
DATA SHOW

Data compiled by BNA in the first 42 weeks of 2001 show that
the weighted average first-year wage increase in newly
negotiated contracts in the manufacturing industry was 3.1
percent, compared with 3.2 percent in the same period of
2000. Nonmanufacturing contracts, excluding construction
agreements, showed a weighted average gain of 3.9 percent,
compared with 4 percent in 2000, and a median of 3.8
percent, compared with 3.5 percent a year ago.

Among new settlements reported in the latest biweekly report
are a three-year contract between Nabisco Inc. and the
Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers,
which raises pay for more than 4,000 workers by 45 cents per
hour in the first year, and an agreement with the
Communications Workers of America, covering some 56,000
employees of BellSouth Corp., that provides wage increase
totaling more than 12 percent over a three-year contract
term. . . . Page D-1 , D-2

 October 17, 2001  Work & Family  <http://interactive.wsj.com/documents/cen=
ter-WorkFamily.htm > Fumbling in Crisis Has Bruised The Loyalty of Some Emp=
loyees By SUE SHELLENBARGER              =20
IN HER EIGHT years at a Pennsylvania medical-services company, the marketin=
g manager had been fairly content. Then, in a relative heartbeat -- the thr=
ee days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- her opinion of her employer=
 did an about-face. The reason: Her bosses fumbled the crisis, the manager =
says. Though nearly all offices and schools in her city closed early Sept. =
11, employees at her firm who had to leave early to pick up children or for=
 other reasons met a snide or grudging response. One senior executive said,=
 "If you really need to, you can," the manager says. Those who stayed but k=
ept one eye on the TV news were criticized for failing to focus. Managers e=
xpressed no concern for employees' worries about traveling on business. "I =
expected much more compassion," says the marketing manager. The experience =
has her considering jumping ship for another employer, she says. Handling t=
he aftermath of the terrorist attacks posed an acid test for employers, oft=
en fundamentally changing the employer-employee relationship. The mass emot=
ions aroused by the tragedy were so primal -- fear, grief, anger and the dr=
ive to protect loved ones -- that any managerial missteps took on larger-th=
an-life importance. EMPLOYEES, RIGHTLY or wrongly, believed they were seein=
g bosses' true colors. Their conclusions about what they saw either deepene=
d their commitment or damaged it beyond repair. "This is a sea change. Peop=
le are seeing how important basic, trustworthy relationships are," says Fre=
derick Reichheld, a director emeritus of Bain & Co. and author of "Loyalty =
Rules." Some employers rose to the occasion. Lorna Paine, a sales executive=
 in Houston for Business Objects, a San Jose, Calif., software concern, say=
s her managers, from the chief executive on down, encouraged people "to go =
home to our families, do whatever you need to do" after the attack. One vic=
e president called Ms. Paine to give her his home number in case she needed=
 anything. "I've been working for almost 20 years. I've never had a vice pr=
esident give me his home number. Never," she says. "I am committed to this =
company like never before." At Trane Co., Doug Young, an asset management s=
pecialist, says his employer's concern for employees, reflected in frequent=
 e-mails, an outpouring of encouragement and educational materials, and big=
 charitable contributions, deepened his commitment. Calling it his personal=
 "moment of truth," Mr. Young says his employer "provided comfort and made =
me proud." Others fumbled the ball. At a Chicago consulting firm, a senior =
supervisor coldly ordered employees on Sept. 11 to return to business as us=
ual, one consultant there says. "What we needed was to stop and say, 'OK, w=
e're going to take a deep breath and think about this,' " she adds. When sh=
e weighs long-term plans, "I will remember this situation and how my firm d=
ealt with it." If employees seem a little touchy, they are. As discussed la=
st month in this column, the terrorist crisis knocked millions of workers a=
 rung or two lower on the Maslovian hierarchy of human needs. Now, they're =
focused on life's most basic requirements, including safety, security and c=
onnections with others. These spark far stronger emotions than the higher-l=
evel priorities of months past, such as recognition or achievement. VAULT.C=
OM, a Web site that posts message boards on companies, drew about 50 postin=
gs from employees protesting their postattack treatment, says Vault Inc.'s =
Mark Oldman. Hundreds more came from human-resource managers asking for adv=
ice. Indeed, several companies found themselves pilloried in the news media=
 for simply following established policies -- for example, requiring employ=
ees to account for time off taken Sept. 11. Embedded in the crisis is an op=
portunity for employers to rebuild damaged loyalty. Fewer than one in four =
workers are truly loyal to their companies and committed to staying, says W=
alker Information, a customer- and employee-satisfaction researcher in Indi=
anapolis. That could easily change. In an unusual twist, Walker received an=
 e-mail request from an employee of one of its clients, a telecommunication=
s company, to change the survey she had submitted about her employer. Her c=
ompany handled the Sept. 11 crisis so well, the employee wrote, that she wa=
nted to express her newfound loyalty. While loyalty may not seem to matter =
amid hundreds of thousands of layoffs, research suggests it does. Loyalty s=
hapes people's choices not only about where to work, but also about how lon=
g, hard and wholeheartedly to apply their mental energies -- the fuel that =
drives the New Economy. Employee attitudes also color customer relationship=
s. "When the only thing keeping employees on the job is fear, or golden han=
dcuffs, those employees don't go the extra mile," Walker's Mark Drizin says=
. In a reeling economy, going the extra mile is just what employers need. B=
ut they're going to have to show some heart to get there. To lead well in t=
imes like these, says Bob Rosner, a speaker on workplace issues and author =
of "The Boss's Survival Guide," "you have to feel the pain yourself." ? Sen=

Andrea,
 
I have talked this issue over with Mary and Kathy.  Apparently, the HR info is limited significantly, and there is sensitivity over keeping HR PRC data on as narrow a scope as possible.  
 
I have a solution, though.   If you could give Kathy the data fields and setup for the data that you have gathered, she can obtain the data, give it to me, and then I can give it to Jeanerette and Associates.  That way, the data can be analyzed, which I believe does add some value to the analysis, but we can continue to protect the confidentiality of that information within HR.
 
Do you have the rest of the data for me to send to Jeanerette?  If so, please get it to me so that they can get started.
 
Thanks.
 
Michelle

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.    

Thanks. ay

Cathy:  please see the following response from Alice Gruber:

IMMIGRATION MATTERS

Q: I've been working for Enron under a US work permit.  How will my
immigration status be affected when my employment ceases?


A:  Your work permit is specific to Enron and is not transferable to
any other employer without additional processing by the INS.  A
non-immigrant (H-1B, L-1, TN, etc.) is out of status once s/he has been
terminated.  Once the non-immigrant is out of status, in theory, s/he should
depart the US as soon as possible.  If the non-immigrant can find a new
employer and file within approximately 30 to 60 days from the date of
termination, the INS has generally overlooked the violation of the
maintenance of status.  Keep in mind this is not a hard and fast rule, and
the INS has the ability to enforce shorter or longer periods on a
case-by-case basis.

If you are offered another job in the US your prospective employer
will have to apply for a new work permit on your behalf.
If you do not get another job in the US and you wish to remain here
then you must seek permission to stay on other grounds.

Upon termination, the foreign national should contact an attorney and
schedule a time for a full consultation (in-person whenever possible)
regarding all issues.  There are often many issues which need to be
addressed as each person's immigration issues are unique.


I hope this is what you are looking for.  Let me know if we need anything else?
Thanks
Margaret

It has been communicated that the vacation policy has, indeed, been approved by the Board Of Directors.  What needs to happen now is that a true cost estimate needs to be provided to the HR Heads (David Oxley?) so that funding for the system changes can be obtained.

ISC -- please put together a project scope document to configure SAP to do the following:

Vacation accrual will occur for all employees as it does now for new hires their first year.
Only 40 hours of "automatic" carryover will be allowed.  Any additional vacation carryover must be approved.
Employees will be able to go into vacation arrears up to their maximum entitlement for the year, plus any carryover.

I know this doesn't cover all of the details, but wanted to give you as much as I knew.  Please let me know when you'd like to get a meeting together to go over complete requirements, and I'll help pull that meeting together.

Payroll -- from a process perspective, it is my understanding that we will take as much overpayment as possible from the final payroll check.  It would probably be helpful to document how that process is carried out, and then put together a proposal on how it could be handled in the future -- TPC?  HR Rep?, etc.

Please let me know if anyone needs any additional information at this time; otherwise, I'll wait to hear from the ISC on when they'd like to get the requirements-gathering session put together.

Thanks.
Jo Ann

Michelle,

On the INS forms, there are two places which refer to:

Gross Annual Income:	$100 billion
Net Annual Income:		$979 million		

Currently when Tindall & Foster are completing the forms they use our annual report to complete these.  Would you advise if we should revised these with the recent events and include the appropriate statement/restatement with the annual report we submit?  Or continue utilizing only the annual reports and the figures held within?

Thank you.

	After we spoke, I was in a meeting with Michelle Cash and we discussed the prospect of implementing the Voluntary severance  program in the U.S.
 She advised me that she would be meeting with David Oxley in the a.m. and would discuss this matter with him. We both agreed that we should hold off on conforming  edits to the Europe's Voluntary severance program until we have confirmation that that is the direction we are going in the U.S.  Additionally, there are legal issue that we need to address relating to  New York and in California law relating to the  implementation of this plan and its administration for your company that would take a day or so to address with outside counsel, as well.  Likewise, the calculation of severance as it relates to this program in the U.S. needs to be addressed before we can conform the document for use.  Accordingly, I will wait to hear from Michelle in the a.m. and will contact you as soon as I know the proposed direction of the Company for U.S. based employees and other detail.

Thanks,

Kriste

Hi Kriste,

Some 'light' reading for you?

For some background, I've attached a memo that Enron Metals North America sent out to our staff on Friday.  We sent it out under the cover of our lead commercial and lead commercial support execs.  It is an acknowledgement and response to a memo sent out by the CEO and COO of EEL announcing their voluntary redundancy program.

 << File: A Message from Philip Bacon and Marcelo Parra.doc >> 

Further to the memo, my colleagues in London HR have forwarded additional details on how the program will work in London.  These next four attachments contain general information about the program that can also be found on the EEL intranet site.

General information << File: Document R-2 081001 UK.doc >> Application for VR << File: Document R-3 email versionsk071001 UK.doc >> VR Q&A << File: Document R-5 071001 FAQS UK.doc >> UK VR Calculation << File: Document R-4 051001 UK.xls >> 


EEL plans on running the VR Program for 2 weeks starting today.  Following this 2 week program, they will then start a compulsory redundancy program with payout under the statutory requirements.  In preparation for this, each business unit will need to follow a selection process within each group to identify key employees.
Here in North America, we are going through the same selection process.  Attached is the selection guide and an example spreadsheets we are using.  

 << File: R1-b GUIDANCE NOTES FOR CRITERIA SPREADSHEET 2.doc >>    << File: Criteria.xls >> 

As much as we can, we want to offer a voluntary program in the US as well.  Doing so will help us send a unified global message within EEL; US employees will not be treated any different then their London colleagues.  However, as I noted in our telecon, our current involuntary severance is quite generous already and I can't imagine padding it even more.  I ran a quick calculation and based on the yrs of service employees carried over form MG, over 75% of our North America staff would eligible for over 4 months of severance.  There is a long history of tenure in Metals and the average time of service is 7 yrs.

Seems the selection process and criteria would also work for us in the US, as long as we apply it consistently, but I would welcome your thoughts.

Once you've had a chance to review it, please call me and we can discuss it further.

Thanks
Cathy

I have spoken to Cathy and she has gone through most of the documents, she is passing them by legal and has done some basic calculations to ascertain whether it would be attractive to her employee base. 

Cathy will also try and get Philip and Marcello to look at the criteria to see if that works for their population before they come over here.  I think Cathy will be ready as soon as she needs to be.

The Global Performance Management Team is gearing up to train both you and your business unit clients for the Year End Performance Management Process.  Please carefully read the information below:

HR COMMUNITY TRAINING
The Global Performance Management Team will be separating the HR training for YE2001 into two different courses during the week of October 29 - 31.  One course provides information on the YE2001 philosophy shift and deliverables while the second course will cover technical know-how on the PEP application.  Make sure you are in the know!

HR GENERALIST TRAINING will be customized by Business Unit to reflect the criteria that the BU and HR lead have determined will define the Performance Management Process for the respective BU and your attendance is required.

There is no action required on your part at this time to enroll in the Generalist class.  You will be sent information regarding your Business Unit's scheduled class under separate cover. If you are traveling to Houston for this class and you wish to combine your visit for PEP SYSTEM TRAINING, please let your Performance Management Advisor know.
 
PEP SYSTEM TRAINING will focus on technical know-how of the PEP system and is a hands-on class for those who are new to the application or wish to refresh their skills.  The system classes will be held on November 1 and  2.  To enroll in the system course, contact Allyson Zykorie now at x35210 to avoid disappointment!

EMPLOYEE TRAINING
Good news!  For the first time, the Global Performance Management Team has partnered with the Organizational Development and Training Team to design and deliver Performance Management training for employees and supervisors. These classes will be conducted in Houston, and it is anticipated that employee and supervisor training will occur in the week beginning November 5, 2001.  Online tutorials and training material will be available to all via the PEP home page.  

Your Performance Management Advisor will be contacting you to discuss the details of how the training courses will be rolled out to your clients with your assistance, and we ask that you please take some time to consider the best approach for your particular client groups in advance. 

There are significant changes to the Performance Management Process and a critical success factor of this process is the full inclusion and education of your client groups.  We will be asking HR Reps to make themselves available to attend these classes to help answer questions during each training session.

Thank you for your patience as we roll out the details of the process for YE2001.

Global Performance Management Team

Kelly, 
A part of the Management Committee presentation, we will need the DATA as part of 'business case'.  Michelle Cash and I have discussed using Jeanerette to calculate the standard deviations.  I was hoping to get the clearance from Mary Joyce to prepare and provide the data.  As you can see, from the original note of Oct. 8th I am at a standstill and am positive I cannot get this information turned around, analyzed and ready as a part of the presentation by Friday noon, per your request.

So I will prepare a proposed presentation without the data.  I hope to get this resolved shortly.   Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.

Do any of you have any forms or checklists that you use in reviewing proposed transactions to identify labor & employment issues as part of the due diligence process?

Cole, I have passed these on to Kriste for final blessing.  I looked at these briefly, however, and would question whether we want these answers out for everyone to see.  I think that some of these questions really should be for internal HR only.  My guess is that David probably should decide what and how much he wants to raise in the public.  Thanks.  Michelle

Mr. Herndon,

I met with Messrs Hector McLoughlin and Scott Mills on Friday.  Per Mr. McLoughlin, my position in your group has not "materialized," which is not an elimination of position.  I was offered 30 days (calendar days) to look for a position within Enron, and, at the conclusion of that period, if I do not secure a position, I would be given one month of pay for a separation agreement.  [The terms of the separation agreement was not presented to me.]  The meeting was intimidating and humiliating.

Mr. McLoughlin stated that the management (Beth Apollo and Scott Mills) is giving me this ultimatum.  I am about to be unemployed in a depressed economy with one month of pay.

None of the participants in the Friday meeting was able to clarify the difference between elimination of a position versus a position that did not "materialize."  Perhaps you can explain the difference to me.  I believe ordinary and prudent Americans would see this as an elimination my job at Enron.

Query: Can you tell me why my position in your group has been eliminated?  

Query: Why am I being treated differently versus some of the other members of Risk Analysis such as Brian Butler, who was awarded a position in your group?  Why am I not offered the standard severance package but given an abbreviated version?  Simply, why am I not treated fairly?

Query: Do you believe I have been treated fairly?  My position with a commercial organization has been eliminated, and I am a pariah in commercial support organization.  I do not have a fair chance at year-end PRC even if I land a position at Enron.  I face an uncertain future near the end of the year in an highly uncertain and depressed economy without employment.  

What I rightfully deserve as a loyal employee of Enron for the past three and a half years is what other Enron employees are entitled to and have received.  I do not see a single shred of reason why I should be treated differently than other employees of Enron.  I believe I deserve the standard severance package that other Enron employees receive when their position has been eliminated.

Finally, I would like to present some thoughts before I close.  Mr. McLoughlin mentioned the term, "employment at-will."  Yes, I understand what that term represents.  I am perfectly content with that term as long as the term is interpreted and applied to me as it is interpreted and applied to other Enron employees.  Yes, I am a weak person in front of mighty Enron management, but I am a human being.  I deserve respect like everyone else at Enron.  I believe I am due the response to my inquiry.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,

Michael S. Kim

Michelle -

Kim and I will be speaking with Jubran at 4:00 pm today.  If it is OK, I would like to offer COBRA costs of $7500 gross (current expenses for benefits are about $700).  Is this OK?

Also, with regards to section 5.3 of this agreement, can we add a clause that says he will be compensated for his time if needed to assist with litigation issues.....not sure if we have done this in the past, however, he has raised this as a concern.

Thanks!
Amy

	Dorie and Michelle,

	This will update you on the latest developments.  Bob and I are working on finding a solution that resolves all the issues, which get complex, due to the fact that not only has the Hilton made claims against Enron, but also against Event Resources in the bankruptcy proceeding.  In other words, even if we succeed in facing down the Hilton on its claims directly against us, the Hilton may be able to recover some percentage of those claims directly from Event Resources in the bankruptcy proceeding, reducing the overall amount other creditors, such as Enron, can recover from Event Resources.  You will recall that Enron is trying to recover $225,000 that it advanced to Event Resources for the 2000 ENA Holiday Party.

	Bob will be speaking with Cindy Olson, his client, about what she would be willing to do in the way of future events.  

	Once he hears back,  we will speak with you about the best way of resolving the Hilton's claim against us for the Torrey Pines/La Jolla event, which the Hilton's attorney appears more interested in than the Hilton's claim against Enron for the San Antonio/Palacio Del Rio event.  This is reportedly because the Hilton was actually provided the services for the Torrey Pines/La Jolla event.  As you know, we actually paid Event Resources for that event, and think we have a good position regarding not having to pay anything further.  Again, however, we need to keep in mind (a) if the Hilton sues us directly, we will incur attorneys' fees even in successfully defending the claim (perhaps we could file a dec. action to offset that risk) and (b) the Hilton clearly has a great claim against Event Resources for the Torrey Pines/La Jolla event, putting at risk some portion of the $225,000 we are seeking to recover.

	Also, please be advised that George Neeson, a Hilton v-p in charge of building infrastructure contracts, has recently contacted Ron Menton of EES, which has several such contracts with the Hilton, asking that Menton ensure that this matter be given the proper attention so that it can be resolved.  I have already spoken to Ron about this and will also speak with his EES attorney, Sarah Dietrich.  According to Menton, Neeson is not indicating that our legal issues are imperilling any present or future deals, and Menton (in response to my specific question) is not taking the position that we have to resolve these issues other than based on our own straight-up legal analysis.

	 I will keep you advised.

	Britt

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Hey Gang:

Dave's staff meeting was attended by women in a party mood and Kirk with some limited veto rights!  We have tentatively scheduled a casual family Christmas party for Dave's Gang for December 8 at Alicia's house in the Heights.  This is a kid-friendly event with a street party twist - we'll start with a casual dinner at 5pm at the Goodrows then, weather permitting, travel by foot, wagon, stroller, bicycles, scooters or similar modes to the Lights in the Heights Street Party a few blocks away.

We'll send out better invitations next week.  But please mark your calendars and inform your household event coordinators now.

Check out the attached link to Lights in the Heights for more info about carolling and carousing for Christmas!

Subject: North America Voluntary Separation Roll-out


Joe, Drew,
 
Looks like we are on target for the US roll out.  Following a conference call with our US legal team today, we've determined that Metals US will be able to roll-out a Voluntary Separation Program as planned. Plan documents are being drafted and revised by internal and external counsel now with finalization targetted for end of week.  With this in mind the following is our timeline for roll-out:
 
Thursday, 4:30PM (EST) - Presentation to the staff announcing general details of program
Friday, COB - Plan documents and details of the plan will be e-mailed to employees.
Monday, 22 Oct, Official start of program
Friday, 02 Nov, Official end of program
 
I will copy you in on final versions of the communciations and plan documents once they are ready.
 
If any questions, please advise.
 
Regards,
Cathy

As soon as we receive notice to move ahead, generalists will receive a training binder outlining the process of the WARN notifications.  I assume we need to mark these documents as confidential and proprietary.  Is there any specific wording you would like on either a introduction page or as a footer on each page?  Please let me know ASAP so I can finalize the documents.

Thanks - Tana

I like that there is some sort of formal process based on peer group.  
 
I also like that they have made a decision to have ranking in the commercial groups.  It looks like they are being ranked to measure performance, not for compensation.  If so, then it would be nice for there to be some rough correlation to compensation.  If not, then what are the criteria for determining the bonus amounts?  If it is P&L and some other components, then let's specify what they are.  My biggest concern with all of this flexibility is that decisions will appear arbitrary with no clear basis for distinguishing between persons at the top of the bonus range and persons in the bottom.
 
On non-commercial, will there be a further breakdown within the 80?  If so, will those correlate to bonus amounts?  If not, same question as above.
 
I understand that market forces may drive many of these bonus decisions.  If so, then I believe that we simply should articulate them and be prepared to explain the bases for bonus payment amounts.
 
Promotion process looks good.
 
Assistants and clerks looks good, although it looks like OOC will decide bonus amounts.  If this is a fixed amount based on the rating, then that is ok.  Otherwise, if they are not pretty standardized, the same issues arise as above.  I
 
I expect that the same kinds of questions will arise for all business unit plans.
 
Hope this helps.  Let me know if you want to discuss or would like to talk through pay criteria.

Here is our plan on PRC. 

Assistants: 

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings. 

Non Commercial but in North America: 

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC. 

Analysts and Associates 

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC 
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors 

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria. 

VP's 

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay. 

Cheers as you Brits say

14th Court Extends Deadly Weapon Finding
Texas Lawyer
Houston's 14th Court of Appeals may have handed prosecutors another
plea bargaining tool on Oct. 11 when it upheld a jury's finding
that a man found guilty of failing to stop and render aid used a
"deadly weapon" in the commission of the offense. In a 2-1
decision, the court held in Cates v. Texas that a rational jury
could conclude from the evidence that Johnny Weldon Cates II
operated his pickup truck in a manner capable of causing death or
serious injury when he left the scene of a fatal accident that he
caused.

witness is an accomplice to the jury as a fact issue because it was
not clear from the evidence whether the witness was an accomplice.

CRIMINAL LAW - INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL
Blount v. State
In a case alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, the court's
review of counsel's representation is highly deferential; the fact
that another attorney, even the defendant's own attorney on
appeal, might have pursued a different course of action does not
necessarily indicate ineffective assistance. Texarkana Court of
Appeals, No. 06-00-00171-CR; Posted October 24, 2001.

Rob,

I really appreciate your quick response and you calling back as soon as
you had some news on my contracts today.

I was taking an executive course all week at Wharton and I have to admit
I was not fully aware until reading the WSJ today of the full dimensions
of what Enron is going through.

I hope everything is well with you and I will give you a call on Monday
to catch up on everything.

All the best,

Diomedes.

Thanks for the note.  With all due respect, I don't think things have
ever
been like this at Enron.  In any event, the company owes you a response
and
I'll do my best to find out what's going on.

Thanks.

   Rob,

   Thanks. I am copying Jim on the entire exchange.

   I realize things are hectic at Enron but they have been for some time
   now and my payments can no longer be delayed. I think no one wants to
   assume responsibility for this and that's why I am writing to you and
   Jim because the delay is really reaching break point from my
standpoint.
   These are contractually agreed upon payments and they are not days or
   weeks late but MANY MONTHS late. I really need to receive the
payments
   in a matter of days.

   All the best and look forward to hearing from you.

   Diomedes.

      Jim and Rob,

      I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be
      extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself
in
   a
      position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email
below
   to
      your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the
bottom
   line
      is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to
me
      and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not
   even
      responding to my requests for information.

      I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to
   handle
      this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority
to
      make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the
      unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already
   causing
      me serious  problems and potential losses.

      I look forward to your response.

      Thanks and hope to see you soon.

      Diomedes.

      Subject: Enron payments

      Mary Joyce,

      I hope all is well with you.

      I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron
   which
      have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to
      contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate
companies)
   and
      Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The
      payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.

      After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments
   (after
      leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related
to
      the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron
South
      America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe
   works
      with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early
   November,
      maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at
Enron
      require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation
Committee
      which would convene in early or late November".

      As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message
   with
      Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two
   messages
      with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding
this
      very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing
   this
      email to make sure that my position is clear.

      These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I
see
   no
      reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation
      Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I
have
   been
      extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by
   Enron
      up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in
the
      process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these
      payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other
positions
      that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than
   Wednesday,
      October 24.

      Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the
      appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.

      I look forward to hearing from you,

      Regards,


      Diomedes Christodoulou.

Michelle,

On the INS forms, there are two places which refer to:

Gross Annual Income:	$100 billion
Net Annual Income:		$979 million		

Currently when Tindall & Foster are completing the forms they use our annual report to complete these.  Would you advise if we should revised these with the recent events and include the appropriate statement/restatement with the annual report we submit?  Or continue utilizing only the annual reports and the figures held within?

Thank you.

Valeria. This looks good. I would suggest that we tweak the language in the third paragraph to say that we remain willing to provide feedback, instead of saying that we would like to. Also, he last sentence of that paragraph should ask whether she would like to pursue that option instead of asking about her availability. Finally, I would delete the paragraph about lawyers. Thanks.

Hello everyone,

Attached is a summary write-up I've prepared on the EIP Plan (it's origin, current status and why we feel it s/b terminated) to deliver to Mary Joyce for her conversation with Mark Frevert.  I felt it a good idea to summarize all on one piece of papaer  in case Marke Frevert was not familar with the Plan.  This Plan is pretty intense when even intimate with it's details!

Sheila/Michelle, could you pls. both review prior to me delivering to Mary to see if I've missed anything or am describing anything incorrectly.  Pam is out today.  I appreciate it.  After your review I'll deliver.  I feel it's going to be very critical to get Mark's support on this to take it to the "termination" level, so I want this to go smoothly.

I'm also going to dabble around with a few "settlement payout" scenarios, based on the actual fund size, original expectations, remaining participants, etc.  I'll send to you for review and we'll have in our back pocket when it's time to talk to Gene.

Thanks all!

Susan

      Please accept my sincere apology for not being able to join Enron
right now as I had an unavoidable emergency at home that has forced me to
come to India over the weekend.My stay here might stretch to approximately a
month or so.I donot want that the company shall suffer any loss due to my
absense so pls advice accordingly.  Your company offers an invaluable
opportunity, and I would appreciate any consideration you can give me in
rescheduling my joining date after a month.
Pls contact my fiancee Kamal for any urgent issue as I am keeping my
cellphone with her.She would convey the message to me by best means.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

The fact that we specifically elected at the outset of our Green Card Process to proceed down the Consular route was to ensure that notwithstanding the inconvenience of traveling to the UK at relatively short notice, the benefit would be that we would stand a better chance, if we were to receive a Green Card, of receiving one in the shortest possible period of time.
	
I currently have little confidence in Tindall & Foster to be able to deliver on anything now that we are forced to parallel process with the Adjusted Status route. We need to be clear on this, this is not, and never was our preferred route. Unless there is something that provides me with significant comfort that the Consular route is an avenue that we are able to pursue in a timely manner, I would like to re-visit employing Tindall & Foster and would like to consider a firm in either New York or London.

Michelle,

When you were in d.c., i looked at an employment contract that contained a clause listing disability as a basis for termination of our employement agreements.  i had some concerns about the language, and called kriste to check on the clause.  my suggestion was to use language stating that the contract would terminate if the employee could not perform the essential functions of the job, with or without a reasonable accommodation.  kriste, asked me to send her the language.  

i haven't done so yet; you asked me to hold off sending her language until we update our form contracts.  

have you had twanda make the changes to the employment contract form?  did the changes include that language?  and, if so, can T send it to kriste, if she hasn't already?

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

HOUSE, SENATE CONFEREES AGREE ON AIRPORT SECURITY COMPROMISE

House and Senate conferees agree on a compromise airport
security bill that would require baggage screeners to be
federal employees for two years. After two years, the
agreement would allow individual airports to "opt out" of
the federal system if they meet certain standards.  The bill
also allows a one-year transition period after enactment for
airports to move to the federalized system. During the
transition period, the federal government would oversee the
contracting companies that employ current baggage screeners.

Leaders in the Senate and the House have signed off on the
deal, and both chambers are scheduled to vote on the
conference report Nov. 16.  Lawmakers from both parties
expect the bill to pass.

Senate Majority Leader Daschle (D-S.D.) calls the agreement
"a big victory" and says he expects "broad bipartisan
support" for the measure. House Speaker Hastert (R-Ill.)
hails the agreement, noting that in addition to baggage
screeners, it places airline mechanics and food servers
under federal supervision, and it requires federal
supervisors to be present at all boarding gates. . . . Page

SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS CHEMICAL FIRMS MUST ARBITRATE POST-SALE
DISPUTE

A chemical company that sold part of a facility to another
chemical company must arbitrate a union's claim that a
bargaining contract requires the two companies to continue
using a unified seniority list and allow transfers between
the two units, the Seventh Circuit rules ("CK Witco Corp. v.
Paper, Allied-Industrial, and Chemical Employees Local
60-807, "7th Cir., No. 00-3413, 11/9/01). CK Witco Corp. and
the Paper, Allied-Industrial, and Chemical Employees
negotiated a contract covering a facility in Mapleton, Ill.
The contract stated it would be binding upon any purchaser.
Witco sold one of two plants at the facility to Goldschmidt
Chemical Corp. during the term of the contract. The union
objected when the two companies prepared separate seniority
lists and prohibited employee transfers between the two
plants.

Reversing summary judgment for Witco and Goldschmidt, the
appeals court decides the bargaining contract's arbitration
provision covers the dispute. "[T]he employees in each
[plant] possess a contractual entitlement against their
respective current employer to maintenance of the 'full
force and effect' of the [bargaining contract] in the event
of a sale," Judge Williams writes. "The scope of that
entitlement and the attendant duty on the employers is a
matter for the arbitrator to resolve," she says. . . . Page

HOUSE APPROVES RETIREMENT ADVICE MEASURE

The House votes 280-144 to approve legislation that would
allow financial institutions that administer qualified
employer-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans to
provide investment advice to plan participants without
employers being liable for specific advice. The Retirement
Security Advice Act (H.R. 2269) would create a new exemption
from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's
prohibited transaction rules. It would also require
qualified investment advisers--registered financial
institutions and their employees--to disclose to
participants relevant fees and material affiliations with
investment products.

The House rejects by a 243-180 vote a substitute that sought
to address lingering concerns among some Democrats. The
substitute called for model forms for making disclosures,
registration of all financial institution employees that
provide advice, enhanced legal remedies for breach of
fiduciary duty, and the provision of an alternate
independent adviser if the designated adviser has a
potential conflict of interest. . . . Page A-13

MICHIGAN ECONOMISTS EXPECT SHORT RECESSION

The U.S. economy is in a recession that should be short and
shallow, economists at the University of Michigan Economic
Outlook Conference predict. They say they expect lower
interest rates and higher federal spending to pull the
economy out of decline.

Recovery should be under way by next spring, says Saul H.
Hymans, UM professor of economics. "I peg the length of the
recession at two, maybe three quarters," he says. No one
industry will lead the way out of the recession, as growth
resumes during the second quarter of 2002, Hymans says. . .

SURVEY FINDS 63 PERCENT OF EMPLOYERS GRANTING THREE YEAR-END
HOLIDAYS

The calendar bodes well for workers this holiday season, as
Christmas and New Year's Day fall on Tuesdays, giving
employees an excellent shot at some "extra" time off,
according to BNA's latest annual survey of year-end holiday
plans.

More than three out of five surveyed employers (63 percent)
will grant at least three paid days off for the holiday
season, up from 49 percent in 2000-2001, when Christmas and
New Year's Day fell on Mondays. Workers stand a good chance
of enjoying an extended holiday weekend, as a majority of
responding organizations have a full paid day off slated for
Christmas Eve (Monday, Dec. 24). Employers' holiday
scheduling continues to be slightly more conservative than a
decade ago, when, for example, in 1990-1991, a year when the
national holidays also fell on Tuesday, seven out of 10
companies gave workers at least three days off. . . . Page

Just went to make sure that Christine was in Personic so that we could schedule her to come in.  She applied on her own to us through our website on 10/1/01.  According to the emails I have received, Lee Allbritton submitted her resume on 10/9/01.  Under normal circumstances, we (Enron) would already "own" this candidate, and we would not be willing to pay any fee to the agency.  

How would you like us to handle this?  I would be more than happy to call Lee and explain if that's the route you choose.  I didn't know what kind of relationship you had with him, or if you even wanted to mention this to him.

I'll wait to hear from either or both of you before we move forward with contacting either the candidate or Lee.

Molly



Lisa:  Let's hold off on scheduling her until we receive a response on this question.

Thanks,
Molly

Michelle and Steve,
Have we received the letter from the OFCCP regarding the closing of the Corporate Management Review?  This is the letter we are expecting as a result of your meeting in Washington, D.C. with the OFCCP about 6-7 weeks ago.

Should I contact Rosalee Fleming since the letter could have gone to Ken Lay?  Can you please let me know?  Thanks so much.

Regards,
Sandra

Lizzette, Michelle,

Thanks for the quick turnaround.  Per your notation in file 101lmp.doc, attached is a copy of the memo that was sent out by John Sheriff and Michael Brown.  There is an added piece where our Commercial and Commercial Support leads of the office added their bit.

Also, please note that the calculation in the separation calculator was off so I've corrected and attached here for your reference.  

Are we now waiting on Drew and Pat to come back with their comments of the documents?

  

Regards,
Cathy

Big Texas Law Firm Settling With Victims of Swindlers
The Associated Press
A major Texas law firm that once served President Bush is paying
millions of dollars to settle claims the firm was complicit in
fraud perpetrated by two of its clients. Locke Liddell & Sapp has
paid $30.5 million in the past two years to settle class-action
lawsuits by investors in enterprises run by convicted swindlers
Brian Russell Stearns and Russell Erxleben. The deals turned out to
be elaborate Ponzi schemes.

GOVERNMENT LAW - REDISTRICTING
In Re: Perry
Legislative immunity applies to the activities of the Legislative

redistricting plan; there could be a circumstance, albeit
extraordinary, that might constrict the grant of legislative
immunity when, as in this case, a plaintiff alleges that the action

no basis for restricting legislative immunity in this case. Supreme

Happy to talk with you about the ADA -- I've actually written two papers on the topic and edited an article in The Houston Lawyer on your very topic (albeit several years ago, which was before the Supremes spoke on the issue).  On the Senior Specialist position, I am happy to discuss that with you as well.  Please get with my assistant, Twanda Sweet, at 39402 to schedule a time next week to talk.  Michelle

My name is Jim Little.  I am a forth year Enron employee and a third year student at South Texas College of Law.

I am writing in response to a posting with your group for a Sr. Legal Specialist.  The posting itself contains no information about the job other than the fact that it is in the Labor and Employment Department.  I realize the expectation may be that I contact the recruiter directly; however, I felt efficiency would be served in contacting you directly.  I would appreciate any information you may provide including both duties and necessary qualifications.  

I would also appreciate you considering speaking with me in the near future concerning a paper I am writing about individuals with HIV and the protections they are afforded under the ADA.  I feel comfortable that Enron has addressed this issue and I am merely guessing that you would have been involved in such discussion or have familiarity through your various writings on the ADA.  I am still researching the topic, so it will be a few weeks before I would feel able to ask intelligent questions.  But I would appreciate knowing at this time if this is something you are able and willing to discuss.  

Thank you for your time,

Jim Little

Michelle,
I think what Gary really needs is a consulting agreement with a confidentiality clause.  Is this something you could draft for Gary?  If it is I will have Gary call you to discuss what it is that this group will provide Enron.
Thanks,
Brent

Brent,

please send a C.A. template to Riaz Siddiqi, Pres and CEO at Capstone Global Energy LLC. His email address is rsiddiqi@capstoneenergy.com.

We need the CA to cover a few things.  We plan to work together to offer corporate risk management solutions focused around weather.  We've targeted 3 customers to start on:  DTE, Connectiv, and First Energy.

The CA needs to address 3 things (we think):
1. the concept of working together to create these solutions
2. the specific clients
3. ideas we come up with

I assume "protected ideas" would need to be documented and stamped "confidential".

I know this is a pain - they want it and as a consulting company, intellectual property is all they really have.  And we know how you hate to start with someone else's CA... but we can get theirs if you'd like.

Gary

The dual payroll arrangement would imply dual benefits, which is not the intent.  We haven't included them in the US ERISA plans.  Since the UK benefits are a better deal, we need to document that they have waived the right to the US benefits.  Depending on how the conversation goes, you could use the discrimination rules as well.

I'll get duplicate copies to you for signature. The reason for doing this is more the former than the latter mentioned below.  However, there is a concern that other UK nationals remaining on the UK payroll could try to use the US non-discrimination rules to obtain US benefits, if you were provided both. Their success in such a challenge is questionable.

OK. Much better. Explain to me again why we have to do this? Is it purely to confirm we don't get stuff twice or is there a concern that our participation in both causes a sub-space paradox which may create a time vacuum into which the entire world population may be sucked?

Mich,

I believe Anne Koehler led Greg to believe the estate couldn't hire from NETCO, but I thought you and I had discussed a clause that would allow the estate access to certain people they need who may be going with NETCO. May not be a non-solicitation clause but I'm sure it effectively allowed estate to get people back from NETCO if it needed them?

Can you confirm

David

Subject: RE: employee issues between NetCo and Estate


I will let you and/or Robert work with Beth's group on this.  Jay's group and Jenny's group are probably OK with communication.  I think that if Beth's people and everyone else understand that although it will be a voluntary quit if they are on the NetCo list and do not accept a job with NetCo, their compensation will most likely be equal or better and they will be working for a going concern that is A rated.  Also, it seems that the NetCo people on Beth's list will be working for Webb assuming a deal gets done and they move over, so maybe you and Robert can work with Webb on this so that he can communicate with them as well if you think that is positive.

On the non-solicitation, if I was buying the trading company, I would like a one way non-solicitation where I could hire from the estate but they could not hire from me.  But practically speaking, I don't see why there needs to be one either way.  My logic is that in the first year, the estate would only hire back from NetCo an employee that was not liking it over there or who's job had become smaller, etc. and assuming the estate even had a job for them to do.  It just leaves the door open for a few people who may, within a year, want to move on and that the estate could use.  The estate will be a bankrupt entity with no trading so it is not like we can attract anyone who is happy and real valuable to NetCo. If there was not a non-solicitation either way, NetCo would also be free to hire from the estate a person they could attract.

They will go to NETCO on the same salary and in the position that you, Webb and Rub decide is appropriate, period. It may not have been in talking points but I think I made it reasonably clear in all the discussions I have had. I can't see any purchaser concluding that the way to make money with NETCO is to cut costs and since Webb and Rub will run IT and Bob Hall back office, they will be deciding who does what.

As to the no hire from NETCO I will look into it, but as a practical matter I can't see why the estate would want to be hiring or that a purchaser would be in agreement.

Sounds like we need to sit them down and get them back on the right track. I have a suspicion that since Beth in particular was dead against communicating anything that this was not handled well in Networks. I am not hearing any issues elsewhere.

Webb is the one most concerned. The talking points said nothing about a point in time when the option of going to the estate is closed and after that point not accepting a job with netco is a voluntary quit. Therefore I don't think people have that info. Also an attorney today said that the deal does not allow the estate to hire from netco for a year but that there is nothing about netco not hiring from the estate. Don't you think it should at least go both ways?

I am not the person deciding the above two issue  I am fine with a no option back to estate past a certain deadline but if that is the deal I think we should let them all know it. 

Also the visa issue, I think, is not whether the new employer will accept them it is whether the new company makes them a bad offer and the option to go to the estate is closed andthey are forced to accept it or be on the street with the clock ticking on them to find a new job or leave the country

Court Turns Back Employees' Stock Option Suit
Texas Lawyer
Reversing a 1st Court of Appeals decision, the Texas Supreme Court
held on Oct. 18 that former employees of a Monsanto Co. subsidiary
lost the right to buy company stock at favorable stock-option
prices after Monsanto sold the subsidiary where they worked. The
Houston court ruled unanimously in Monsanto Co. v. Kamel Boustany,
et al. that Monsanto's sale of Fisher Controls International Inc.
to Emerson Electric Co. in 1992 resulted in the termination of
Fisher employees, making them ineligible to buy Monsanto stock at a
price less than half the going rate.

administered cautiously and judiciously; whether such admonitions
violate a defendant's right to due process rests on the facts of
each case. Houston Court of Appeals, No. 14-00-00905-CR; Posted

TORTS - SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY
Texas Department of Transportation v. Sanchez
Because TXDOT had decided not to upgrade the four section head
traffic signal to a five section head until replacement was
"necessary," and replacement had not become "necessary" by the time
of the accident, an amber left-turn arrow was not the "absence" of
a traffic signal. San Antonio Court of Appeals, No. 04-01-00267-CV;

In Re: Republic Parking System of Texas, Inc.

DVDs would be good.  I got him the Godfather Trilogy, but you might consider other movies.  
He has Playstation 2, so games are a good idea.
He always likes short-sleeved, solid color polo shirts in size XL.
His Rice Owls baseball cap got mutilated when the baggage cart ran over his suitcase, so he could use a replacement.
Anything with the 40 theme would be fun.

Hope those ideas help.

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.

Here is my suggested response:
Enron's policy is to not comment on current litigation.  With respect to severance, if an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern.  No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.  In general, however, any severance waiver signed will include a release of claims for any and all conduct that has occurred to date.  Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts, including with respect to waiver requirements.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

I hate to keep bugging you, but I wondered if you had a readout of Bonnie's investigation?  It is not getting better here with Jonathan.  I  called his agency to alert them to some of the issues we discussed (i.e. taking long breaks and leaving the office for appointments outside of his job).  I suspect they have spoken to him because now we are getting emails every time he leaves his desk and every time he returns.  

I would, more than anything, like to replace him before we get into the thick of the PRC process, and I am anxious to know what the outcome of the inquiry is so that I may consider options.   

Thanks in advance, 
Gina

Per our conversations, I have two options from which to choose.  Accept another position within Enron by the end of October, or receive an involuntary severance package.  In order to fully understand these options and in order to make an informed decision, I feel it is necessary for me to be able to review the severance contract I will be required to sign.  Being asked to make this decision without access to the severance contract provisions denies me the capability to make an informed decision.

Michelle,

Here's the list of information I need for Northern Natural Gas:

1.  EEOC charges, lawsuits and/or judgments entered or settlement agreements reached in the last 2 years (including discrimination, harassment, workers' comp and ERISA claims, or otherwise), including any compliance agreements, consent decrees, etc. with any governmental agency (i.e..  OFCCP, EEOC, DOL, etc.)

2.  List of any pending government compliance audits, administrative proceedings, employee grievances regarding compliance with wage, overtime, or safety and health issues.

I talked with Valeria and she is pulling the EEOC charge information.  Of course, I need this as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help.

Ann

Thanks.  Great point.  We discussed but for the group of candidates they have this weekend are mostly from the US and they want to captured this level of detail.  A box called "Other" is put at the end to capture those non-US locations.

My one comment relates to the "where are you from" question.  We only list states in the US -- what about foreign-born students?  It seems like it would be a good idea to list regions of the US, then add Mexico, Canada, Carribbean, UK, Europe, Middle East, Asia, etc. to be more inclusive.  What do you think?

Jo Ann,

We really need to get full requirements outlined and a project scope document completed by the beginning of next week in order to make the deadline on this piece of work.  If possible, I think it would be best to have the requirements gathering meeting tomorrow afternoon.  Please let me know how I can help pull the meeting together.

Thanks!

Subject:	Change In Vacation Policy

It has been communicated that the vacation policy has, indeed, been approved by the Board Of Directors.  What needs to happen now is that a true cost estimate needs to be provided to the HR Heads (David Oxley?) so that funding for the system changes can be obtained.

ISC -- please put together a project scope document to configure SAP to do the following:

Vacation accrual will occur for all employees as it does now for new hires their first year.
Only 40 hours of "automatic" carryover will be allowed.  Any additional vacation carryover must be approved.
Employees will be able to go into vacation arrears up to their maximum entitlement for the year, plus any carryover.

I know this doesn't cover all of the details, but wanted to give you as much as I knew.  Please let me know when you'd like to get a meeting together to go over complete requirements, and I'll help pull that meeting together.

Payroll -- from a process perspective, it is my understanding that we will take as much overpayment as possible from the final payroll check.  It would probably be helpful to document how that process is carried out, and then put together a proposal on how it could be handled in the future -- TPC?  HR Rep?, etc.

Please let me know if anyone needs any additional information at this time; otherwise, I'll wait to hear from the ISC on when they'd like to get the requirements-gathering session put together.

Thanks.
Jo Ann

Rob,

Thanks. I am copying Jim on the entire exchange.

I realize things are hectic at Enron but they have been for some time
now and my payments can no longer be delayed. I think no one wants to
assume responsibility for this and that's why I am writing to you and
Jim because the delay is really reaching break point from my standpoint.
These are contractually agreed upon payments and they are not days or
weeks late but MANY MONTHS late. I really need to receive the payments
in a matter of days.

All the best and look forward to hearing from you.

Diomedes.

   Jim and Rob,

   I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be
   extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in
a
   position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below
to
   your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom
line
   is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me
   and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not
even
   responding to my requests for information.

   I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to
handle
   this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to
   make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the
   unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already
causing
   me serious  problems and potential losses.

   I look forward to your response.

   Thanks and hope to see you soon.

   Diomedes.

   Subject: Enron payments

   Mary Joyce,

   I hope all is well with you.

   I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron
which
   have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to
   contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies)
and
   Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The
   payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.

   After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments
(after
   leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to
   the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South
   America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe
works
   with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early
November,
   maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron
   require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee
   which would convene in early or late November".

   As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message
with
   Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two
messages
   with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this
   very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing
this
   email to make sure that my position is clear.

   These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see
no
   reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation
   Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have
been
   extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by
Enron
   up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the
   process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these
   payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions

>From what I understand, David Oxley walked someone out the earlier door today for posting in on an internet bulletin board.  I am trying to get details.  Did he run the termination by either of you? 

In any case, I've been told that he wants to publish a memo saying someone's been fired for breaking the rules.  I think that is a very, very bad idea.  So, I've drafted a reminder to give to David to publish instead.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Cynthia, Sandy,

Starting next week we will be rolling a out a Voluntary Separation Program for all employees of Enron Metals located in North America, roughly 70 employees who are all participating in Enron Corp's benefits plans.  The details of the this program are still being finalized by Michele Cash and her legal team, however, we will be communicating general details of the plan to our staff  tomorrow afternoon.

One of the communication documents that we will be providing employees is an FAQ of what happens in the event of termination, i.e. what happens to my vacation, what happens to by benefits, etc.   Do you have a similar Q&A document used in the past for these purposes?  Michele mentioned you may have something already prepared.  I could use the information provided in our normal termination letters, but if you've got something more in summary form, please let me know.

Please keep in mind, that I'll need to finalize the FAQ sheet for roll out Friday.

Thanks
Cathy

We have spoken to UAE's Bankers who have informed us that they do not wish for us (and our partner Covanta) to continue into Round 2.   Obviously bad news, but better to be out now rather than after 6 weeks of intensive due diligence.   If you'd like more details on why we fell short, feel free to give me a call.

thanks,

Hi Michelle-

Here's the Confidentiality Agreement we used at Mid Year for the HR staff who required access to employee records outside their own BU or access to restricted records (HR employees).

Would you like to revise this form, or shall we use the same version for this round?

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible. 

Thanks,

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Michelle,

May I have a copy of the agreement between Tindall & Foster and Enron as it pertains to the US immigration process.  Or perhaps you can advise if there is a clause stating that we must utilize them exclusively and if so what is the effective date.

Options
I don't see a path to ask questions about the merger, so I'm submitting here.  Will the merger ratio be applied to our option strike prices as well?  (e.g., for Enron options with a strike price of around $84, will the new strike price of these options be multiplied by .2685 for a new strike price of $22.55 in the new company's stock?)

Cost Savings
I moved to 3 Allen Center about a year and a half ago and was assigned a new phone number.  However, I occasionally receive forwarded calls from my old number (853-4792, I think).  It appears two direct dial numbers are being maintained for me, and likely for all employees who ever had an EB number and moved to 3AC.  We could save some money by getting rid of the old numbers.

Thanks,

Hi Michelle,
 
Thanks for the fyi, however the Service Center doesn't generate our documents for us.  In fact, due to the distance, they provide us support on an as needed basis, but what I will do is make sure we get all current documents from Irma so that we can make sure we are using the right versions.

Cathy, Unless there is something unusual about this situation, I think that the service center can do these documents, as they are standard.  We generally don't do termination letters here in legal unless there is a change to the form or something really sensitive.  So, no need to wait on us!  Just get with Irma's team.  Michelle

It would be a help if you could hold off until Monday afternoon to do communicate the termination.  We'll e-mail you the docs, and I can initial the waiver once she's returned it but before the Company signs.

<p><SPAN class=text2>The new Bella Sera Pinot Grigio is clean, crisp and refreshing. Utilizing fruit from the Tre Venezie region and subtle winemaker influence, Bella Sera captures the essence of the Pinot Grigio varietal and is a wine that is "true to the grape". The 1999 Pinot Grigio has a clear, straw color and a pleasant nose with delicate aromas of apricot and tropical fruit. This wine is refreshing and crisp with a light to medium body that will allow it to pair well with dishes of all types. Particularly good pairings include grilled vegetables, light pasta dishes and seafood. The refreshing style of the wine makes it a must for hot summer months.</P></span>

<p><SPAN class=text2>The new Bella Sera Merlot clearly attests to the rising notoriety of Merlot in general, and Italian Merlot in particular, by offering a full flavored style without the more astringent tannins found in Cabernet Sauvignon. Ruby red in color, with aromas of currants and cherries, Bella Sera Merlot offers supple plum and blackberry flavors on the palate, and a ripe, rich finish. The vibrant fruit flavors and good acidity of this Merlot make it an excellent match with a wide range of foods, including tomato-based pasta dishes, grilled meats and poultry.</P></span>

Cathy, 
1.    I believe we can make the statement in 2.3.  Basically, it's 
saying that an employee won't get benefits unless willing to sign a 
release that the company agree is fine.  However, even with this 
language, other external obligations will still apply to the company 
--e.g., the obligation to not offer contracts on a discriminatory basis. 
2.    You are right on 56 weeks.  I caught that as well and have 
changed. 
3.    I believe we could reduce the period, unless Pat thinks 
otherwise.  What period would you like?  Also, we could use oral notice 
if you like; however, I think written notice is better because there is 
a clear, objective indicator of when notice was provided from which to 
measure the time period. 
   I think the better approach on performance is include a 
statement about it in the faq's and spd documents, and shorten the 
notice period under 5.2(iv) (i.e., poor performance for x days is 
grounds for termination for cause and for denial of the severance 
benefits.) 
4.    Involuntary reduction plan.  I don't know the answer to this, 
but Michelle may. 
I have prepared a redlined version of the plan with my proposed changes. 
Cathy, I will incorporate your changes as well and forward the draft 
plan along with the FAQ's document, which now incorporates the benefits 
language. 
--Lizzette 
I agree with Lizzette's comments. 
Regarding item 3 and the remedial period to improve performance, the time period is a design decision.  There is no requirement for any remedial period, but by design, the employees will be more likely to accept the design without objecting to fairness if there is a reasonable remedial period.  The design theory is not to create a distraction that reduces productivity or creates distracting labor relations. 
I am not sure what the issue is about the amendment question.  There may be other employers who establish a separate voluntary severance program with different terms and provisions than the design incorporated into the Enron Metals program.  If this might become an Enron wide multiple employer issue, should it be addressed now at the Enron Corp. level? 
Pat

SICK LEAVE POLICY 

Policy

To keep the business and each department running smoothly and efficiently, it is important that every employee be on the job on time regularly.  For this reason, careful attention is given to promptness, absence record and overall dependability.

Enron recognizes, however, that an employee may occasionally be unable to come to work due to injury or illness.  As a result, the Sick Leave policy is designed to provide protection to employees against loss of income during pregnancy, illness or injury.

Eligible employees who are unable to perform their jobs due to pregnancy, illness or injury are eligible to receive sick leave pay for up to 1,040 hours (6 months) in a twelve month period, assuming certain procedures are followed.    Effective January 1, 2002, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) runs concurrently with Enron's Sick Leave policy.  An employee who is still disabled after using the 1,040 hours of sick leave pay ends may qualify for long term disability insurance.  Sick days cannot be carried over from one calendar year to the next and employees are not paid for sick days either at the end of the calendar year or upon termination.  

Proposed Policy Link

Procedures -

To be eligible for sick leave pay, employees unable to report to work must telephone their supervisor directly, each day of their absence, as far in advance as possible.  If their supervisor is not available, the employee's human resources representative should be contacted.  If an employee is unable to make the call personally, a family member or a friend should contact the supervisor.  The supervisor or human resources representative must be contacted each day of absence.  An employee who fails to contact his/her immediate supervisor or human resources representative may forfeit the sick leave pay and may be considered as having voluntarily resigned.  This policy must be followed unless an exception has been made for a particular absence, and a written memo to this effect has been sent to the employees' human resources representative.

On the fifth day of continued absence due to injury or illness, in addition to notifying the employee's supervisor or human resources representative, the employee must also attain a doctor's certification indicating the estimated date in which the employee will be able to return to work.  Any absences exceeding 2 weeks will require a doctor's certification indicating that the employee is able to return to work.

On November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue to match union employees' contributions to the Plan.

?	Diversification within the Plan will now be allowed, regardless of your age, from ALL company contribution accounts.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  Effective immediately, you can invest these amounts in the fund or funds of your choosing.

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Friends:

This Saturday, November 3, I am participating in the American Heart Walk, a 5k and 10k walk that raises money for the American Heart Association.  I am sure that all of you are very familiar with the fine work of this organization, but if you are not, here is its website:  http://www.americanheart.org/.  Moreover, most of you are likely familiar with my particular interest in heart related charities.

I am looking for sponsors and would be very grateful if you could make a donation.  Please let know as soon as possible if you can help, since I would like to collect most of the donations prior to Saturday.  Also, for you Enron types, don't forget about the Matching Gift Fund.

Thank you very much for your support.

Jim Grace

Thanks for the response.  A face to face with Mike I sounds like a good idea.  Among other things, remind him to contact Michelle Cash when he intends to use an outside counsel for legal matters.  Also, I'd like to review his 2001 and 2002 HR Budget with you when you get your hands on it.

Gary

Saw the email you forwarded......someone's lost the plot here!

I had sent an email to Mike -hinting that there should no longer be a need for retention (didnt want to go into print and actually say NEPCO was off the table given there's still one interested buyer in play, and I havent yet thought thru the impact of bringing in a partner).

Have now left two voicemails for Mike asking him to call to discuss.


Will be talking to Brian about it today, and will probably go up to Bothell for a day next week (mountains and Mohammad)! Also plan on getting together with Aaron and Lydecker early next week.

Will keep you posted

I am going to leave the office shortly.  In addition to sending the fax to
the office (212.310.8995), where Mary Jean will be able to get it tonight,
please send a copy to me at my home at 718.643.9434.

Thanks,

I just received another voice mail from Teresa, indicating that she would like to tell A&K yes.  The idea would be that the firm would get the employees to agree that if a dispute arises in the future, the A&K lawyers would not represent either side.

That would address the future litigation issue, though probably not the other issues.

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

You might want to consider a sport membership if it means we can use the gym/tennis courts at the Summit club that the Sholeen's belong to.

<p><span class="text2">As Turning Leaf wines are handcrafted for
perfection, a majority of the grapes for Turning Leaf were selected
from some of the finest vineyards in the Lodi region. A major
winegrape-growing region since the 1850s, Lodi is increasingly
looked to by leading California wineries for grapes of superior
quality. The warm days and cool nights of its Mediterranean climate
allow the grapes to develop excellent color and maintain crisp acid
levels through to harvest. The end result is a well-balanced
fruit-forward Chardonnay with excellent varietal
character.</span></p>

This is not a problem.  Twanda usually makes arrangements in her instructio=
ns to the temporary so we can work around it.  I agree with you that your f=
iles are highly confidential and no one should have access unless you so de=
signate.  My message was a general one that went out to everyone in the dep=
artment.  It's up to each individual to give access (or not) to whatever th=
ey would like a temp to use in order to support them in their Assistant's a=
bsence.  We have set up the temporary ID's as per Mark Haedicke's office to=
 give access mainly to calendars only in order to help the temp field phone=
 calls, make appointments, and to generally let the temp know where everyon=
e is in case Mr. Haedicke is looking for someone.

Becky,

Given the nature of what I do, no one in my group will be able to provide t=
hese types of temporary rights to documents or calendar entries.  I do not =
believe that any of the other temporary ID's have access to our stuff, so I=
 would think that these new IDs would be the same.

I hope that does not pose a problem, but I believe that the confidentiality=
 considerations should outweigh the convenience factor for a temporary work=

Subject: New Temp IDs



Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temp=
orary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access ri=
ghts for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While do=
ing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are=
 listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access r=
ights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=20
For Outlook users only!=20

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e=
-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently,=
 the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to O=
utlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights =
to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control h=
ow much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you coul=
d give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail =
or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to y=
ou.

Please give access to the following IDs:=20
EWS Legal Temp 1=20
EWS Legal Temp 2=20
EWS Legal Temp 3=20
EWS Legal Temp 4=20
EWS Legal Temp 5=20
EWS Legal Temp 6=20
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.=20
EWS Legal Temp 8=20
EWS Legal Temp 9=20
EWS Legal Temp 10=20
EWS Legal Temp 11=20

To set up access:=20
1.      Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if y=
our folders list is not visible, click on "View" and

        then "Folder List")=20

2.      Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up=
=20

3.      Left click on the "Permissions" tab=20

4.      Left click on "Add".=20
        Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.=20
        Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the =
"Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not

        to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)=20
        Left Click "OK"=20

5.      You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first I=
D you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then

        left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not h=
olding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which

        access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do=
 not select anything that has "own" or "owner"

        in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".=20

6.      Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.=
=20

7.      [Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may =
have, right click on that folder and repeat steps

         2-5 above.=20

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be complete=
d only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come i=
n handy!

Thank you for your time and patience.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Bob:

I have reviewed the attached engagement letter with KPMG and noted several =
comments, all of which have been highlighted for your ease of reference. In=
 addition, we need to discuss whether any of the following provisions shoul=
d be added:

(1)=09Warranty for Performance Standards =20

=09This is the standard language developed by Michelle Cash for agreements =
involving professional services:
=09
=09Vendor shall perform the Services in a good and workmanlike manner and i=
n accordance with =09the highest industry standards.  Vendor warrants that =
it has the experience and capability, =09including supervisory competence, =
to perform the Services.  Vendor has all licenses, =09permits, and registra=
tions necessary to provide the Services.  Vendor also warrants that it =09a=
nd its employees will follow the principles set forth in Enron's Code of Et=
hics and hereby =09acknowledges that it has received and read the Enron Cod=
e of Ethics.

(2)=09Mark Holsworth and Michelle Cash have developed the following languag=
e pertaining to confidentiality obligations and proprietary issues. I reali=
ze it is rather lengthy for an engagement letter but perhaps we should cons=
ider some variation thereon. {See Intellectual Property Attachment.)

 (3)=09I would also recommend that we insert the following indemnification =
language:

KPMG AGREES TO DEFEND, PROTECT, RELEASE, INDEMNIFY, AND HOLD COMPANY AND EN=
RON, THEIR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, AND EMPLOYEES, AND THEIR AFFILIATES=
 AND SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS AND EMP=
LOYEES, HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND CAUSES O=
F ACTION BROUGHT BY VENDOR, ITS EMPLOYEES, OR THIRD PARTIES FOR ECONOMIC LO=
SSES, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY (TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE), OR INJURIES OR DEATH OF =
PERSONS, AND ALL EXPENSES (INCLUDING REASONABLE AND NECESSARY ATTORNEY'S FE=
ES), COSTS, LIABILITIES, AND JUDGMENTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, AR=
ISING OUT OF, OR RESULTING FROM, VENDOR'S ACTIONS OR INACTIONS UNDER THIS A=
GREEMENT, INCLUDING VENDOR'S NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, VIOLATION OF STA=
TUTE, OR BREACH OF LEGAL DUTY IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF OR IN AN=
Y WAY INCIDENT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED HEREIN.  IN T=
HE EVENT THAT AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY IS ADJUDICATED TO HAVE BEEN PARTIALLY OR=
 SOLELY LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH ECONOMIC LOSSES, DAMAGE TO PROPERTY (T=
ANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE), OR INJURIES OR DEATH OF PERSONS, THIS CONTRACTUAL O=
BLIGATION OF INDEMNIFICATION SHALL CONTINUE, BUT VENDOR'S INDEMNIFICATION O=
BLIGATION SHALL NOT EXTEND TO THE PERCENT OF RESPONSIBILITY ATTRIBUTED TO T=
HE INDEMNITEE.  THIS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OF INDEMNIFICATION SHALL SURVIV=
E SETTLEMENT OF ANY UNDERLYING THIRD-PARTY CLAIM, INCLUDING VOLUNTARY SETTL=
EMENTS MADE BY THE INDEMNITEE WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY.  VENDOR AGREES TO INDE=
MNIFY AND DEFEND COMPANY AND ENRON FOR ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, OR CAUSE OF ACTIO=
N FOR ANY COMPANY BENEFITS MADE BY ANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES THAT ARE PLACED BY =
THE VENDOR WITH THE COMPANY OR ENRON FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME.

Hi Diane, 
The attached files are Business Objects reports and should be converted to excel by Kathy Schultea.  Kathy should be adding the HR employees and then the files should go directly with Jeanneret.  No need to copy me on the files, due to confidentiality of HR data.  You can just let me know the files went.  Thanks.

Alison,
The employment agreements for the Japan employees state in the vesting schedule [for the stock options granted as a signing bonus]:
vesting for the options will be as follows:
-One third on the first anniversary of date of employment
-A further third on the second anniversary date of employment
-The final third on the third anniversary date of employment

The options can not vest on the anniversary of the date of employment, rather it is supposed to vest on the anniversary of date of grant.
Michelle,
Correct me if I am wrong--we can still go ahead and grant these for the November 1 grant date, but we need to get an amendment to change that wording.
Thank you
Dana Bryant

Attached is the revised summary of the recommendations coming out of the Diversity Subcommittee.  If there are additional comments, please feel free to pass them on.

Is is also my understanding that Jeff is working with Andrea and Michelle regarding the "metrics'' accumulated with respect to diversity performance with a focus on verification, context, and presentation so as to supplement our recommendations.  In that regard (and after discussing with Kirk), we should begin organizing a formal presentation for the OTC of these materials.  One approach may be as follows:

(1) Convert the Recommendations and Metrics into approximately 5 slides: (a) Slide 1-Overview; (b) Slide 2-What type of data was used as support and why; (c) Slide 3-  Presentation of the metrics and what we believe that data is indicating; (d) Review of Recommendations/Action Items and the supporting Business Case; and (e) Next Steps.

(2) Identify and present key metrics; identify backup slides with data points.

I am hopeful that we can finalize these items in the next week so we can review with Cindy in early October and be prepared to meet with the OTC sometime in October.
Please let me know your thoughts and suggestions.  Thank you for your time.

Jordan

Frankly I would rather have ak across from us than other counsel Because I think that they will be cognizant of future poential and probably won't be too obnoxious.  Is Derrick ok with it? Generally he doesn't like these but I am ok if Teresa wants to let them.  Michelle

Subject:	Mid-Year 2001 PRC Data for Jeanerette

Michelle, 
After reviewing the data that I prepared a few weeks ago w/o HR, I still felt uncomfortable with the data integrity isses, especially after getting feedback from Felecia on how she has pulled the data in the past.  So I have scrubbed the data as much as possible and am attaching the business objects reports so that Kathy can run under her ID to capture the HR data.  This will prevent her from creating the report from scratch.  I would like to prepare a list of some of the required analysis and be included in the conversation with Jeanerette when providing instructions.  I will send this to you in the am.

Kathy, 
If you can run the reports, export to excel and deliver a file to Michelle Cash tomorrow I would greatly appreciate it.  Please let me know if you make any changes to the query so that I stay in sync as I generate other reports.

   << File: Diversity - Mid Year 2001 Download for calculating Standard deviation (expats).rep >>  << File: Diversity - Mid Year 2001 Download for calculating Standard deviation.rep >> 

Please note the following challenges.
Although HRGIS-WP and the Demographics Universe have a lot of the same datafields, Felecia recommended that I merge the performance data into the Demographics data.  I was unable to do this in BO because the universes are not compatible and BO only allows you to combine queries from the same universe.
Exporting to Excel is really too manually intensive and I am trying not to create additional databases as done in the past. My plan is to document the processes, identify the going forward requirements and submit for automation.
 The expats data in the UK is coming from SAP-UK and they do not configure for ethnicity on that version.  So in HRGIS-WP the ethnicity is showing 'Unknown'.  UK Expats also have two different records in the data warehouse and they are not tied together in anyway.  I manually identified the ethnicity that resides in the US version and coded the ethnicity as a variable in the expat query.
There is still a lot of blank ethnicity fields and I will be send the HR Generalist a note to update the source system.  
In trying to identify US employees, I came across potential mapping issues with the currency code.  Questions have been forwarded to Kathy Schultea for review.  There was one expat employee filtered out that was not on US payroll but showed his salary as USD.

A positive note: 
Today Leticia Barrios provided me with an update to the data mart which now shows the data source.  Although the problem is not resolved, this made the scrubbing much easier.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I let him know that Enron doesn't typically hire right out of law school, but was wondering if there might be someone he could talk to about "a day in the life of a corporate lawyer."  Is there someone in particular who handles recruiting for legal?

Just to clarify, for the annual incentive plan, the Board has discretion to make downward adjustments based on possible nonrecurring items or unordinary items.

Subject:	Q&A on Employment Agreements with Bonus/LTI Grants contingent on company meeting earnings targets

I've had a question from an employee who just signed an employment agreement that provides a grant of stock options in 2002 subject to "Enron meeting its earnings targets" and who wanted to know whether it was based on recurring or non-recurring earnings. 

The Enron Corp. Annual incentive plan specifically states that bonus funding is based on whether Enron meets after-tax recurring net income targets as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board.  For long-term incentives, while we are not specific about this in any formal plan/program document, it is strongly recommended that the response to this question be:

"Enron's compensation programs have been established to reward employees for the Company's overall operating performance relative to pre-established annual performance measures including key financial goals.  In January of each year, the Board certifies the level to which the performance targets were attained for the prior fiscal (calendar) year and establishes targets for the upcoming year.  As such, Enron's compensation programs are discretionary in nature and the Board has the authority to consider unordinary or nonrecurring items events in determining whether awards are appropriate."

Let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks.

Here's our best effort at providing you answers to frequently asked questions.  I've left a couple of blanks in health benefit answers for the appropriate name of the former employer, if you wouldn't mind filling in those blanks.

Cynthia, Sandy,

Starting next week we will be rolling a out a Voluntary Separation Program for all employees of Enron Metals located in North America, roughly 70 employees who are all participating in Enron Corp's benefits plans.  The details of the this program are still being finalized by Michele Cash and her legal team, however, we will be communicating general details of the plan to our staff  tomorrow afternoon.

One of the communication documents that we will be providing employees is an FAQ of what happens in the event of termination, i.e. what happens to my vacation, what happens to by benefits, etc.   Do you have a similar Q&A document used in the past for these purposes?  Michele mentioned you may have something already prepared.  I could use the information provided in our normal termination letters, but if you've got something more in summary form, please let me know.

Please keep in mind, that I'll need to finalize the FAQ sheet for roll out Friday.

Thanks
Cathy

Yes, Terrie James will coordinate that effort. 

 I am, however, working with Simone Lewis to coordinate the publication of the immigration Q&As on Livelink.  I am hopeful that this information will be published today by 1:30 p.m.   Simone will send an e-mail to the HR Generalists informing them that the information is available on Livelink.  Thanks, Cole.

Teresa Bushman called me with a questions that has been passed along from Dave Reynolds to Jim Derrick, to Mark Haedicke to Theresa . . .  

The gist of the question is whether we object to A&K representing 3 geophysicists in negotiations with Mariner on employment contracts.

Because we're doing employment work for Mariner under a services agreement, that could (1) put A&K across the table from us in negotiations; and (2) pit A&K against us if we ever have a breach of contract issue or have to enforce a non-compete, etc. for those employees.  Also, I don't know whether A&K has represented Enron on employment contracts, but if so, the firm may have confidential information related to how we approach such contracts (much of which likely wouldn't be different for Mariner's contracts), and I wouldn't want them negotiating from that base of knowledge.    

In addition, Theresa Bushman believes that Mariner may use A&K for some work in the future.

All in all, I would say no on this.  What do you think?

Cathy,

Michelle's dead on, and once whe pointed that out, it made sense to me.  

But, even so, the lower calculation portion under the Voluntary Separation header does not appear to include any sort of four weeks pay line (I wrongly thought that was what the 2 week pay line was referring to).  So, an employee looking at the info can't clearly see 4 weeks being added in (if it is being added in as set up right now, which I can't tell).   If it's not being added in, the Voluntary Separation Payment line will be wrong and look smaller than it should.  

Can we we set the lines after 2 week's pay to look the the math formula in the upper portion of the page?

		Sep. pay per service year
	+ 	Sep pay per 10k salary
	+	4 weeks base pay
	=	Total Vol. Sep payment

The 2 weeks is the amount of years of service,  or the amount of 10K increments in salary.  The 4 weeks is a premium on top of that amount.

Cathy,

The voluntary separation calculator asks for a number for 2 weeks pay.  Should that be four weeks, or does the program take the 2 weeks and multiply it to arrive at the four weeks base pay number?  If the latter, I can see it creating some confusion.  If the calculation sheet needs to be set up that way, perhaps we should drop a note explaining.

Michelle, 

On the INS forms, there are two places which refer to: 

Gross Annual Income:    $100 billion 
Net Annual Income:              $979 million            


Currently when Tindall & Foster are completing the forms they use our annual report to complete these.  Would you advise if we should revised these with the recent events and include the appropriate statement/restatement with the annual report we submit?  Or continue utilizing only the annual reports and the figures held within?

Thank you.

There are a couple of blanks that we need filled in in this petition.  First, where is EGM incorporated?  We listed EGM as the plaintiff because that is the entity that was the party to the contract with McGowan.  Second, we need a last known address for McGowan.

Jeanie,

In response to your inquiry about  the above referenced non-solicitation provisions, I note as follows: The provisions are contained in the Employee Matters Agreement executed by Enron and AEP. HR should have a copy of this agreement.....if you need a copy please let me know.  The relevant provision is Section 1,subsection (c).  This is basically a 12 month mutual non-solicitation running from June 1, 2001. It is quite complex and factually driven.  In order to provide the requested legal advice I would need to personally discuss all of the surrounding facts with the ENA client who is contemplating  hiring an AEP/HPL employee.  Please ask that person to give me a call so that I may make the inquiries necessary to give appropriate legal advice. Of course, if you desire to join in the call , a conference call among the 3 of us would be welcomed.

 When you called me you mentioned that the client was quite sure that any non-solicitation restriction lasted only  a 6 months. Thus,  this note is merely a heads-up on the length of the non-solicitation period .  Please call me with any questions that you might have. Since you informed me that are new to Enron, I wanted you to make sure that you  were aware that it is Enron's policy that interpretation of legal agreements must be done by or on connection with an Enron lawyer, be it Michelle Cash (our ENA  lawyer who handles HR matters) or the ENA lawyer who worked on the transaction at issue.

I look forward to having the opportunity to meet you and hopefully working with you at some point.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Malcolm,

      Please accept my sincere apology for not being able to join Enron
right now as I had an unavoidable emergency at home that has forced me to
come to India over the weekend.My stay here might stretch to approximately a
month or so.I donot want that the company shall suffer any loss due to my
absense so pls advice accordingly.  Your company offers an invaluable
opportunity, and I would appreciate any consideration you can give me in
rescheduling my joining date after a month.
Pls contact my fiancee Kamal for any urgent issue as I am keeping my
cellphone with her.She would convey the message to me by best means.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Cynthia, Sandy,

Starting next week we will be rolling a out a Voluntary Separation Program for all employees of Enron Metals located in North America, roughly 70 employees who are all participating in Enron Corp's benefits plans.  The details of the this program are still being finalized by Michele Cash and her legal team, however, we will be communicating general details of the plan to our staff  tomorrow afternoon.

One of the communication documents that we will be providing employees is an FAQ of what happens in the event of termination, i.e. what happens to my vacation, what happens to by benefits, etc.   Do you have a similar Q&A document used in the past for these purposes?  Michele mentioned you may have something already prepared.  I could use the information provided in our normal termination letters, but if you've got something more in summary form, please let me know.

Please keep in mind, that I'll need to finalize the FAQ sheet for roll out Friday.

Thanks

Michelle,

The mole hill appears to have grown into a mountain.  I asked Alisa Petteway to communicate to Judy Gray to contact Kathy and/or you, if necessary on this matter as I have exhausted my ability to effectively communicate "why changing the data is not prudent or historically accurate", as well as the fact that I have not received any other document that demonstrates a reason to correct the data for 1/1/2000 through 2/1/2000.  The title change did occur subsequent to the salary increase. 

Regards,
Milton

Subject: North America Voluntary Separation Roll-out


Joe, Drew,
 
Looks like we are on target for the US roll out.  Following a conference call with our US legal team today, we've determined that Metals US will be able to roll-out a Voluntary Separation Program as planned. Plan documents are being drafted and revised by internal and external counsel now with finalization targetted for end of week.  With this in mind the following is our timeline for roll-out:
 
Thursday, 4:30PM (EST) - Presentation to the staff announcing general details of program
Friday, COB - Plan documents and details of the plan will be e-mailed to employees.
Monday, 22 Oct, Official start of program
Friday, 02 Nov, Official end of program
 
I will copy you in on final versions of the communciations and plan documents once they are ready.
 
If any questions, please advise.
 
Regards,
Cathy

I just wanted you to know that the transaction that I worked on with Joyce was a purchase of chips from Smith @ associates.  I believe you have the documentation on this.

Sheila,

Per your request, attached is a copy of our presentation being given to employees today.  I've also attached my speaking notes for the HR piece of it.

Can you also give it a once over for legal review?

Thanks

Dear Michelle and Richard:
 
The answer is yes, she was an employee of Enron.
 
I will secure her PH file in order to secure her dates of employment.

We need to know the employment status of one additional person.  Can you

let us know whether "Lea Fastow" was an Enron employee and what her dates

of employment are if she was?

   Thanks for the information, however I have a question for the 14

   individuals in which we have "No record in SAP".   Do we know for

   certain

   that these individuals where not employed with Enron , or is it that

   there

   is no record of them in SAP HR.  Would a query out of the HR

   datawarehouse

   tell us more information?

   Thanks,

The original fax I sent to you on Friday are the only names that John wanted the letters for.  I misread the paper and did 4 extra people by mistake.  EEEK!  Anyway - I think he may want some revisions today, so please let me know if you are making any adjustments or changes to the documents from Friday!  Thank you!

Best Regards,
Julie Clyatt

Do we want to say we will exhaust all available possibilities?  That seems like a huge promise, as there may be some approach that is not reasonable, but would be an available possibility.  I would rather give us our own discretion to do what we deem appropriate to assist in this regard.  What does Mary Jean think?

I hope you and the family have a great New Year.  We are not sure where  we will be this week, so I don't think we'll make it to the party. I hope you have  fun.

I saw the e-mail from Kerry Notestine and called him.  Twanda sent the information he needed re McGowan.  He's got everything ready, but he's not sure you got to speak with the Weil Gotchal attorneys to see if it was OK to file the lawsuit?  Please call him.  Thanks.

I'm filing (Project April).

Michelle,

We offered an Employment Agreement to Claudio Ribeiro a few months back which he declined.  Mark Tawney and he have re-entered negotiations.  Mark wants to put in writing that we will compensate Claudio for the otherwise non-compensated 3 month non-compete period and offer him the same terms again.  Can I get a revised version from you this week? 

Thanks,
Dave

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Sure, why don't you send them over to me (snail mail is fine)?  That would be great. Although not a bunch of weekend work, this week has more than made up for it!  Thanks. Michelle

Dear David:

Thanks so much for your voicemail message confirming your agreement and ass=
urance that the Enron HR Global team will ensure compliance with the strate=
gy approved by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors relating to the use of se=
parate lines of business to manage Enron's risks, liabilities and costs.

As you know Enron maintains many separate lines of business with separate a=
ssets, directors, officers, employees and payrolls.  This provides a protec=
tive shield described or known as the "corporate veil".  Thus, in the event=
 of litigation, only the assets of the individual business are subject to s=
aid litigation, its attendant risks, liabilities and costs if Enron adheres=
 to basic corporate principles and the separate line of business is truly a=
 separate entity.  If the corporate veil is pierced and other Enron entitie=
s, including Enron Corp. are successfully subjected to the risks, liabiliti=
es and costs of said litigation, then all of the assets of Enron would be a=
t risk.   Further, litigation, risk management, accounting and finance, tax=
, treasury, and many other Enron Corp. groups work diligently to ensure com=
pliance with this strategy.  All filings with the federal government, inclu=
ding the 10K and Proxy Statements, reflect this strategy. In addition, ther=
e are certain Enron benefits, namely the Enron Corp. 1994 Deferral Plan, wh=
ich require all participants in said plan be an employee of Enron Corp.

One of the additional ways Enron minimizes said risks is to ensure that emp=
loyees are employed and paid by the proper employer.  Thus, Enron has many =
payrolls and Enron Corp. is not a master payroll company.  As you know, the=
 pipelines are regulated by the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission)=
 and separate payrolls are necessary for each pipeline.  Further, Enron has=
 separate payrolls for it union companies, its third country nationals and =
its expatriates.   These payrolls are in addition to the local payrolls of =
Enron in those countries in which we do business around the world.

Thus, it is imperative that each of the Enron entities properly reflect the=
ir respective directors, officers, and employees.  Here in the United State=
s, each of our separate lines of business have separate Federal Employer Id=
entification Numbers.  During times of Enron reorganization and movement of=
 Enron employees from one Enron entity to another, if this movement results=
 in a change in the employee's employer, under the U.S. Tax laws, FICA With=
holding for both the new Enron employer and employee begin again.  The empl=
oyee may file a new W-4 form to alleviate some of the tax consequences or t=
he employee can wait until he/she files the income tax return for the year =
in question and receive a refund.  The Enron employer does not receive a re=
fund or any credit when it must pay the employer's portion of FICA even tho=
ugh it has been paid in whole or in part by another Enron employer.  This p=
ayment by the Enron employer is a small amount to pay in comparison to the =
overall risks.

As we discussed, any changes with respect to this strategy, including the i=
mpact on payroll, Enron employers, and Enron employees must be reviewed and=
 approved by the Enron Corp. Board of Directors due to the significant risk=
s to Enron Corp., its subsidiaries, divisions, and affiliates. =20

I appreciate your enthusiasm for compliance with this important strategy an=
d respectfully request your immediate assistance in communicating this stra=
tegy to your team and assuring that they in turn make sure that all of the =
Enron employees who are not currently employed by the proper Enron employer=
 are transferred as soon as humanly possible in order to minimize the risks=
.  I understand that failure to place the employee in the proper company ha=
s an impact in many areas around Enron, including PRC, compensation, ibuyit=
, ipayit, and benefits, just to name a few.=20

If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-7224.

Thanks so much for your help.

Sharon

I have given the subpoena you received to Richard Sanders and Bob Williams, who are handling these subpoenas.  You are not alone!!!  Many other folks received these today, so they are going to coordinate responses.

Not to worry!

Rob,

Thanks. I am copying Jim on the entire exchange.

I realize things are hectic at Enron but they have been for some time
now and my payments can no longer be delayed. I think no one wants to
assume responsibility for this and that's why I am writing to you and
Jim because the delay is really reaching break point from my standpoint.
These are contractually agreed upon payments and they are not days or
weeks late but MANY MONTHS late. I really need to receive the payments
in a matter of days.

All the best and look forward to hearing from you.

Diomedes.

   Jim and Rob,

   I hope you are both doing well. I realize that you must both be
   extremely busy with other more important issues but I find myself in
a
   position that I HAVE to raise the issue described in the email below
to
   your direct attention. The email is self explanatory but the bottom
line
   is that not only has Enron failed to make payments that are due to me
   and to one of my companies for MONTHS now but  the company is not
even
   responding to my requests for information.

   I would highly appreciate it if you advised me on the best way to
handle
   this, i.e WHO do I need to talk to who has the decision authority to
   make the payments and give me answers. I stress once more that the
   unjustified delays by Enron in making these payments is already
causing
   me serious  problems and potential losses.

   I look forward to your response.

   Thanks and hope to see you soon.

   Diomedes.

   Mary Joyce,

   I hope all is well with you.

   I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron
which
   have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to
   contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies)
and
   Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The
   payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.

   After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments
(after
   leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to
   the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South
   America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe
works
   with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early
November,
   maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron
   require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee
   which would convene in early or late November".

   As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message
with
   Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two
messages
   with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this
   very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing
this
   email to make sure that my position is clear.

   These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see
no
   reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation
   Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have
been
   extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by
Enron
   up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the
   process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these
   payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions
   that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than
Wednesday,
   October 24.

   Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the
   appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.

   I look forward to hearing from you,

   Regards,


   Diomedes Christodoulou.

OK. Much better. Explain to me again why we have to do this? Is it purely to confirm we don't get stuff twice or is there a concern that our participation in both causes a sub-space paradox which may create a time vacuum into which the entire world population may be sucked?

Valeria/Michelle -  Chevondra was offered a 30-day trail period working for Dale Neuner and if she was successful in her efforts, then she would have an option to officially transfer to Dale's department.  The trial period was complete as of November 15th and Dale has contacted EGM HR requesting the transfer of Chevondra into his group.

However, there was a contingency in Chevondra's transfer.  She was to sign a promissory note (for outstanding personal calls on a company cell phone), as well as return the company cell phone.  Shanna and I are unaware of  the cell phone or the signed promissory note being returned at this time. 

Could you please provide the recommended next steps?

Lizzette. Would you mind getting with Diane on the isue of online harassment prevention training?  We have been looking into that form of delivering training. Diane has info from Littler on its proposed training. I think that the costs may be high, but I would like your evaluation of The product. Would you mind taking the lead on this?  Obviously, this is not an issue with huge time sensitivity. Thanks. Michelle

Thank you for the update.  We will change on the future billing.

We have a batch of final bills that will go out in a few days.  Can we leave
your name on them and send them to Margaret?  Or will that create too much
confusion?

(Sorry to hear that you are leaving!  You've done a wonderful job.)

Company Name   - Codes
Margaret Daffin, EID # 10004155

Margaret will be reviewing and coding these invoices.  Michelle will
provide a second review and approval on an as-needed basis.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Dear Kidventure Family,

We hope everyone is doing great!  Believe it or not, the holidays are
just around the corner and this means Holiday Camp is too!  Winter in
Texas is the theme this year and we want to see everyone for this "cool"
event.

Attatched to this email is the brochure for Holiday Camp.  Registration
will begin at 12 noon on Monday October 29th and will remain open until
all spaces have been reserved. Simply log on to kidventurecamp.com or
call the office at 713.960.8989. You will have the option of selecting

The camp will be highlighted by Kidventure's 2nd Annual Mt. Venture snow
day with sledding, snowman contest and much more.  Earlier in the week
campers will be part of teams that will design and build bobsleds to be
raced on Mt. Venture.  So break out the mittens and ear-muffs and join
us for this most memorable holiday event.

Michelle,
 
Below is a draft discipline letter for your approval.  It is intended to be used with employees who are determined to be posting to web-based bulleting boards during company hours.
 
You approved this a year or so ago, but I wanted to run it by you again in case anything has changed.

An investigation has determined that you have participated in discussions on web-based bulletin boards during working hours.  Your comments, posted using company equipment and using a name intended to hide your identity, concerned Enron issues that could possibly be construed as insider information.

You are to immediately cease this activity and come into compliance with Enron's Code of Ethics. Repeated violations will subject you to further discipline, up to and including termination.

I know it is going to be wild today, so Rennard and  I will take shifts and I will be in later this morning.

Michelle:  Just for my own curiosity, Bobbi Tessandori has informed me that in future all of the documents coming from Tindall & Foster now need Sheila Knudsen's signature, instead of mine?  

I believe Jane Allen, as Director, was the highest level individual ever signing the INS documents, as in most of the old files, I see the signatures of HR Specialists, etc., such as myself.

I certainly will abide by whatever management decides needs to be done in the future, but I am just interested to know why the sudden change?

I would appreciate your input.
Many thanks
Margaret

I think this covers it.  The one issue that you may want to clarify is that the second termination option would entail payouts over time, until the termination of the fund, which Gene believes may have some real value.  Michelle

Subject:	EIP Incentive Plan

Hello everyone,

Attached is a summary write-up I've prepared on the EIP Plan (it's origin, current status and why we feel it s/b terminated) to deliver to Mary Joyce for her conversation with Mark Frevert.  I felt it a good idea to summarize all on one piece of papaer  in case Marke Frevert was not familar with the Plan.  This Plan is pretty intense when even intimate with it's details!

Sheila/Michelle, could you pls. both review prior to me delivering to Mary to see if I've missed anything or am describing anything incorrectly.  Pam is out today.  I appreciate it.  After your review I'll deliver.  I feel it's going to be very critical to get Mark's support on this to take it to the "termination" level, so I want this to go smoothly.

I'm also going to dabble around with a few "settlement payout" scenarios, based on the actual fund size, original expectations, remaining participants, etc.  I'll send to you for review and we'll have in our back pocket when it's time to talk to Gene.

Thanks all!

Susan

Michelle, 
After our conversation on Wednesday, we put together a summary of RIF Issues and Strategies to review with the key HR personnel.  Attached is a copy of the summary for your review.  In addition, attached is a copy of recommendations from a compliance  perspective on areas that we would like to see considered as plans are made.  Robert Jones has recommended that we meet with you and Robert Vote from a litigation perspective on what we should be looking at from a compliance standpoint, specifically with adverse impact analysis.  Please let me know when we can quickly get together. Thanks. ay

Here is my suggested response:
Enron's policy is to not comment on current litigation.  With respect to severance, if an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern.  No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.  In general, however, any severance waiver signed will include a release of claims for any and all conduct that has occurred to date.  Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts, including with respect to waiver requirements.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

Good luck.

I would like the message to be even stronger than that -- he is not supposed to hire any outside counsel at all, for anything -- that is supposed to be done through legal department, per Jim Derrick's strictly-enforced rules.  He knows this and continues to violate that rule.  I suggest that he must hear a strong message, with disciplinary potential if he does it again.  Otherwise, this will have to be escalated to Derrick, since it continues to happen again despite my requests that he not do it.

In fact, he never contacts me for anything, which makes me nervous.  I would suggest that you would want him to have the same processes that we have in the rest of Enron regarding terminations of employment, which is that they go through legal if they are for any reason other than ROF.  That way, we may be able to catch some of the issues before they become more significant.  Similarly, I would like to be informed of employee relations issues that could bubble up into legal concerns.  I don't have much optimism for this, but still would like to ask for it!

Thanks for the response.  A face to face with Mike I sounds like a good idea.  Among other things, remind him to contact Michelle Cash when he intends to use an outside counsel for legal matters.  Also, I'd like to review his 2001 and 2002 HR Budget with you when you get your hands on it.

Saw the email you forwarded......someone's lost the plot here!

I had sent an email to Mike -hinting that there should no longer be a need for retention (didnt want to go into print and actually say NEPCO was off the table given there's still one interested buyer in play, and I havent yet thought thru the impact of bringing in a partner).

Have now left two voicemails for Mike asking him to call to discuss.


Will be talking to Brian about it today, and will probably go up to Bothell for a day next week (mountains and Mohammad)! Also plan on getting together with Aaron and Lydecker early next week.

Will keep you posted

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Hi Diane, 
The attached files are Business Objects reports and should be converted to excel by Kathy Schultea.  Kathy should be adding the HR employees and then the files should go directly with Jeanneret.  No need to copy me on the files, due to confidentiality of HR data.  You can just let me know the files went.  Thanks.

NLRB RULES 2-1 FIRM MUST APPLY BARGAINING CONTRACT TO TEMPS

A gourmet foods distributor in New York committed an unfair
labor practice by refusing to apply any provisions of a
bargaining contract to temporary warehouse workers supplied
by various staffing firms, the National Labor Relations
Board rules 2-1 ("Tree of Life Inc. d/b/a Gourmet Award
Foods Northeast, "336 N.L.R.B. No. 77, 10/1/01 [released
10/18/01]). Members Truesdale and Liebman find the temporary
warehouse workers are included in the contract's broad unit
definition of "drivers and warehousemen." The majority
concludes Tree of Life Inc. "had a statutory obligation to
apply to those employees the contractual terms it had
negotiated, to the extent those terms regulate their working
conditions under its control."

 Liebman indicates she would apply the entire contract to
the temporary workers. Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen asserts
"the higher standard of accretion must be met" if the board
adds employees to a pre-existing unit without a
representation vote. Finding the temporary workers do not
share an "overwhelming community of interests" with the
workers solely employed by Tree of Life, Hurtgen says the
temporary workers should not be accreted to the bargaining
unit. . . . Page AA-1 , Text-E-1

COURT REFUSES TO HALT ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE OVER FIRING
DECISIONS

A metal processing and distribution company's decision to
fire three striking workers was subject to the mandatory
arbitration provision of a collective bargaining agreement
ratified after the firing decision was made, a federal
district judge in Philadelphia rules ( "Metals USA Inc. v.
Sheet Metal Int'l Assoc. Local Union No. 119,  "E.D. Pa.,
No. 01-4365,  10/15/01).

Judge Shapiro of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania denies Metals USA's motion to
preliminarily enjoin arbitration of the dispute with Sheet
Metal Workers Local 119, finding the company unlikely to
prevail on the merits of its case. Even though the union was
aware of the firing decision before the agreement was
reached, neither the union nor the three fired workers
received sufficient notice of the identities of those being
fired until after the agreement took effect, the court
decides.  . . . Page A-1

FORMER HERE BUSINESS AGENT FAILS IN CHALLENGE TO LOCAL
TRUSTEESHIP

A former union business agent who was removed from his post
with a Pittsburgh local after the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees International Union came under federal
supervision cannot seek monetary damages under the
Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act's trusteeship
provision, the Third Circuit rules ("Ross v. Hotel Employees
and Restaurant Employees Int'l Union, "3d Cir., No. 00-3124,
9/17/01). The trusteeship provision--Title III of the
LMRDA-- does not "allow a private cause of action for
individual damages flowing from the termination of an
appointed employee," the Third Circuit finds in a case of
first impression.

 Relief under that provision "must be sought on behalf of
the local union organization and the entire membership must
reap the benefits," the court says. "Nothing in the
legislative history of Title III suggests that Congress
contemplated an individual bringing suit for compensatory
damages arising from the loss of an appointed union position
under that title," the court determines. "The statutory
scheme of the LMRDA strongly suggests that the individual
rights" the former agent "seeks to vindicate must be
redressed under Title I," which, the court says, was added
to the law specifically to address the rights of individual
union members. . . . Page A-8

OAS LABOR MINISTERS BACK ENDORSEMENT OF ILO LABOR RIGHTS
CONVENTIONS

The unanimous support of labor ministers of the Americas for
endorsing key International Labor Organization conventions
on basic labor rights and child labor represents a
significant commitment to taking action on these issues,
Canadian Labor Minister Claudette Bradshaw says.

That commitment and the inclusion for the first time of
employer and worker representatives in developing common
labor policy directions are historic steps in adding a
social dimension to the processes of globalization and trade
liberalization, Bradshaw tells reporters at the conclusion
of the 12th Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor.
"It's a new beginning," she says.

The labor ministers' agreement to support ILO standards is
an important step, but adoption of the standards is
meaningless unless the OAS member countries also put in
place effective enforcement to ensure that the standards are
actually met, says Canadian Labour Congress Vice President
Hassan Yussuff. "It's a tremendous accomplishment if we can
adopt them and enforce them," he says. . . . Page A-2

MASSACHUSETTS AGENCY ALLOWS COMPLAINTS BY TRANSGENDERED
EMPLOYEES

In two separate rulings, the Massachusetts Commission
Against Discrimination endorses bringing complaints of
discrimination against transgendered employees under state
bias laws aimed at both sex and disability bias, but not
under a law outlawing sexual orientation discrimination
("Jette v. Honey Farms Mini Market, "Mass. Comm'n Against
Discrimination, No. 95 SEM 0421, 10/11/01; "Millett v. Lutco
Inc., "Mass. Comm'n Against Discrimination, No. 98 BEM 3695,
10/11/01).

The commission rules in separate cases brought by
male-to-female transsexuals that investigators can consider
claims based on sex and disability discrimination because
the statutory language does not specifically exclude such
claims. A claim based on sexual orientation, however, is not
possible, the commission says, because the statute
specifically lists orientations, and transgenderism is not
one of the listed possibilities.

The commission says federal and state courts have expanded
the concept of sex and gender discrimination and that the
"continual evolution and expansion" of the law has gone
beyond questions of anatomy and into the realms of gender
and appearance. . . . Page A-3

I think this covers it.  The one issue that you may want to clarify is that the second termination option would entail payouts over time, until the termination of the fund, which Gene believes may have some real value.  Michelle

Subject:	EIP Incentive Plan

Hello everyone,

Attached is a summary write-up I've prepared on the EIP Plan (it's origin, current status and why we feel it s/b terminated) to deliver to Mary Joyce for her conversation with Mark Frevert.  I felt it a good idea to summarize all on one piece of papaer  in case Marke Frevert was not familar with the Plan.  This Plan is pretty intense when even intimate with it's details!

Sheila/Michelle, could you pls. both review prior to me delivering to Mary to see if I've missed anything or am describing anything incorrectly.  Pam is out today.  I appreciate it.  After your review I'll deliver.  I feel it's going to be very critical to get Mark's support on this to take it to the "termination" level, so I want this to go smoothly.

I'm also going to dabble around with a few "settlement payout" scenarios, based on the actual fund size, original expectations, remaining participants, etc.  I'll send to you for review and we'll have in our back pocket when it's time to talk to Gene.

Thanks all!

Susan

Perhaps it would be useful for me to discuss this with you and Kelly, as I know that you are aware of and appreciate my concerns.  Thanks a lot.  Michelle

Kelly, 
A part of the Management Committee presentation, we will need the DATA as part of 'business case'.  Michelle Cash and I have discussed using Jeanerette to calculate the standard deviations.  I was hoping to get the clearance from Mary Joyce to prepare and provide the data.  As you can see, from the original note of Oct. 8th I am at a standstill and am positive I cannot get this information turned around, analyzed and ready as a part of the presentation by Friday noon, per your request.

So I will prepare a proposed presentation without the data.  I hope to get this resolved shortly.   Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.

Spoke with Delainey this morning he suggested I draft below and send to him and Greg. Can you help critique (in particular I think this is too detailed);


******************************************************************************************************************************

To: All ENE employees (bar EEL)
>From : ENE OTC
Re: Year-end Performance Evaluations, Promotion Nominations, PRC Meetings and Annual Bonus process.

Many of you have asked for clarification on upcoming  changes to the PRC which were announced as a result of the  Lay-it-on-the-Line survey.  We have outlined the process and changes below to provide you with a clearer picture of how it will be administered for year-end 2001.  Additional communications will follow from each of your BU OTC's or Functional leads regarding the specific details the process as it affects each BU and Functional area. 


Feedback and Performance Evaluations
The ENE OTC believes strongly that all employees should receive a written evaluation summarizing their achievements over the last 6 months and illustrating successes and constructive areas for development and opportunity. We do not intend for the written evaluation to replace the critical day-to-day communication, coaching and feedback that we expect supervisors to provide to all employees throughout the year.  Our 360 feedback process will be administered as follows: 

 Summary of Process	 Timeframe	 Applicable to	 Notable changes from the past	
360 degree feedback via PEP System 	System open 9 November through 30 November 	ALL full time/part time/reduced hours employees who joined Enron prior to 1 October 2001	None	
Managers collate feedback for final written performance evaluation- balancing their views with the data received in feedback   	Final evaluations due no later than 31 January 2002			
Final evaluation should contain any appropriate objectives for the next 6 months 				
								

Employee training on the PEP system and application will be available from 5-9 November.  Please contact XXX (Elspeth - who do we use as a POC? - GUS?)  to register. 

PRC Meetings and Promotion nominations
The Lay-it-on-the-Line survey memo outlined our desire to make some changes and refinements to the PRC process. Enron management strongly believes  in the value of regular discussions about our talent.  As a management team we need to review and identify what performance and skills are currently valuable at Enron, and, on a relative basis, where they are being demonstrated most.  Likewise we need to discuss deployment of our talent and identify who among our employees may be ready to assume a greater role in the organization.  Equally important is the identification of  areas where overall performance may be lacking. Continuing the PRC process is core to our desire to maintain a meritocractic culture and to identify new opportunities for employees. 
In this regard, and particularly in light of significant business matters we must attend to in the coming months the ENE OTC has directed Business Units and Functional areas to undertake a very limited number of PRC discussions. initial discussions with senior management indicated  a reduction to no more than  22 meetings in total, down from over 200 at the mid year 2001.
The refined PRC process will focus on the following:

Summary of Process 	Timeframe	Applicable to	Notable changes from the past	
Each BU or Functional area will  conduct one discussion to identify its top and bottom 10% of employees 	28 November - 14 December 	Managers and above and all Analysts and Associates 	No preferred distribution	
Criteria for discussions are: --Leadership potential  --Teamwork --Enron intrinsic skills    and qualities --BU/Functional area   specific measures	VP/MD discussions occur in mid-December	All other employees are not required to be discussed in this forum	Process not linked to employee feedback - no label attached to final written evaluation 	
Promotion nominations  to Senior Director decided by each BU/Functional area		Promotion recommendations for all other employees by supervisor to BU OTC or Functional lead	No longer primary driver of bonus process	
Results of meetings reviewed with the ENE OTC			Purpose of meetings is to identify promotion candidates; leadership potential, deployment of talent within BU's and Functional areas  	
Management Committee will convene to discuss VP/MD  candidates for Promotion submitted from each BU or Functional area			No cross calibration of employees at the Manager-Sr. Director level outside of their BU's or Functional areas.  VP/MD's will be cross calibrated across the company.  	
			No prescribed outcome on top and bottom 10%

RYAN'S STEAK HOUSES' ARBITRATION PACT UNENFORCEABLE, APPEALS
COURT FINDS

The Seventh Circuit finds unenforceable an agreement
employees hired by Ryan's Family Steak House in Indiana were
required to sign with an arbitration service. The
obligations of Employment Dispute Services Inc. are so vague
and general that the agreement is unenforceable, the court
rules ("Penn v. Ryan's Family Steak Houses Inc., "7th Cir.,
No. 00-2355, 10/17/01).

 Judge Diane P. Wood finds the contract between Ryan's food
server Craig Penn and EDS was "hopelessly vague and
uncertain as to the obligation EDS has undertaken" and that
EDS "could fulfill its promise by providing Penn and Ryan's
with a coin toss." Finding the contract unenforceable, the
court affirms a district court's denial of Ryan's motion to
compel arbitration of Penn's claims of disability harassment
and retaliation.

 Penn worked as a food server at a Ryan's in Fort Wayne,
Ind., from 1996 until 1998 when he was fired. He filed a
suit under the Americans with Disabilities Act charging that
Ryan's maintained a hostile work environment and that he was
fired for complaining about harassment. When Penn was
initially hired by Ryan's, he was required to sign a
contract with EDS to have EDS provide an arbitration forum
for all employment-related disputes with Ryan's.  Relying on
Indiana law, the court says the contract between EDS and
Penn lacked mutuality of obligation and contained only an
"unascertainable, illusory promise" by EDS while placing
significant obligations on the employee. . . . Page AA-1,

COURT LIMITS SEX BIAS CLASS ACTION AGAINST BOEING TO SEATTLE
AREA

A federal judge in Washington state certifies a class of
some 30,000 female Boeing Co. employees who allege they were
discriminated against in job assignments, promotions,
training, retention, and bonuses ("Beck v. Boeing Co., "W.D.
Wash., No. C00-301P, 10/19/01).

The class of hourly employees--represented by the
International Association of Machinists--and nonexecutive,
salaried employees are employed at facilities in the Puget
Sound area of Washington. The plaintiffs had originally
sought to represent 42,000 workers nationwide, including
employees in St. Louis, Wichita, Kan., and Long Beach,
Calif., but Judge Pechman of the U.S. District Court for the
Western District of Washington limits the class to improve
manageability, calling the sweep of the proposed class
"immense."

Boeing has been the subject of two other class actions
alleging bias by African American and Asian American
employees. In 1999, a court awarded $14.2 million to the
black plaintiffs, and the second suit is still pending. . .

NLRB RULES 2-1 ILLEGAL CONFIDENTIALITY RULE REQUIRES NEW
ELECTION

Freund Baking Co.'s maintenance of a personnel handbook
provision illegally barring employees from discussing wages,
hours, and other terms and conditions of employment requires
setting aside a representation election, National Labor
Relations Board rules 2-1 ("Freund Baking Co., "336 N.L.R.B.
No. 75, 10/1/01 [released 10/22/01]). Ordering that a third
election be held in the longrunning case, Members Truesdale
and Walsh agree with a hearing officer that employees could
reasonably interpret the confidentiality provision "as
prohibiting them from discussing their wages and working
conditions with a union, as well as with others outside of
the company." Going one step farther than the hearing
officer, the board finds the provision could reasonably be
construed as prohibiting workers from discussing terms and
conditions of employment with other employees.

Chairman Hurtgen agrees the handbook rule is illegal.
However, Hurtgen, finding no evidence that the rule was used
to punish employees' protected activities, asserts that
maintenance of the rule did not merit setting aside the
election. Local 119 of the Bakery, Confectionery, and
Tobacco Workers lost the second election by a 30-3 vote. . .

SIXTH CIRCUIT FINDS TVA NUCLEAR SECURITY WORKERS NOT EXEMPT
FROM FLSA

The Tennessee Valley Authority willfully violated the Fair
Labor Standards Act by denying overtime pay to 20 former
nuclear power security employees, the Sixth Circuit rules
("Ale v. TVA, "6th Cir., No. 99-6642, 10/17/01). Despite
having some supervisory duties, the workers could not be
fairly characterized as bona fide executive and
administrative employees exempt from the overtime
requirements of FLSA, the court decides.

The 20 former employees, who alleged TVA had eliminated
their right to overtime compensation, had worked in site
security offices at TVA's Watts Bar and Sequoyah nuclear
power plants. Regardless of TVA's position descriptions and
other paperwork, the employees' actual duties did not
support the exempt classification, the appeals court says.
"The words 'in charge' are not a magical incantation that
render an employee a bona fide executive regardless of his
actual duties," the appeals court adds. . . . Page A-3

DRIVER TAKING ANTI-SEIZURE MEDICINE NOT 'QUALIFIED' UNDER
ADA, COURT SAYS

A commercial truck driver who was terminated after his
employer discovered he was taking anti-seizure medication
and had a history of "seizures, fits, convulsions or
fainting" has no claim under the Americans with Disabilities
Act because he was not "qualified" for the job, the Tenth
Circuit decides ("Tate v. Farmland Industries Inc.", 10th
Cir., No. 99-6329, 10/10/01). The court says even if Charles
Tate could show he had a disability under the ADA, he could
not meet a Farmland Industries Inc. job requirement of
compliance with Department of Transportation certification
criteria. "We hesitate to second-guess a legitimate business
judgment on the part of DOT and its covered employers as to
the necessary qualifications of CMV operators," Judge
Baldock writes.

In dissent, Judge Briscoe argues Farmland admitted in
pretrial discovery that Tate was "qualified" as a truck
driver, and the company should not be allowed to argue the
contrary without withdrawing its earlier admission. Tate
should be able to pursue his claim because Farmland regarded
him as disabled and violated the ADA by firing him based on
that perception, Brisco adds. . . . Page A-4

I don't think the plan would call for an employee to withdraw from litigation to be eligible for benefits--just that the employee sign the waiver.  Then, I think that in the employee's lawsuit we'd argue that the waiver released the claims and that the claims should be dismissed.

Rick or Cole,

PR received the following question.  We'd like to have an answer prepared, but don't plan to post it or include it in any of the Q&A that will accompany scripts.  (You may want to include it in an HR Q&A or post to LiveLink.)

Q.  If I am a party to a 401K class action suite against Enron, how will that affect my severance if I am involuntarily terminated?

Related Q.  If I am involuntarily terminated and required to sign a waiver as part of the severance package, can I participate in an employee or shareholder class action suite against Enron.

Michelle,
 
Mary Joyce, David Oxley, and myself discussed the potential exposure of the sick pay policy in light of the WARN notice essentially being "working at home".  Therefore, we wanted to address with you the possibility of adding exclusion to the sick policy for this situation.  Let's discuss; please call me at your convenience at 52407.

The plan documents sent yesterday are what has been faxed already to the Board today as you will all recall I had a 1:00 pm deadline today.  Therefore, someone needs to take the ball and run with it to determine which documents need to be executed when the Office of the Chair makes a decision this week.    Thanks.

Subject: Revised Restated Plan Docucments; 1 of 2
Attached is one of the plan documents that has been revised in the following manner: 

The beginning of Section 3.2 was revised to include a "subject to" provision. 

Section 3.4 was separated into two parts.  Part A is the original provision.  Part B is a new provision. 

Using this revised design, every laid off employee, whether subject to WARN, would receive the same net amount of severance benefit, whether a WARN penalty had to be paid by the employer, whether a WARN notice was given in advance of layoff, or whether WARN did not apply to the lay off in any way. 

I've received a thumbs up from Michelle for the revisions, which are marked in the attached document to facilitate your review. 

Pat 

The second plan document will be sent as an attachment to a separate email.

Karen - RE the Q below -  
	Will I still receive severance if the company files bankruptcy?
Draft Answer - It is unlikely that severance payments would be continued.   Current or former employees of a bankrupt entity are generally considered as unsecured creditors, in line with other unsecured creditors.  Employee claims will generally be represented through a court designated trustee.

Subject:	RE: A few questions about the scripts

Mary, based on the most current information:  
1.	A&B employees will receive bonus consideration however the amount is not dependant or determined by their A / B designation.   Accordingly, any mention of bonus in the scripts will need to rely on what we have said in the past, I.E. Bonus will be dependant on financial performance and employee contributions over the past year.  
As result of this interpitation, Bonus, albeit a element of retention, should not be included as an inducement to retention at this time.  (source - Aaron Brown) 
2.	The employees on the D - list are being placed on paid furlough and being terminated at a known date in the future.  That period of earning calculated to be a severance plan offset.   Employees who work up to their specific term date ( C-list) will be receiving their normal pay; then their severance pay, without a severance plan offset.  Michelle Cash is working with Pat Mackin to define the severance plan features that will govern this timing and the corresponding explanations.

I have a couple of questions about the scripts that Rick Johnson sent me

1.  For A and B employees, will there be bonuses.  It's crossed out on the A script and left in the B script.
2.  In the C script:
	Please explain what a 60-day notice w/o severance plan off-set means.
	When does severance go into effect for C employees?  It's not clear in the script.

Michelle,

I've been working with Pat on a separate Waiver of Benefits agreement for our employees on a dual payroll system with the UK/US (Oxley, Kitchen and Pickering).  Somehow the waiver was never put in place for David and Louise when they came over.  I discovered this when working on the package for Pickering.  

David has agreed to take the agreement to Louise and Mark, once he is comfortable.  We've gone back and forth with David a couple of times.  He now says he'll sign if we take out item 1 and the last sentence of 4. 

I think we need item 1, but I've adjusted it on the attached to try to meet our needs.  David's concern is that the current wording puts "salt in the wounds" regarding the benefits they are giving up, or may give up in the future.  He wants to keep it simple.  

Please review and let Pat and I know your thoughts.

Regards,

I like that there is some sort of formal process based on peer group.  
 
I also like that they have made a decision to have ranking in the commercial groups.  It looks like they are being ranked to measure performance, not for compensation.  If so, then it would be nice for there to be some rough correlation to compensation.  If not, then what are the criteria for determining the bonus amounts?  If it is P&L and some other components, then let's specify what they are.  My biggest concern with all of this flexibility is that decisions will appear arbitrary with no clear basis for distinguishing between persons at the top of the bonus range and persons in the bottom.
 
On non-commercial, will there be a further breakdown within the 80?  If so, will those correlate to bonus amounts?  If not, same question as above.
 
I understand that market forces may drive many of these bonus decisions.  If so, then I believe that we simply should articulate them and be prepared to explain the bases for bonus payment amounts.
 
Promotion process looks good.
 
Assistants and clerks looks good, although it looks like OOC will decide bonus amounts.  If this is a fixed amount based on the rating, then that is ok.  Otherwise, if they are not pretty standardized, the same issues arise as above.  I
 
I expect that the same kinds of questions will arise for all business unit plans.
 
Hope this helps.  Let me know if you want to discuss or would like to talk through pay criteria.

Here is our plan on PRC. 

Assistants: 

Ranked 1,2,3 by supervisors - pay determined by Me and Louise.  No meetings. 

Non Commercial but in North America: 

Traditional ranking with the correct people addending the meetings.  Pay grid determined by OOC. 

Analysts and Associates 

Ranked as per Billy Lemmons %'s and then pay grid determined by OOC 
I would like to see 25% - 65% - 10%.  Billy disagrees.  This would provide for a quick meeting rather than trying to split them into 4 groups with the top one excluding some awesome people.

Managers/Directors 

Ranked from 1 to 100 in as many clusters as the groups see fit.  We are going to combine managers and directors into one table.  The ranking is based on this years performance is directly related to pay.  We will have two meetingss - one for traders and one for other commercial staff (orig/finance/etc).  We will not have a pay prc but will take the results of the rankings and work with individual leaders after the meetings to ensure the appropriate compensation.

We will also determine promotions during this meeting using different criteria. 

VP's 

We will rank all our VP's from 1 to 100 with a group of selected people - some VP's and some MD's.  
This too will be directly related to pay. 

Cheers as you Brits say

In developing the HR tier for the vacation policy I would like to mention the fact that employees will/may have to pay back vacation used before accrued.  What can I say?  They may or will have to pay it back?
Any differences between voluntary and involuntary terminations?

Thanks!

You may know that 130 Liberty Street was immediately across the street from World Trade Center 2, the so-called "south tower."  My understanding is that we are very fortunate to be able to report that our building and our offices in World Trade Center 4 were evacuated successfully.  However, that is not an official statement, and I have no additional information at this time.

Sadly, until further notice, the former 130 Liberty Street address cannot be used for any reason.  If you need to deliver correspondence or documentation of any kind that cannot be held pending discussion and/or further instruction, please deliver it in care of:

     Facsimile:     212-469-5630

Although I have no telephone at this time, it might be possible to reach me via David C. Rodriguez at 212-469-7116 or Doris Eagan at 212-469-5892.  Please keep in mind that we have access to no paper records at this time.

Additionally, because so many people have been affected by Tuesday's events and have had so many questions, I have taken the liberty of attaching a Microsoft Word document that contains a summer 2000 photograph of the area that shows the proximity of 130 Liberty Street to the World Trade Center.

Has anybody produced a 'disclosure policy' for the Data Protection Act or  a general policy on this subject?

If you could send me a copy i would appreciate it.

Also, the engineering constuction IR issue at Lundbeck chemicals, over 2nd tier payments, is, according to my sources unlikely to spread to other sites. However if you have any 'intelligence' on this subject, i would appreciate a call or an e-mail.

Michelle,

I've been working with Pat on a separate Waiver of Benefits agreement for our employees on a dual payroll system with the UK/US (Oxley, Kitchen and Pickering).  Somehow the waiver was never put in place for David and Louise when they came over.  I discovered this when working on the package for Pickering.  

David has agreed to take the agreement to Louise and Mark, once he is comfortable.  We've gone back and forth with David a couple of times.  He now says he'll sign if we take out item 1 and the last sentence of 4. 

I think we need item 1, but I've adjusted it on the attached to try to meet our needs.  David's concern is that the current wording puts "salt in the wounds" regarding the benefits they are giving up, or may give up in the future.  He wants to keep it simple.  

Please review and let Pat and I know your thoughts.

NLRB RULES 2-1 IMMIGRATION STATUS WAS 'SMOKESCREEN' TO FIRE
WORKERS

A California waste recycling facility used its employees'
immigration status as a "smokescreen" to illegally fire 11
union supporters following an election win by the
International Union of Operating Engineers, the National
Labor Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Nortech
Waste, "336 N.L.R.B. No. 79, 9/28/01 [released 10/24/01]).
Members Truesdale and Walsh agree with an administrative law
judge that Nortech Waste committed unfair labor practices by
contacting the Immigration and Naturalization Service a few
days after the election and telling 11 employees they could
not work until they straightened out their paperwork. The
company "significantly departed from its ordinary course of
business," belying its contention that it was merely trying
to comply with the Immigration Reform and Control Act, the
board finds.

Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen maintains Nortech did not fire
the 11 workers on Oct. 1, 1997. The company informed the
employees that it had contacted INS, that the workers had
three days to straighten out their paperwork, and that they
could not work in the meantime, Hurtgen finds. "The clear
implication was that, absent a satisfactory resolution with
INS, they "would be" discharged," the chairman says. . . .

REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE AFFILIATION BASED ON PETITION WAS ULP,
NLRB FINDS

A car parts manufacturer in Tawas City, Mich., violated
federal labor law when it refused to recognize its
employees' union as an affiliate of the United Auto Workers
after employees presented a petition signed by more than
two-thirds of the bargaining unit stating that they did not
want to be affiliated with the UAW, the National Labor
Relations Board rules in a 2-1 decision ("Tawas Ind. Inc.,
"336 N.L.R.B. No. 24,   9/28/01 [released 10/22/01]).

The Tawas Industries employees should have gone through
union channels to disaffiliate their union, Tawas
Independent Workers Association, from UAW, say Members
Leibman and Walsh. A "disaffiliation is a change in the
legal and institutional relationships between two unions. It
cannot be carried out externally to the unions," they find,
reversing a decision by an NLRB administrative law judge.
Dissenting, Chairman Hurtgen argues that the company did not
commit an unfair labor practice by refusing to recognize the
affiliation and accuses the majority of elevating "form over
substance.". . . Page A-2

COMPENSATION COSTS RISE 4.0 PERCENT FOR PRIVATE EMPLOYERS

Even as wage pressures moderated, higher benefit costs
helped to boost private industry employers' total
compensation costs by 4.0 percent over the year ended in
September, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.

The latest figures from the employment cost index show that
private industry wages climbed 3.6 percent over the 12
months ended in September, down from 3.8 percent in the year
ended in June. Benefit costs of private employers climbed
4.9 percent during the 12 months ended in September, about
the same as in the 12 months ended in June, and down
somewhat from the 6.0 percent jump over the year ended in
September 2000. . . . Page D-1

MINNESOTA HIGH SCHOOL ACCOMMODATED NEEDS OF MUSLIM HALL
MONITOR

Although cautioning about a need for religious sensitivity
in the workplace, a federal judge dismisses the claims of a
Somali Muslim who contended that the Rochester, Minn.,
public schools failed to accommodate his religious needs in
violation of federal and state civil rights laws ("Sheikh v.
Independent School District 535, "D. Minn., No. 00-1896,
10/18/01).

Judge Frank finds the school district responded quickly to
Mustaf Sheikh's request to wear his religious head gear, use
break time for prayer, and combine his breaks for Friday
attendance at a local mosque. Sheikh's allegations of
ostracism by his co-workers, although creating "an
unpleasant working environment," did not rise to the level
of actionable harassment, the court holds in dismissing the
discrimination claims under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and Minnesota law. . . . Page A-2

IMPAIRED LIVER FUNCTION NOT MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITY, SEVENTH
CIRCUIT SAYS

A technical director's liver function, which was impaired by
hepatitis B, was not a "major life activity" under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Seventh Circuit rules
(" Furnish v. SVI Sys. Inc., " 7th Cir.,  No. 99-2431,
10/22/01). The court affirms summary judgment for SVI
Systems Inc. in a suit brought by Kent Furnish.

"The activities that have been held to be major life
activities under the ADA (e.g., eating, working,
reproducing) are not the impairments' characteristics--they
are activities that have been impacted because of the
plaintiffs' impairments," Judge Kanne writes for the court.
"Therefore, we reject the notion that 'liver function' is a
major life activity under the ADA." . . . Page A-4

Mary & Pam -- Diomedes has sent me a number of messages this week asking about the status of the payment(s) under the ECI Buyout Agreement.  I have been putting him off now for several weeks but he is justifiably asking for an explanation as to what the issue is.  He is planning to be in Houston tomorrow and Friday and wanted to know who he could talk to about this, short of calling Ken Lay.  It may be most appropriate for him to simply call Ken but I'd like to know from you how you would you like to handle this.  

Based on my reading of the contract, I believe it is clear that we owe him (i.e., ECI) payments under the ECI contract and that we do not have the right to set off payments he owes us against payments we owe ECI.  The ECI contract provides interest on late payments of the greater of Chase's prime rate plus 2% or 14%, which interest is currently accruing on the past due amounts.  I think it would be helpful if we could arrange a call with some or all of the group copied on this email to discuss further how to proceed.  Thanks.

Regards,
	John

Michelle,
I have an employee that is supposed to terminate 1/4/02. I just received a call from Hector and he was telling me that we need to terminate all these employees effective today so we don't have to pay benefits for the month of January for these employees. I was not at that meeting last week and this was the first I have heard of this. I assume unless there is a business reason to keep someone around they will be terminated effective 12/31. This would have been easier to manage last week, but now since I have to call the employee and supervisor today and let them know that today will be this individuals last day. Please advise. 
Mandy

Michelle, 

I have an employee that wants out of his employment agreement.    He feels it was a mistake to sign it.  He is starting into his second year of the contract.   What are our options in this case?   He's willing to give up all the options given him and any future payments.   I promised him I wouldn't share his name with anyone.

Thanks Michelle - I will incorporate those changes and check with Lizzette.  I think Rick was just the messenger - I got the impression the group wanted procedures that were somewhat vague - not so many requirements.

Sarah, this does not strike me as too bureaucratic.  Exactly what were Rick's concerns?  Perhaps you could make it more of a "step by step" process instead of a paragraph.  One other thing -- we should have some sort of excuse for not calling if unable to due to impairment.  Also, if a person contacts a supervisor about a lengthy medical leave that is supported by a doctor's note, he should not have to call in every day.  You might want to check with Lizzette for some suggested language on this, as I believe she had some ideas.  
 
Thanks.

Subject: Sick Leave Procedure



SICK LEAVE POLICY 

Policy 

To keep the business and each department running smoothly and efficiently, it is important that every employee be on the job on time regularly.  For this reason, careful attention is given to promptness, absence record and overall dependability.

Enron recognizes, however, that an employee may occasionally be unable to come to work due to injury or illness.  As a result, the Sick Leave policy is designed to provide protection to employees against loss of income during pregnancy, illness or injury.

Eligible employees who are unable to perform their jobs due to pregnancy, illness or injury are eligible to receive sick leave pay for up to 1,040 hours (6 months) in a twelve month period, assuming certain procedures are followed.    Effective January 1, 2002, the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) runs concurrently with Enron's Sick Leave policy.  An employee who is still disabled after using the 1,040 hours of sick leave pay ends may qualify for long term disability insurance.  Sick days cannot be carried over from one calendar year to the next and employees are not paid for sick days either at the end of the calendar year or upon termination.  

Proposed Policy Link 

Procedures - 

To be eligible for sick leave pay, employees unable to report to work must telephone their supervisor directly, each day of their absence, as far in advance as possible.  If their supervisor is not available, the employee's human resources representative should be contacted.  If an employee is unable to make the call personally, a family member or a friend should contact the supervisor.  The supervisor or human resources representative must be contacted each day of absence.  An employee who fails to contact his/her immediate supervisor or human resources representative may forfeit the sick leave pay and may be considered as having voluntarily resigned.  This policy must be followed unless an exception has been made for a particular absence, and a written memo to this effect has been sent to the employees' human resources representative.

On the fifth day of continued absence due to injury or illness, in addition to notifying the employee's supervisor or human resources representative, the employee must also attain a doctor's certification indicating the estimated date in which the employee will be able to return to work.  Any absences exceeding 2 weeks will require a doctor's certification indicating that the employee is able to return to work.

The provisional agenda is:

Hiring protocol - agree wording. Suggestion: No severance payment from Enron, no 4 or 5 performers, and minimum 90 day sit out for all no-compete individuals.
Severance update: illustration of current and revised plans which we have yet to decide on.
Overview of Nov 27 areas of headcount reduction.
More detailed overview of HR planned re-structuring (still high level - although I would be interested in seeing if she is interested in any potentially redundant talent)
Overview of retention plan.

Please comment.

Tim/Scott, please help prepare pack I will need and make sure legal are ok with what we all agree to hand over to her on above.

Hi Michelle, 
Do you have any suggestions so that I can move forward in finalizing the data based on our discussion of having Jeanerette run the numbers?

Kelly, 
A part of the Management Committee presentation, we will need the DATA as part of 'business case'.  Michelle Cash and I have discussed using Jeanerette to calculate the standard deviations.  I was hoping to get the clearance from Mary Joyce to prepare and provide the data.  As you can see, from the original note of Oct. 8th I am at a standstill and am positive I cannot get this information turned around, analyzed and ready as a part of the presentation by Friday noon, per your request.

So I will prepare a proposed presentation without the data.  I hope to get this resolved shortly.   Please let me know if you have any questions.

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.    

Thanks. ay

Subject:	Enron payments




Mary Joyce,

 

I hope all is well with you. 

 

I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.

 

After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November". 

 

As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.

 

These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments,otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.

 

Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.

 

I look forward to hearing from you,

 

Regards,

 

 

Diomedes Christodoulou.

Michelle,

I do not think reinstatement is a settlement option we want to pursue.
We should, perhaps discuss other options, though.

I'll get duplicate copies to you for signature. The reason for doing this is more the former than the latter mentioned below.  However, there is a concern that other UK nationals remaining on the UK payroll could try to use the US non-discrimination rules to obtain US benefits, if you were provided both. Their success in such a challenge is questionable.

OK. Much better. Explain to me again why we have to do this? Is it purely to confirm we don't get stuff twice or is there a concern that our participation in both causes a sub-space paradox which may create a time vacuum into which the entire world population may be sucked?

Michelle/Diane, 
Assuming you received the updated file from Kathy, here's what I would like to see.

1.  Standard deviation by job group based on age, gender, ethnicity and performance rating
2.  Utilization of Forecast, Probability and/or Trend functions for age gender, ethnicity and performance rating to identify the likelihood of women and minorities promoted within the organization.. 

Please let me know if Jeanerette needs additional information.

That's the process we agreed to follow last week to vet the contract interpretation points, but my concern is that Diomedes will be in Houston tomorrow and I believe he plans to call Ken to complain.  The immediate action item for this group is to figure out whether there is a satisfactory explanation we can give Diomedes now or, if not, someone needs to call Ken asap and let him know to expect a phone call from Diomedes.

Rgds,
	John

Subject:	RE: ECI Payments

 		


We are working on this issue this week by meeting with Joe Dilg and putting forth a summary memo of the history of the situation, the pay requirements under the contract, and recommendations of how to move forward.  That will be done this week, and everyone on this email will be copied on it.  Michelle

Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Private

Mary & Pam -- Diomedes has sent me a number of messages this week asking about the status of the payment(s) under the ECI Buyout Agreement.  I have been putting him off now for several weeks but he is justifiably asking for an explanation as to what the issue is.  He is planning to be in Houston tomorrow and Friday and wanted to know who he could talk to about this, short of calling Ken Lay.  It may be most appropriate for him to simply call Ken but I'd like to know from you how you would you like to handle this.  

Based on my reading of the contract, I believe it is clear that we owe him (i.e., ECI) payments under the ECI contract and that we do not have the right to set off payments he owes us against payments we owe ECI.  The ECI contract provides interest on late payments of the greater of Chase's prime rate plus 2% or 14%, which interest is currently accruing on the past due amounts.  I think it would be helpful if we could arrange a call with some or all of the group copied on this email to discuss further how to proceed.  Thanks.

Regards,
	John

	Bad:	Jack is starting a 2-week trial on Nov. 		5 and won't be available 11/8 or 11/15 		-- the proposed dates for his 			presentation.
I know you want to avoid the rest of November because of holidays and PRC.  Do you want me to schedule him for early January?

Let me now....

This looks fine. I would suggest adding an acknowledgement at the bottom, where he person acepts the terms and conditions of the assignment letter and also authorizes the company to deduct the amounts described in theletter from final paycheck, vacation pay or other amounts to be paid to employee.

Subject: Enron payments


Mary Joyce,
 
I hope all is well with you. 
 
I am contacting you regarding a number of late payments by Enron which have now become urgent from my standpoint. These payments refer to contractual obligations between ECI (one of my affiliate companies) and Enron and to the Employment Contract between Enron and myself. The payments have been invoiced and they are months late now.
 
After questioning John Novak about the status of these payments (after leaving Enron I was told by Rob Walls to send all invoices related to the ECI and to my agreement with Enron to John Novak in Enron South America) I received a voice mail from Pam Buttler, who I believe works with you, informing me that I would have to wait until early November, maybe even until late November as the "changes in management at Enron require that all contracts be reviewed by the Compensation Committee which would convene in early or late November". 
 
As soon as I received this message last Wednesday I left a message with Pam and also a voice mail with you and I subsequently left two messages with your assistant asking you to contact me urgently regarding this very serious matter but as I have not heard from you I am writing this email to make sure that my position is clear.
 
These payments are due by Enron based on existing contracts and I see no reason why I have to wait for a review by an internal Compensation Committee. These payments are already significantly late and I have been extremely patient with continuous delays in payments due to me by Enron up to now. Moreover I have repeatedly let Enron know that I am in the process of closing a transaction which depends on receiving these payments, otherwise I would incur costs by unwinding other positions that I have. I need these payments to be made no later than Wednesday, October 24.
 
Please inform me of Enron's intents so that I can take all the appropriate steps to enforce my contractual rights.
 
I look forward to hearing from you,
 
Regards,
 
 
Diomedes Christodoulou.

I like that idea.  How about going down to Director level?  I have started maintaining a list of people who have expressed an interest in diversity regardless of gender or ethnicity and will also include their names.

Andrea, I appreciate your protection!  Why not give them the names of several individuals who would be supportive of those events, including Hispanic VPs as well as others who have expressed an interest in diversity initiatives.  Plus, you could include some people who are not VPs per se, but may be attorneys (Coralina Rivera comes to mind) or other fairly senior level personnel.  That way, you are not necessarily revealing the diverstiy information, but are providing them with a great set of resources.
 
Do you think that will work?  If not, then I wouldn't have too much heartburn about giving them the names.  I just think that the prior approach would be better.

Hi Michelle, 
I had a meeting today with Kelly Kimberly, Misha Siegal, Calvin Eakin, Jennifer Medcalf, Lauren Iannarone to share information about diversity initiatives.  There are several Hispanic events where GSS would like to invite representation at the senior level along with key vendors and the only person they are aware of is Dennis Vegas.  I was asked to identify senior level hispanics so that the invitations can be extended to them.  I came up with 12 hispanic VP's.  Can I share those names with GSS?  I would actually like to have a few guidelines on what to share and what not to share.  I'm pretty protective of HR information, but want to be extra cautious. 

Thanks... ay

Should we consider the backup childcare as an emergency measure?  What do you think?

Subject:	RE: Non-Compete Language


Sheila,

Several follow up comments/questions:

1) On the carve-out for investment banking, the restriction on similar transactions is very broad, particularly given the general applicability of the deals we work on - raising capital in the 144A, public or debt markets, corporate revolvers, leasing, monetizations, etc..  I would agree that I should not be able to work on a deal that I was working on as a direct competitor (say ENE was executing a pre-pay with a client - I would not be able to go to an investment bank and compete for the same deal), but to put in a restriction on general corporate finance type activity seems overly broad.  Can you confirm that the concept is that not to compete on deals I have been working on.

2) I would like to discuss the assignment language further.  I do not have an issue with assignment to an affiliate, my issue is with the ability to assign to any other entity.  Based on how the contract is drafted, ENE could assign the contract to anyone, including in the extreme say 7-Eleven.  Not that I would expect this to happen and I understand that I would be getting paid during the time period, however, the work that I could be doing or firm working for, could make me unemployable beyond the contract period.  I am signing this contract and agreeing to stay with ENE or an affiliate, not any other entity.  What is the definition of affiliate (is this the same as used in the typical ENE docs, which ties to control) ?

3) On vesting.  My view is that I am signing a 2 year contract and the compensation should vest during that period (i.e. 1/3 now, 1/3 after 1 year and 1/3 at the end of the 2nd year, or 50% after yr. 1 and 50% after yr. 2) I would like to discuss your thoughts on this issue.

Thanks,

George

George, talked with Legal and the determination is as follows: 

	Employee would be able to work for other companies but would not be able to work on similar transactions for the non-compete period.  

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Subject:	RE: 


as a clarification:

- based on the language below, if I took a position as an investment banker for a firm such as Barclays, CSFB, a hedge fund, a consulting firm or venture capital firm (i.e. not a company such as El Paso), I would not be prohibited from working on deals (even deals that are similar to those I worked on for Enron) for companies involved in the busineses outlined in section 3.4 a thru d. ?

the distinction is important because the types of firms listed above are involved in many of the activities involved in section 3.4 a thru d, with clients that are involved in these activities.

Thanks,

George

Mary, 
We are currently in the process of doing diversity analysis with the Mid-Year 2001 PRC data.  We will also have the Jeanerette group run the standard deviations.  Since I have taken on the EEO/AAP responsibility, Michelle and I agree that the HR data needs to be incorporated into the analysis and will need your approval for me to get access to the information.   Please let me know what I need to do to get clearance.  Our target is to get the information ready by Thursday but will need at least a day to consolidate the information.    

Thanks. ay

Options
I don't see a path to ask questions about the merger, so I'm submitting here.  Will the merger ratio be applied to our option strike prices as well?  (e.g., for Enron options with a strike price of around $84, will the new strike price of these options be multiplied by .2685 for a new strike price of $22.55 in the new company's stock?)

Cost Savings
I moved to 3 Allen Center about a year and a half ago and was assigned a new phone number.  However, I occasionally receive forwarded calls from my old number (853-4792, I think).  It appears two direct dial numbers are being maintained for me, and likely for all employees who ever had an EB number and moved to 3AC.  We could save some money by getting rid of the old numbers.

Thanks,

This is too funny !


Many women are afraid of their first mammogram, but
there is no need to worry.  By taking a few minutes
each day for a week preceding the exam and doing the
following exercises, you will be totally prepared
for the test and best of all, you can do these
simple
exercises right in your home.

EXERCISE ONE:

Open your refrigerator door and insert one breast in

door. Shut as hard as possible and lean on the door
for
good measure. Hold that position for five seconds.
Repeat again in case the first time wasn't effective
enough.

EXERCISE TWO:

Visit your garage at 3AM when the temperature of the

cement floor is just perfect.  Take off all your
clothes
and lie comfortably on the floor with one breast
wedged
under the rear tire of the car. Ask a friend to
slowly
back the car up until your breast is sufficiently
flattened and chilled.
Turn over and repeat with the other breast.

EXERCISE THREE:

Freeze two metal bookends over night. Strip to the
waist. Invite a stranger into the room. Press the
bookends against one of your breasts.
Smash the bookends together as hard as you can. Set
up an appointment with the stranger to meet next
year
and do it again.

YOU ARE NOW TOTALLY PREPARED!

AND, just a thought for all the women out
there.........
MENtal illness, MENstrual cramps, MENtal breakdown,
MENopause.. Ever notice how all of women's problems
start with men?....and when we have real trouble,
it's
HYSterectomy!!!

Send this to all the women you know and brighten
their
day!!! AND, don't forget to have a mammogram

Michelle,

I have been working with Diane Goode over the past two months regarding the
online computer based compliance training that we provide. I understand that
moving forward Diane has asked me to follow up directly with you in regards
to the project.

I will be in Houston on the 29th - 30th of this month if their is a need for
us to meet to discuss the project. As of late Diane has informed me that you
still need to view the courseware prior to moving forward. Please let me
know if I can assist in this area. I will follow up with you by weeks end to
get a update from you regarding the project.

I look forward to speaking soon.

Does the new PRC Rankings Policy of only the top 10% and the bottom 10% will be reviewed by the Enron Office of the Chairman mean that only the top 10% of employees will be considered for promotions? Will the bottom 10% be asked to leave the company, if yes, then will we stick to it at all levels, especially Sr. Dir, VP & MD?

Dave Maxey invited us to join him and Ann Marie at the opera on November 3 --

Tannh?user 
Opera in three acts
Music and libretto by Richard Wagner
Sung in German with English surtitles

He suggested doing the dinner first (starts around 5:30, he thinks) -- they have 4 Founders Box seats.  He also granted permission to leave earlier if the Wagner was too much to take after two acts.

I told him I did not know what we had on the schedule, and I would check with you.  Let's discuss when we visit next.

L, T

Hi Michelle, 

The original fax I sent to you on Friday are the only names that John wanted the letters for.  I misread the paper and did 4 extra people by mistake.  EEEK!  Anyway - I think he may want some revisions today, so please let me know if you are making any adjustments or changes to the documents from Friday!  Thank you!

Subject:	REVISED - Policy Changes


Attached is the latest draft of a memo outlining the changes to severance, vacation, et al.  While I know that we don't have a decision on severance, Michelle Cash and I have discussed most likely only being able to include a link to the restated plan.  If we do that, any language in the memo related to severance will be very generic.  I've also added information about the suspension of the Educational Assistance Program.  (Q: Rick, is the cut off date Nov. 2002, or should it be 2001?)  Let me know your thoughts when possible.  We'd like to send this as soon as we get word from David that a plan has been selected.

 << File: Policy change notice email.doc >> 
Michelle, when we know which plan is selected, we'd still like to have some summary language/talking points we can provide HR generalists and supervisors to help them briefly explain the plan as they are talking with employees.
