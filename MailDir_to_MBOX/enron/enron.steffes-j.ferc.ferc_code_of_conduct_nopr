Subject:	Update on Timing of Proceedings

As Project Lead of one or more of the proceedings that are currently underway at FERC, would you please send to this group a timeline (date of filing or date of FERC issuance, due date for comments, estimated date for FERC action) for each of the proceedings that you are the assigned lead.  For example, for RTO Week, the timeline would be:


Project:  RTO Week

RTO Week									October 15-19

Comments on RTO Week							November 3

Estimated Date for Draft Circulation (and who is responsible for the first draft)	November 1 (Sarah will write the first draft)

Estimated Date for FERC Action							Mid-December (which could be in the form of additional proceedings, such as a NOPR)


Because we have so many proceedings pending, and because FERC continues to change the dates for interventions and comments, this information will allow us all to keep on top of what needs to be done.

Please send your responses to this group by COB Wednesday.

Thanks

Sarah

FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) asks that we "provide factual evidence on the costs and benefits" of extending the affiliate code of conduct to bundled service.  To provide this evidence, we are asking members to provide incidents/anecdotes for EPSA's comments on the NOPR.  EPSA recognizes that some examples may include confidential data, so please feel free to eliminate any identifying data (i.e., name of counterparties, etc.) and to use general terms (e.g., "Control Area A").  Such factual evidence will help us to make a stronger argument in our comments.  Please send any information to Jackie Gallagher at jgallagher@epsa.org as soon as possible.
