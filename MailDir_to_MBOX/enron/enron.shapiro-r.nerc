Jim, 

I've tried to give you some language addressing Enron's support for other security measures and differentiating the pipeline and electric gird cases.  We can tighten up the wording later, if needed.  Hope this is helpful.  Cheers.

Subject:	Electric Grid Security Issues

What security measures with regard to the electric grid does Enron support?

NERC remains in Full Alert Status.  Per the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Ananlysis Center (ES-ISAC), suggested actions at Full Alert may include:  selected maintenance curtailment; selected additional generation reserves in various states of readiness; staffing of backup control facilities; examination of connections of computers to outside communications, including the Internet and modems; and maintenance of close coordination with first responders, local law enforcement, and the local FBI.  In case of a specific threat to the grid, operators are prepared to shut down the interface to maintain local control of transmission and to change generation dispatch patterns.  ENRON SUPPORTS ALL OF THESE ACTIONS, AS APPROPRIATE.

Does Enron's position on information flow about electric grids contradict its stance on restricting certain information about gas pipeline operations for security reasons?  

No.  Certain pipeline information that could be used to identify the physical location of assets has been restricted to those within the industry.  Pipeline information important for the operation of gas markets remains available to market participants.  The NERC action, however, restricts electric gird information even to market participants who need it in order to ensure the efficient operation of the wholesale electricity market.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.

WEB SITES REMOVE DOCUMENTS
U.S. government departments and agencies also have been stripping a wide range of documents from Web sites in recent days because of perceived threats to such critical systems as pipelines, water supply stations and power plants. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, for instance, took down its entire Web site Thursday to review its content for "information that might be useful to adversaries," said spokeswoman Rosetta Virgilio. 
She said many other federal agencies also appeared to be in the process of removing such information from their sites. 
The Transportation Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics has cut off public access to databases used for mapping because of stepped-up concern about U.S. transportation infrastructure. 
The Environmental Protection Agency has dismantled its risk-management Web site, which contains general information about emergency plans and chemicals used at 15,000 sites nationwide.

Andy. I do not know who Gordon is nor his connections with the rest of the ESC group so I cannot gage the effect of your proposed e-mail to him. This is what I know:

The BOT wanted some immediate action, the NERC staff was under pressure (criticism) at the meeting. The inclusion of the ESC mention was an attempt to latch-on to some positive development. NERC wanted to be linked with it and not be left out, (where this effort may be re-directed to EISB for continuation)  Some stakeholders smelled a rat, and wanted to link NERC's link to this effort to a new committee voting structure; therefore  items 7, 8, and 9 were modified to reflect these comments,  and this is how the resolution came out below (see below).

The next step will be at FERC to decide how the OASIS 2 work is to continue and under whose leadership. It may not be under the existing ESC group or a reformulation of it. 

Next week (Tuesday)  I would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to ESPA

Jose
	


Resolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards 
(Board Agenda Item 20)

WHEREAS, Reliability standards developed by NERC, relying on the expertise of industry experts, have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over 30 years; and

WHEREAS, With the opening of the transmission systems, the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities, and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers, NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair, open, balanced and inclusive; and

WHEREAS, To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large RTOs, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids, it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards; and

WHEREAS, NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards, including spearheading the OASIS "What" and "How" working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC), which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase 2); and 

WHEREAS, the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERC's future Organization Standards will be based; and 

WHEREAS, NERC is recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America, and

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards; and

WHEREAS, the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards;

BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that NERC:

1.	Take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards through a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process, and to file such standards with FERC and appropriate government agencies in Canada.

2.	Actively solicit cooperation, collaboration, and support from Canadian and U.S. government entities to establish NERC as the single organization in North America for the development of reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards.

3.	Take immediate action to adopt and implement the six Initial Recommendations of the Standing Committee Representation Task Force contained in Board Agenda Item 22.

4.	Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, and on a course of action to institute such capabilities.

5.	Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations.

6.	Build on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process.

7.	Recommend that FERC use the ESC report, which has already been submitted to FERC, as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards.

8.	Urge FERC to make use of the ESC, which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board, for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards, including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services.

9.	Commit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework.

Subject:	RE: BOT Support for the ESC and Sector Voting

Charles, Jose, Jim, and Rick, 

I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC.  Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the "new sector weighted voting model" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?

Andy



Gordon,

When did the ESC vote to adopt the  "new sector weighted voting model?"  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?

Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  

Of course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don't think NERC can just "annex" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.  

Other members of the ESC - do you share this concern?

Having watched the whole string of e-mails on this issue, I fully agree with Andy's observations and those of others who have made similar statements. In response to Andy's(and Dave Perrino's) question as to whether we respond to the BS of NERC, absolutely..We should call them on this shameless use of an American tragedy...we should correct them on the facts and use this as an opportunity to highlight their inexcusable and baseless  manipulation of the WTC tragedy. NERC ought to be ashamed of itself.

Christi,

This is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever heard.  NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning.  They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position.

In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices.  They are in a shopping mall.  How secure is that?  Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open.  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers.  

Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit.  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure.

Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous.  That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail.  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter.   

I echo Dave's question - do we want to "call" NERC on this issue?  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on.  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud.

(By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of "NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards"?  Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle.  Next they'll say that the 60 in "2600" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)

Our NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making statements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comments in these document look more like "this should be reviewed".)
Do we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group perform a study that includes redunancy issues, etc. to counter this?  Certainly, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell's testimony to Congress indicate that they believe that large RTOs will bring more security and reliability (we have included this in our SE RTO mediation comments.)

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. 

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

The following includes Charles' suggestions for tightening up the language of the last two sentences of the first paragraph:

What security measures with regard to the electric grid does Enron support?

NERC remains in Full Alert Status.  Per the Electricity Sector Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ES-ISAC), suggested actions at Full Alert may include:  selected maintenance curtailment; selected additional generation reserves in various states of readiness; staffing of backup control facilities; examination of connections of computers to outside communications, including the Internet and modems; and maintenance of close coordination with first responders, local law enforcement, and the local FBI.  In case of a specific threat to the grid, operators may take actions that include reducing transfers across interfaces to increase local control of generation dispatch patterns.  ENRON SUPPORTS ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SAFEGUARD THE GRID FROM ATTACKS.

Does Enron's position on information flow about electric grids contradict its stance on restricting certain information about gas pipeline operations for security reasons?

No.  Certain pipeline information that could be used to identify the physical location of assets has been restricted to those within the industry.  Pipeline information important for the operation of gas markets remains available to market participants.  The NERC action, however, restricts electric grid information even to market participants who need it in order to ensure the efficient operation of the wholesale electricity market.

We need to discuss in our Tuesday Call.

1) Who is the intended audience of these points? NERC? or outside NERC about NERC?  The message has to be tailored to the audience.

There are people in various places DOE, NERC, NIPC, some utilities, that feel empowered by the events. We do not want to belittle their concerns, we want to expose them to ridicule when they do not use their brain,

NERC is still the only game in town, We need to guide them to be truly impartial in the electric utility restructuring, but also be ready to expose the abuse of their Information monopoly position.

Do we work from within? or launch our missiles to attack their standing?

What is the role of the MIC in regards to this issue within NERC?


2) Central Repository of Data. I wanted to discuss this point to determine if we should lobby to strengthen this system or let it die through neglect?. The key is that the institution that hold access to this information has power.

3) Actions with DOE. The one that was more concerning to me, is the perspective of some coordinators to "play it conservatively"; I interpret it as, refusing to schedule some market transactions.

4) RTOs. Tome Bowe of PJM blasted the NERC staff  at the meeting when he got hold of the Energy Daily article.

Charles,

Some comments.  I removed some words I though made NERC look too respectable/official, embellished some of your points, added a section on RTO security risk, and added some stronger "chastisement" words at the end.  They may be too strong, but I think the paper needs to be assertive.  Out of curiosity, is there an intended audience?  If it is NERC, maybe the more passive approach is preferable, but if it is anyone else, then maybe the aggressiveness would be a good thing. I think we want to make sure the audience finishes by looking at NERC and shaking their head in disgust, rather than sighing and shrugging their shoulders.  Of course, that could backfire and make us look like we're unfairly attacking NERC without any provocation, especially given the esoteric nature of some of our points.

Thoughts?

Kevin

Here is a summary of the work of this task force.  Bill Rust has been 
attending  the meetings and I have been closley coordinating our positions.

The PFTF set out to develop a means to capture native load impacts (not 
tagged) in load flow models to ensure that parallel flows resulting from 
native load dispatch are accounted for accurately to assess system security.  
This has largely been ignored in the past since most TLRs hit only non-firm 
PTP transactions.  However, the NERC TLR procedures (in line with FERC OATT) 
requires a pro-rata curtailment of native and network service with Firm 
point-to-point (PTP).  Since more and more TLRs at Level 5 (Firm) have been 
utilized and is expected to rise, providers are being forced by the MIC to 
demonstrate comparability at these TLR levels.  In order to demonstrate 
comparability - a transparent calculation of Native and Network impacts is 
needed.  In past, this was left to the discretion of each control area. 

The task force reviewed 7 methods on how to model native gen to native load 
dispatch.  

These seven methods can be grouped into three categories:
1) Continue with the existing method that does not consider counterflows.
2) Inlcude counterflows for NNL (Native/Network Load) and PTP and assign to 
sink control area.
3) Assign NNL counterflows to the control area and PTP counterflows to the 
purchasing selling entitiy (PSE). 

Each method tries to simulate real-time dispatch realizing that an 
interconnection-wide state estimator is not available nor a nodal dispatch 
model.
 
The simplest methods (group 1) adjust each generator individually to a set of 
load points in its control area and repeats until all the units in the 
control area are accounted for.   The problem for the transmission owners 
with this approach is that the netting effects of the real-time dispatch are 
not captured therfore exaggerating the impacts a control area has on its 
neighbors. Group 1 solutions were rejected because the task force beleived 
that its parent, the Security Subcommittee (Dick Ingersoll member) insisted 
on a new procedure that included counterflows - for security reasons.

The initial proposal to include netted effects (Group 2) allows control areas 
to net NNL flows within the control area and PTP to net flows that are 
grouped by sink control area. Group 2 solutions were rejected because PSEs 
would not get credit for off-setting transactions that sink in other control 
areas, e.g. I have a PTP that sinks in TVA that off-sets a PTP that sinks in 
SOCO. Group 2 solutions would not give credit for this.

The most complex method (group 3) allows the native load dispatch to net 
their impacts with all internal gen-load pairings AND nets the contributions 
of point-to-point tagged transactions by PSE.  This is the most equitable 
solution for the market, however it is the most costly and demanding solution 
for the transmission owner/operators. Group 3 solutions were acceptable to 
all parties because it assigned credit to those who are sponsoring 
transactions that relieve the flow gate loading.

Lately, I have been pushed in NERC activities to make calls that boil down to 
what is fair and equitable between native loads and point-to-point service 
vs. what increased burden and accountability on providers is needed to 
provide for that level of comparability.

We should always hold providers to the higher standard.  That is - it is not 
easy to facilitate market transactions, and yes - real people and real 
dollars are needed to be expended by providers to continue facilitating an 
increasingly complex and evolving marketplace.  Providers cannot be let off 
the hook and be allowed to do what is easy and least cost - this has proven 
over and over to have negative impact on the market.

Rick --

You indicated that NERC disavowed their discussions with the press about national security and RTOs to NB (I may have misheard you).  I think these attachments would prove otherwise.  Finally, I'm sure that RJ Rudden is just fronting for Southern.

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters.

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

John - thanks for checking, I have the article in question.

I have been working on some Enron positions on this issue based on that article and some up-front actions Andy and I have encountered at NERC.

Here is an INTERNAL use only document for eveyone's use.
Please contace me if you have any questions,  I will be in the office all next week.

Joe Hartsoe: Please let me know any concerns from the pipeline perspective to ensure that the Enron message is consistent.

This responds to Charles's voice mail and the RTO conference calls that Janel has been on where we have discussed responding to those who say the heightened interest in security is a reason NOT to do large RTOs.  Jim Steffes is the EPSA witness on reliability and other issues at a Barton subcommittee hearing next Wed., Oct. 10th.  While the written testimony filed for the Sept. 11 hearing that was canceled is still operative, Jim's oral remarks can be whatever he wishes.  Also, even if he does not raise it in his opening statement, the issue will no doubt come up by others or in Q&A.

Thus -- any talking points need to be ready by Tuesday for this hearing.  Does not have to be anything fancy or hand-out quality.  Just something for Jim to consider using.  Charles, I do not recall any specific articles on what NERC said, but Sarah Novosel said she would check since she thought there was something like what you raised in your voice mail.

This may be what we need to push the industry over the edge to EISB.  NERC is basically going into a "ignore the market mode" leveraging the threat issue to its fullest.  The fact is, NERC's ability to impact the infrastructure protection is relatively minor.  They mostly deal with communications and data sharing.  The real protection to threats lies in physical security.  We must make clear to the policymakers that NERC and RTOs have little rules and capability to govern physical protection of assets.  These are left in individual asset owners' authority.  Although there is data that can be used negatively, using this data to systematically bring down the grid is not a big bag for the buck that policymakers are concerned about.  Policymakers must not lose perspective that NERC does NOT operate the grid nor is in a position to impose requirements that can protect the infrastructure from physical attack.

Christi,

Is it too obvious that I have little use for NERC?  

NERC's most recent statements really get me upset, if we don't directly confrom them about this, should we work through EPSA?  NERC's position is counter to everything we have been working so hard to move forward...CA and the rest of the western PTOs are bad enough slowling down development efforts without groups like NERC pontificating publically that FERC should slow things down....

Charles --

I would recommend that Jose Bestard be the named person unless there will be 
a number of meetings in the very near term.  It is my understanding that Jose 
will be returning to the US and will take this issue on as the lead no later 
than August 01.  If any of this is incorrect, I should be named.

Finally, does a VP cover the need for "executive"?  Jose and I are both VPs.  
Do we need a higher level - say MD?

other concerned transmission customers to discuss the action items, 
particularly the proposed composition of the Stakeholder Committee.

We also need to be thinking about who from Enron should be the named member.  
The criteria proposed is that he must be executive level and be able to

According to Platt's Electric Power Daily (Fri. Aug. 24), the Administration is "leaning toward" putting the reliability function with FERC and the RTOs, NOT the NERC approach we oppose.  We will check on this independently.  We have certainly encouraged them in the direction they are now leaning toward.

I am pleased to announce that a new feature is being added to the E-Tag 
system: the Potential Adjust List (PAL).

As you may or may not know, there is currently an "Adjust List" that is 
issued when TLRs are called. An "Adjust List" is a recommendation from the 
IDC that describes what transactions should be cut and by how much to achieve 
needed relief to eliminate a constraint.  This Adjust List sent out to 
Generation and Load Control Areas and Tag Authors for all transactions that 
are being recommended for curtailment.  It is intended to aid in coordination 
Control Area schedules during curtailment, as well as alert the marketplace 
of recommendations for their transactions to be curtailed. Under the current 
process, the Adjust List notice is sent out when the initiating Security 
Coordinator and all impacted Security Coordinators have agreed to recommend 
specific curtailments.  As such, this recommendation can occur very late, 
leaving very little time for the market to react (i.e., resource and/or 
resink their power).  

The Potential Adjust List feature adds a second, earlier Adjust List that is 
sent out when the initiating SC requests relief, but prior to the 
confirmation of all the impacting SCs.  This should allow this recommendation 
to be delivered several minutes sooner than it is today, giving more time for 
the market to begin searching for alternate economic sources and sinks.  When 
all impacted SCs confirm, the standard Adjust List recommendation is sent out 
as it is today.

It should be recognized that both the Potential Adjust List and the standard 
Adjust List do not represent actual curtailments - in both cases, they are 
only recommendations for curtailment.  Control Areas may elect to curtail 
different transactions or amounts than reflected in either Adjust List due to 
local relief procedures or other business practices.  However, both lists 
should aid in mitigating risk associated with physical transactions and 
curtailments.  Further, empirical evidence seems to indicate that in the 
majority of cases, the Potential Adjust List, standard Adjust List, and final 
curtailments will be very close.

This change is based a proposal I wrote with the help and support of Jim 
Eckelkamp (Carolina Power and Light), Mark Scheel (Dynegy), and Patt Terris 
(Exelon Power Team).   If you talk to any of them during the course of daily 
business, please thank them for their support of this effort.  With their 
assistance in developing the concept, ironing out the technical details, and 
cultivating NERC support in the various forums,  we were able to implement 
this change very quickly. 

I expect this change to take place sometime between June 15 and June 28.  
Attached, please find a message from NERC that describes the feature and how 
it works.  If you would like more detail, please let me know.  I currently 
Chair the group that is responsible for improving E-Tag, and as such, am 
intimately familiar with tagging and its functions.

In the next few weeks, I will be working with Don Baughman and Juan Hernandez 
to ensure we utilize this feature (and others) to maximize the value of our 
E-Tagging tools.  As indicated above, please feel free to contact me with any 
questions.

I think you also need to consider having someone contact R. J. Rudden about Steve Garwood's statements concerning the large RTOs jeopardizing reliability.  His statement was really amateurish.  Rudden's web page (www.rjrudden.com) <http://www.rjrudden.com)> includes a list of clients, including the following that should be concerned: Calpine, Enron, ISO NE, Midwest ISO, NY ISO, PJM, Southern Energy, and U.S. Gen.  
 
Concerning Christi's question on whether we need a computer group looking at the question of redundancy of systems, I don't think we need it at this point.  It is a given that a complete backup system for all commercial aspects of the systems will be required, along with a handoff protocol for emergency control over all transmission operational aspects of the systems.  The specifics of these need to be decided when the hierarchy of each RTO is determined.

Having watched the whole string of e-mails on this issue, I fully agree with Andy's observations and those of others who have made similar statements. In response to Andy's(and Dave Perrino's) question as to whether we respond to the BS of NERC, absolutely..We should call them on this shameless use of an American tragedy...we should correct them on the facts and use this as an opportunity to highlight their inexcusable and baseless  manipulation of the WTC tragedy. NERC ought to be ashamed of itself.

Christi, 

This is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever heard.  NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning.  They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position.

In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices.  They are in a shopping mall.  How secure is that?  Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open.  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers.  

Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit.  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure.

Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous.  That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail.  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter.   

I echo Dave's question - do we want to "call" NERC on this issue?  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on.  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud.

(By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of "NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards"?  Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle.  Next they'll say that the 60 in "2600" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)

Our NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making statements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comments in these document look more like "this should be reviewed".)

Do we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group perform a study that includes redunancy issues, etc. to counter this?  Certainly, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell's testimony to Congress indicate that they believe that large RTOs will bring more security and reliability (we have included this in our SE RTO mediation comments.)

DATE: September 25, 2001 

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs 

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. 

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

Precisely!  This is the problem throughout the industry right now with these new "independent" Boards being set up by the TOs.  FERC hopefully will address this problem after we are able to file our intervention on DSTAR and expose the behavior of the DSTAR TOs, threatening withdrawal of funding if the Board actually acted independently.

Key must be that whatever organization is setup, it has to have a funding source not controlled by the Industry.

Thanks to Jim and Charles for the reports on the NERC conference call earlier today.  Aside from whatever is done directly with NERC on details of their internal operations to respond to our concerns (i.e., Jeff's presentation to their board and the list of issues Charles had), the NERC/PJM drafting process will continue in DC in coming weeks.  In addition, Congressional staff are likely to be drafting electricity legislation, including a reliability title, during the August Recess that will start at the end of this week (i.e., we will likely be asked to comment on reliability legislation before any meetings with the NERC board are completed).  I will analyze the "shortened NERC" and "PJM Revised" versions and share some thoughts based on our objectives.

Our NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making statements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comments in these document look more like "this should be reviewed".)
Do we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group perform a study that includes redunancy issues, etc. to counter this?  Certainly, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell's testimony to Congress indicate that they believe that large RTOs will bring more security and reliability (we have included this in our SE RTO mediation comments.)

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. 

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

EISB will go forward irregardless of the electric quadrant getting formed.  But the real issue of course is forming this quadrant. 

The EISB  new By-Laws will be publicly available in a couple/few weeks.  It will be able to accomodate ANY type of organization for each of it quadrants.  If the Wholesale Electric Quadrant (WEQ) wants to include both reliability and commercial standards, it may.  If the WEQ wants only to address commerical it may...and every permutation of the two.  So, EISB is flexible enough.  One possibility that has been proposed (and I believe it comes from the NERC staff) is that NERC could be "reliability only" and operate with a Memorandum of Understanding with the EISB WEQ that would be focused on commercial issues.  Not a winner for us - but just to show you how flexible the EISB charter will be.

I will get you more comments on details of EEI language later.

Charles --

Thanks for the reply.  Your thoughts on the EEI draft in terms of details would be helpful.  As I read it, we still have the problems with the EEI draft that we had with the NERC draft on which it is based -- deference, regional rules variances, regional reliability entities, regional advisory boards, limits on FERC authority, etc., etc.  It would also be helpful to have input on whether the plans for EISB could go forward if legislation like the EEI bill were enacted into law.  It would seem not since the "SRO" would focus only on "reliability" as defined by how the bill defines what matters are subjects for an "organization standard."

I guess the point of debate is what is meant by "self-regulating" ?  Can we live with such a name in the language - as long as the language has all the hooks to FERC and other regulators? ( No deference, etc.)  If the language is there that we want - then from the other guys' side, what do THEY see left in the name "self-regulating"?  I think we need to understand this before we can be comfortable with any type of support for "SRO".

Subject:	EPSA/EEI on Reliability


This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability.  Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.

I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC "consensus"), but I think EPSA staff may be "too flexible" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.

It is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can.  I will check with some other EPSA members.

In order to explain who WECC is, I must lay a little historical background.=
  If you will recall, when EPAct'92 was passed, the usual view was that FER=
C could order wheeling, but only on a case by case basis.  There had been a=
n effort to include an RTG provision in the bill, but it died when the conf=
erence committee was finalizing the bill.  There was a view by many in the =
West at the time, that it would still be better to move ahead with self-imp=
lementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation.  In the summ=
er of 1994, first WRTA (Western Regional Transmission Assocation) then SWRT=
A (Southwestern Regional Transmission Association) and NRTA (Northwest Regi=
onal Transmission Association) were filed.  They were developed in an open =
process that included, perhaps for the first time, the transmission owners,=
 the transmission dependent utilities, new market entrants and state regula=
tors.  The IPPs and Marketers were participants, including Enron, Electric =
Clearing House (now Dynegy), DesTec, CalPine, Tenaska, etc.  FERC responded=
 in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmiss=
ion access.  Instead of collapsing as predicted by the "just say no" crowd,=
 the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions.  WRTA f=
ormed in June of 1995. =20
=20
While the RTGs appear rather tame today, at the time they challenged the tr=
aditional view, offering to provide open access tariffs.  When the FERC iss=
ued the NOPR that gave us Orders 888/889 just prior to WRTAs formation, the=
 participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer=
 of 1995 by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OAS=
IS.  With the filing of the current OATTs, much of the ground breaking work=
 of the RTGs was done, but they remained a forum for discussion of the inte=
rface between commercial and reliablity.  A common planning data base was d=
eveloped in which included non-traditional participants and their ideas to =
be included.  The Western Market Interface Committee (WMIC) was organized b=
y the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three (soon to=
 be two?) RTOs proposals together.
=20
When the Western RTGs were organized in 1995 they were formed outside of WS=
CC.  WSCC had a very restrictive policy, allowing only utilities to be memb=
ers.  When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join, it was still by half-measu=
res.  For instance, WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend=
, so new, small members could not employ a consultant for joint representat=
ion.  When the RTG discussions were underway, the good old boys wanted it i=
nside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions.  We broke that mold, formed=
 separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to op=
en its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning orga=
nization.  The change passed by one vote, but the change occured.
=20
Once all the organizations were up and running (WSCC, WRTA, NRTA, SWRTA) it=
 was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functio=
ns.   Serions talks of a merger began in about 1998.  They went very slowly=
, but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Elect=
ric Coordinating Council (WECC), which would merge WSCC, WRTA and SWRTA tog=
ether initially.  NRTA will likely vote to merge as well.  WECC is a RRG as=
 far as NERC is concerned. =20
=20
While the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked, they do furthe=
r open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commer=
cial impact of reliablity rules.  Is this a transitional phase? Perhaps.  D=
oes it go as far as the EISB proposal?  No, but I see no reason to play "sm=
ash-em, bash-em" will every effort that hasn't followed the latest turn in =
our thinking.  As I hope this memo shows, we have been evolving the industr=
y, never as fast as Enron or others (myself included) have wanted it to cha=
nge.  The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules =
and opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to=
 breath some life into the organization.  At a minimum, the change from WSC=
C/WRTA/SWRTA/NRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate=
 over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place.

This is the first I have heard of WECC.  I assume it is a "Western" NERC -t=
ype organization?=20

 I understand that the traders in the West are not too concerned about form=
ing single standards applicable to both the East and West.  They would howe=
ver, like to see more consistency in practices between TPs within the West =
itself.  Sounds like WECC may be able to do this. One of the big problems w=
ith the WSCC has been that it was not as stringent in dictating operating r=
equirements on its members as the East has tried to be.   At NERC, WSCC mem=
bers have always argued deference to the West due to system differences.  U=
nfortunately deference to the West has meant little to no standardization i=
n the West over many transmission access practices, leaving it up to the su=
b-regions or individual TPs to decide.  I am not saying they are not techni=
cally justified, but there has been no incentive to bring about more consis=
tent practices.

Is WECC consistent with EISB?  It depends, if WECC is sovereign over any ot=
her organization for standards approval, then I would say no.  I think WECC=
 should be subject to the EISB process and have to get standards approved t=
hrough EISB as well.  The problem is that EISB is voluntary and if WECC can=
 go directly to FERC, then it becomes effectively the same as "deference to=
 the West" -type language we have been fighting against. =20

So my verdict on WECC depends.....=20
As I noted in an earlier note, I believe there are those pushing for NERC t=
o continue doing "reliability-only" and establish a contractual relationshi=
p to coordinate with EISB.  The WECC could take the same approach.  If this=
 scenario plays out, I believe customers will leave NERC and put their mone=
y into EISB.  We must then work towards making NERC merely a transmission o=
perators' advocacy group ( i.e. EEI is transmission owners advocacy group).=
  They can exist to focus on reliability - but have no direct standards set=
ting authority.  They must be a member of EISB and participate as a member =
in one of the market sectors.

If anyone has any more info on WECC, please share it.=20

The thing that stands out to me at this point Charles is the one hour time limit for reporting the occurrence by the Control Area Operator, ISO, RTO or Security Coordinators. The Proposed EIA-417 has sanctions that will be imposed on the parties for failure to respond according to their requirements. The proposed reporting group has not to this point been responsible for reporting requirements and this would throw them into the deep end of the pool. Another option that is out there at this time is through the Critical Infrastructure Protection Working Group.

Participation in this program is on a voluntary basis. A few companies have signed on with the program but that will probably increase now. Wally Johnson is the lead on this effort and he requested earlier in the year to address System operators at annual meetings to increase the awareness and hopefully participation in the program. They also have a one hour time frame for reporting contingencies.One method used for reporting is the SCIS and then handled by the Security Coordinators. No sanctions imposed, they just want the information to be shared in order to track the problem and see if a pattern exist.

Charles it looks like both of the above groups are moving towards the same goal but have not meet in the middle to discuss this.

NERC has had a twenty-four hour standard for disturbances but something else is needed because it is not effective. 
In summary I would support the work of the Critical Infrastructure group as they stand now. 
Any questions or concerns please let me know.

Subject: FW: Federal Register notices - 417R Changes 


The DOE is requesting comments from industry regarding proposed changes to an EIA form EIA-417R for reporting "Electric Power System Emergency Report".  This is being revised to become EIA-417 "Electric Emergency Incident and Disturbance Report".  Reporting will be reduced from the existing >3300 entities to approximately 200 control area operators, RTOS, and Security Coordinators.   

However, "Any utility, businesss entity, or energy concern that participates in the electric power industry could be notified by DOE that it needs to provide technical information concerning a particular incident."

There are a series of questions in the notice (attached) directed towards those responsible for providing responses to the form and those utilizing the data.

NERC is developing a response to these forms and I anticipate that many of their utility members will point out that the traders and IPPs need to be included due to the interdependency on the market/trading systems for energy supply.

For the control area data, I ask that Keith and Lloyd review the new form since we are still operating a control area. 

I will track the NERC comments - and if need be, may ask Dan Watkiss to draft comments to DOE to protect our interests.

Subject:	RE: Bingaman reliability draft language


It is important to point out that under the Bingaman reliability language, FERC has total discretion as to whether to adopt a NERC standard.  Charles does make a good point about the deference language.  As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance.  At a minimum, that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB.  Similarly, the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC.

I understand that the NERC needs to be recognized for political reasons - but this shuts out the possibility of a EISB.  Since it recognizes RTOs, it should alos leave open the possibility of yet another entity to perform the reliability standards setting function,  at least allow for the RTOs to work through a central standards setting organization other than NERC.

Christi,

The NERC statements clearly seem to indicate they feel threatened by the RTO formation process and EISB.

Frankly, nothing stated anywhere in the attachments hasn't already been thought out and handled by the three ISOs in the East and the CAISO as well.  All four of these entities have fully functional back-up facilities in other parts of their regions and NERC is fully aware of them.  I would assume ERCOT also has a fully functional, redundant control scheme in place as well.

In the case of NY there is another site physically apart from the main control center which has a fully redundant computer and communications system.  They have (or used to have) plans which in the event neither center is available, can revert control back to the TOs (heaven forbid)  until ISO personnel can resume control of the grid.  So they have 3 sets of redundancy, in addition to radio and satellite communications if necessary.

Earlier RTO West discussions all contained similar concerns and plans for redundancy and the DSTAR preliminary design documents also plan on redundancy.  NERCs assertion that they would "slow-down" the RTO formation process is absurd (geez, it's going too slow now!!!). 

Running distributed, synchronized computer networks is not rocket science...how do the folks at NERC explain the NYSE quick recovery from a ground zero attack?  There was no report of crippling loss of financial information...at least that I am aware of.  Even a small operation like APX operates their systems using distributed computing and synchronized data.

For NERC to use the NIMDA virus as a specific attack on the electrical grid operation and the compromising of reliability is preposterous and the resulting "service denials" cited are probably refusal(s) of tags, which from what I understand, the utilities probably cause much more self-inflicted havoc than this virus!

The press release you refer to just confirms NERC's position of maintaining status quo.  Should we "call" NERC on these statements?  The remarks made in these public statements seem irresponsible.

Kind Regards,

Dave

Our NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making statements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comments in these document look more like "this should be reviewed".)
Do we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group perform a study that includes redunancy issues, etc. to counter this?  Certainly, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell's testimony to Congress indicate that they believe that large RTOs will bring more security and reliability (we have included this in our SE RTO mediation comments.)

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. 

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

Jim and Rick

Please read Mike Gildea's issue 2. I work with Mike closely on operating 
policy issues.  He is with Duke NA, the IPP side, formerly with EEI.  I need 
some help on where Enron stands on current legislation as it relates to his 
question.

Do we think the language empowers NERC with too much authority?  Or does it 
allow for any organization, i.e. GISB/EISB to perform the functions.

I know Enron agrees with NERC not imposing restrictions on the RTOs and slow 
down market formation - but we certainly don't want to have to deal with 
every RTO as a reliability standard setting organization.

at the moment.    Optimally, we need the three of us on the same page when
we go to the TCCG meeting in Tampa,  from there we can try to spread our
common message.

2. On another front, - the reliability legislation.  I told our DC office
(not that they will listen) that the legisation NERC is pushing on the
Capitol Hill is now outdated and puts too much emphasis for standards in
NERC hands when the game today is inthe RTOs.  A powerful NERC may slow up
market development.   What is the view of Enron here?  I assume the same,
but curious.  Apparently, some Hill Staffers called our DC office for
opinions on the NERC reliability legislation - so something afoot.

Subject:  Re: when the LCA is not the Sink



Charles and Mike - At yesterday's Security Subcommittee meeting, a motion
passed to change SMEPA control area configuration in the IDC to reflect the
location of their share of generation in Entergy's territory that is needed
to serve their load.  The way the IDC was working was giving erroneous
information about an overload on the Weber-Richard line, which in fact was
not happening.  I tried to prevent this change for occurring stating that
policy 9 allows for the security coordinators to adjust the cut list when
known errors are occurring.

We need to have a definite action plan for how and when increased
granularity will be allowed to happen.  Lanny Nickell is suppose to make a
presentation at the next MIC meeting about this.  But we all need to be on
the same page to have an action plan in place that we can start shopping to
MIC members. I have volunteered to head a group to try to define the "end
state" of total granularity that we would ultimately want for the IDC and
the asociated costs to get there.

Another important issue that we need to address head on is the desire of
the SCs to allow for lowering of the impact thresholds for certain
flowgates that are now not getting relief at 5%.  I asked if this motion
was passed would it guarantee that less MW's will be cut in order to get
the relief needed -- the answer was no. Therefore, why should we support
any change?  This entire issue centers around a fundamental issue that has
existed from day one when flowgates were first allowed -- what are the
standards for allowing new flowgates?  To what extent should local problems
be addressed by the transmission provider with those problems, versus
putting the pain on the entire market place because the TP can't or won't
improve their transmission facility?  (In the first days of TLR, I raised
this issue over and over again when MAIN used a 500 kV line as a proxy for
the Albion Transformer -- which caused about 2,500 source-sink pairs to be
cut throughout the eastern interconnection).  This is an issue that
ultimately will be handled by the RTOs, but education is the key here as
flowgates are being defined around the country.


Another issue is OSL determination.  Ben Li has prepared Appendix 9C1A.
There was discussion at the meeting that implementing this would further
restrict transmission access.  The SCs are all over the board on this.  I
reminded them that the MIC had asked for data for each flowgate now in
existence for TLR purposes to define for us how they determine their own
limits -- I was told at this meeting  it was never done because there was
no agreement on how to measure the OSL.  So how, I asked, can a OSL be
determined via of a NERC standard?

I have real heartburn that NERC does not have any measurable standards for
allowing the items discussed above.  We have to force criteria and
measurable standards.

Let me know what you think.  Also, what we need to do to flesh out these
issues so everyone can understand them.

Charles, I agree with you buti think we need to resist increased
granularity at this time. ?It will only decrease transmission and increase
TLR,s. ?Also the increase in transmission segments will make it more
dificult to put a transaction together.

This sounds like a tagging problem and not an IDC granularity problem.
Yes - this can be fixed with a IDC granularity change but does NERC want to
change IDC granualaruty on a piecemeal basis for this and the othe 14
control areas? ?What abot when these 15 control areas change to another
control area service provider? ?What about the next 15?

I don't think that AEP's customers actually disconnected from the AEP grid
and reconnected at some other point in another control area's transmission
network. The IDC is not mapping flows for that customer any more "wrongly"
than when that customer purchased control area services from AEP.

This is why hard criteria is needed to verify whether these 15 situations
require granularity change or whether ALL existing control areas need more
granularity for that matter.

We have been informed by one of our customers who serves a load which has
been electronically removed from the AEP Control Area that ?from now on
they will use the Electronic Control Area as the LCA, instead of using the
Physical Control Area (AEP) as the LCA. In this way, the Electronic Control
Area will be properly notified of any adjustments and approvals regarding
this transaction. Unfortunately, the IDC will be mapping the flow into one
CA while it's really going to another.

Our representative to the SSC will be arguing strenuously at their next
meeting that these types of situations need to be addressed. Historically,
the creation of a new control area has been the answer. Lou has indicated
that there are 14 of these situations pending in the Eastern Interconnect.

        When appropriate, GISB should do some kind of press release and congressional outreach so that policymakers are aware
        of this significant development.  We have made reference to the process of turning GISB into EISB as we have discussed
        the reliability issue, but the board vote is another reason for them to do some outreach on their own as well.

Subject: GISB Approves Strawman 2.1


Yesterday, Spet 19, the GISB Board of Directors voted unanimously to recharter GISB into the EISB as proposed in the Strawman Ver 2.1.  This will form the four quadrant standards setting organization.  It was recognized that each of the four quadrants would devlop on their own pace and lack of formation of any one quadrant would not inhibit the formation of EISB itself.
 
The GISB Board also recognized a comment from PJM who asked to strike out language in the Strawman 2.1 that referenced NERC and AGA as two physical reliability standards organizations.  Many electric wholesale customer, including EPSA and Enron, have argued that reliability and commercial issues are inseparable and believe there should not be artificial limits to what the wholesale electric quadrant should be able to address.  The GISB Board recognized this concern, but rather than strike the language, it was recognized that the words were only in a preamble and instructed the drafting of the new charter to not include such language.

To follow-up with some other thoughts --

1.	We focused the discussions on the lack of action by the NAERO board.  I mentioned the lack of action on Independence of Security Coordinators.  Anderson responded by indicating that they weren't ready to go there because weren't quite sure if they could get the industry to agree - made our point.  Also, pointed out that the old agreement was only if comprehensive legislation is passed.

2.	Rick used the analogy that NAERO has done nothing to earn our deference to their legislation.  Jeff used the FASB - SEC model as an example of what a good relationship could look like.  Why should we support anointing NERC to the post while they have done nothing to "earn our respect".

3.	Dave Cook discussed the problems with PJM - (1) canada involvement, (2) FERC didn't have technical staff.  I don't think that the Canada problem was too great.  The other issue seems to play right into the point - there will be alot of deference to a group on technical matters but getting the independence right is important.

4.	While Jeff indicated that PJM is better, Rick highlighted that we weren't agreeing to that either.  Still problems (such as funding).

5.	I still don't like the term SRO - selfregulating standards organiation.  Should just be a standards organization.  

Anderson is calling Rick to set up a meeting between Jeff and the NAERO board.

Jim

Subject:	Update - Jeff Skilling Conference Call with John Q Anderson

Thursday morning, August 2nd, Jeff Skilling held a conference call with John Q Anderson, one of 9 independent Board members of NERC, to discuss Enron's position on the NERC version of reliability legislation.  Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes were present on the call.

John Anderson's purpose for the call with Jeff was to find out what Enron wanted to see in legislation in order for Enron to give deference to NERC to become a Self-Regulated Organization for setting reliability standards.

Jeff explained that the PJM version has a more likeable approach than the NERC version, PJM's is less prescriptive and relies more on FERC participation in establishing a "SRO".  Additionally, funding concerns are not addressed in either version and a viable funding mechanism that does not rely on Regional Councils is needed.

Jeff also would like to make a presentation (as soon as possible) to the NERC Board of Trustees of the key items Enron would like to see resolved that would provide Enron enough confidence that the NERC/NAERO organization would be independent enough from the stakeholders and be willing enough to tackle the industry's toughest issues concerning competitive markets in electricity.  

I will be working with the Enron-NERC team on a breifing paper of what we want NERC to fix in current NERC rules and processes for NERC to demonstrate it is worthy of the "SRO" status.  Some example issues include:
1) Indpendence requirements for operators and Security Coordinators
2) competitive advantages of control areas - parking and hubbing
3) competitive advantages of native and network service - source and sink data requirements

On Wed, I met at EPSA to discuss with members - the near term future 
participation of EPSA staff and members at NERC.

A roster of participants follows this brief summary.

Most members agreed in concept that NERC must continue to be monitored at 
least in the near term because of their "monopoly" on the 
reliability/commercial rules.  There was agreement that NERC had moved into 
the commercial/non-reliability standards setting partly becuase the 
incumbants desgined it that way and partly due to a lack of another industry 
representative forum  for FERC to delegate to.  Some members were encouraged 
that GISB was interested in becoming an alternative forum (EISB) and pointed 
to GISB successes in creating an efficient Bulletin Board for Gas in response 
to FERC orders.  The members also realized that most of the NERC problems are 
caused by the native load exception which the gas industry did not have to 
deal with making their restructuring easier.

EPSA staff will focus on representing EPSA members' viewpoints to the 
independent board members to establish working relationships and to provide 
market perspectives as well as governance problems within the NERC 
structure.  

Many EPSA members also felt that EPSA staff could do more to provide 
information regarding NERC issues that affect the markets so that a greater 
number of members can convey their positions to the NERC Committee and 
Subcommittee market representatives. Some possible email/members only 
bulletin board was discussed.

Reliant (John Orr) also expressed concern over continuing to allow NERC (as 
opposed to the RTOs)  to set the commercial standards.  Most agreed that NERC 
does not design efficient commercial/market standards and should leave the 
non-reliablity rules to RTOs.  Others (myself, DENA, Ontario Power Gen) who 
participate on NERC groups agreed to this in concept but raised the problem 
that many of the reliability rules overlap commercial rules with no "bright 
line" between the two.

Please contact me if you wish more details of the meeting.

It is important to point out that under the Bingaman reliability language, FERC has total discretion as to whether to adopt a NERC standard.  Charles does make a good point about the deference language.  As written, FERC has discretion to defer to NERC or an RTO to monitor and enforce compliance.  At a minimum, that language should be expanded to include another entity like an EISB.  Similarly, the language should probably be tweaked to allow FERC to adopt standards of an organization other than NERC.

Subject:	RE: Bingaman reliability draft language

I understand that the NERC needs to be recognized for political reasons - but this shuts out the possibility of a EISB.  Since it recognizes RTOs, it should alos leave open the possibility of yet another entity to perform the reliability standards setting function,  at least allow for the RTOs to work through a central standards setting organization other than NERC.

John

Overall, this is still too detailed than what we would like.  But if we want to provide feedback to EEI, here are some key items.

"(D) assures that no two industry sectors have the ability to control, and no one industry sector has the ability to veto, the electric reliability organization's discharge of its responsibilities;

This is problematic, the GISB process works because it allows exactly that any one sector can stop the progress.  This provides a huge incentive for all to work towards agreement from the beginning and minimizes the use of hidden agendas.


"(G) establishes fair and impartial procedures for enforcement of organization standards, either directly or through delegation to an affiliated regional reliability entity, including the imposition of penalties; limitations on activities, functions, or operations; or other appropriate sanctions;

BUT:

"(B) permits voluntary membership to any user of the bulk-power system, state representative, consumer representative or public interest group;
How can they be voluntary and have enforcement?

"(3) The Commission shall give due weight to the technical expertise of the electric reliability organization with respect to the technical content of a new or modified organization standard.  The Commission shall not defer to the organization with respect to the competitive implications of implementing the standard or the effect of the standard on competition.

This appears better than the NERC langauge but still assumes the ability to look at 2 separate types of standards - technical reliability and commercial business. 
Why not focus on what the Commission shall do - and not what they should not do?  "The Commission shall consider and give appropriate weighting to both technical and commercial impacts in organization standards."
 
"(g)	ORGANIZATION MEMBERSHIP- Every system operator shall be required to be a member of the electric reliability organization and any affiliated regional reliability entity or entities in whose geographic area it operates or is responsible for operating bulk-power system facilities.

Such language has the potential to tie the hands of an organization to become heavily weighted with utility types.  (g) should recognize that RTOs will consolidate much of the individual control area operators need for representation.  Remember, the asset owners, different from the operators, will want to be members too.  Also, it must ensure that the funding mechanism will not influence the membership make-up such that it memberhip becomes un-balanced.  But the real key is fixing "D" - any sector should be able to stop progress.

Subject:	EPSA/EEI on Reliability


This follows up on Rick's inquiry late last week on the talks between EPSA and EEI on reliability.  Yesterday I spoke with Mark Bennett and Donn Salvosa of the EPSA staff.  Mark did the talking.  The upshot is that EPSA and EEI are meeting to see if they can't agree on reliability legislation.  EEI is working off of the NERC draft and has sent a version to EPSA dated 9/14 (see attached) that was the basis for last Thursday's meeting.  EPSA is now doing some drafting of its own.

I need to read the 9/14 draft, but the fact that they are working off of the old NERC language is of considerable concern.  EPSA staff emphasizes the value of having EEI off the NERC reservation (which is good in terms of showing that there is NERC "consensus"), but I think EPSA staff may be "too flexible" in how they are approaching it.  I reminded them of our position and concerns and of Jim's prepared statement on EPSA's behalf filed for the Sept. 11 Barton hearing.  EPSA staff claims that other EPSA members are OK with them embarking on this project.

It is not clear if this effort will succeed.  EPSA staff said EEI's board insists on having engineers do reliability, which is objectionable to EPSA.  EPSA staff seems to think that some type of reliablity SRO is inevitable and that it is wise to get the best one they can.  I will check with some other EPSA members.

I think that this is a good step but we need to remember that NERC in the commercial sector may not prove to be the end all.  Also, while RTOs may enforce the standards or set the standards, not sure if we want one organization doing both.

Subject:	RE: NERC Board Actions

This is a direct result of the recent actions from GISB to get involved in the wholesale electric standards.   We and EPSA have made positive statements about the GISB process.  NERC has been forced to change to accomodate what many in the industry are looking for.  There are still many "ifs" at GISB at this time, much of it around how much the big utilitites would be willing to support it.  Our position has been - whoever provided the best deal first, that is where the industry will take its business.

Kevin's preferences for RTO standards is not out of the question.   FERC will utlimately decide how much standards setting authority the RTOs will have.   NERC will certainly foucs - at least - on inter-RTO standards, something RTOs will not do well, if at all.  Howvever, NERC must not impede on internal RTO market structures and rules - a "commercial standard"  - this is why NERC recognizing commercial interests is such a big step.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.

Thanks to Jim and Charles for the reports on the NERC conference call earlier today.  Aside from whatever is done directly with NERC on details of their internal operations to respond to our concerns (i.e., Jeff's presentation to their board and the list of issues Charles had), the NERC/PJM drafting process will continue in DC in coming weeks.  In addition, Congressional staff are likely to be drafting electricity legislation, including a reliability title, during the August Recess that will start at the end of this week (i.e., we will likely be asked to comment on reliability legislation before any meetings with the NERC board are completed).  I will analyze the "shortened NERC" and "PJM Revised" versions and share some thoughts based on our objectives.

I don't know that NERC has "given up" on Enron.  The timing of next week's meeting to "resolve" the legislation  reflects the legislative realities that the committees of jurisdiction in Congress will take up the realibility legislation, along with other electricity issues, as early as the second week of September.  In fact, congressional staff in the Senate and House are drafting legislative language on electricity issues during the August recess.  They have pressed the "coalition" for a final work product.

I gathered that at least some of what Jeff'spresentation to the NERC board would be about concerns matters beyond the legislation as such, but since they go to the NERC board's operation and independence, may go to our comfort level with NERC as the standards setting organization.

Given the issues and concerns that have been addressed and communicated to NERC, and our preference for the PJM model (as Jeff told John Q. Anderson in the conference call), I think NERC got the information it wanted to get out of the call even though it didn't like the answers: i.e., whether Sarah and I have been faithfully representing Enron's position, whether Enron supports an "SRO" type organization; and whether there is anything they can do to get us on board.

Perhaps we should have another conference call early next week so that Sarah and I have our guidance from everyone going into the August 9th meeting.  For one thing, we need to determine if we are in any position to provide detailed comments on the "shortened NERC" version at the August 9th meeting or whether we do not wish to engage them on what specific changes it would take to get us on board.

My sense is that since we have to deal with the players in the room on other issues, our overall position will be strengthened if we have some specific comments to make to explain our decision not to support NERC's version, even the shortened one.  Don't get me wrong -- we have plenty of good reasons not to, I just wasn't sure how "engaged" we wanted to be in identifying changes that would bring us on board since I gather our opposition is more fundamental (no Western deference, budget concerns, independence issues, etc.).

John

We are concerned how this meeting impacts what transpired between John Q Anderson and Jeff Skilling on the conference call on Thursday.

David Cook was on the call as well and we do not understand the sudden urgency for NERC to reach closure.  Has NERC given up on Enron?

As we understand it, John Q Anderson agreed to give Jeff an opportunity to present present before the NERC Board some ke y issues for Enron before trying to finalize any NERC legislation proposal.   Does this meeting next week preclude that presentation from occurring?  Or will there be willingness to alter the language significantly enough to appease the Enron concerns next week?

See NERC memo below that was just received.  They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to "resolve" the reliability legislation next week -- August 9th.  Of course, this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model (even the shortened one), and not the PJM model that others prefer to use.  We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version, even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting, or simply "agree to disagree."

Subject:	revisions to reliability language


Reliability legislation coalition

I have attached a memo outlining the edits that NERC would make in the
7/19 discussion draft.  My memo does not take account of the suggestions
that have been circulated in the last day or so.  I've also attached a
marked-up version of the 7/19 draft indicating our changes.

I propose that we meet in Washington on Thursday, August 9, at 10:00
a.m., with the goal of coming to closure on reliability legislation that
is shorter and less detailed than the language in the pending bills, but
that still preserves the essence of an industry self-regulatory
organization.  I am working on a location and expect to provide that
information tomorrow.

I know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and that
schedules are already full, but schedules will become even more
difficult later in the month.  I take as our deadline having new
language for the Hill during the August recess.

Thank you in advance for your continuing efforts to bring this new model
for reliability into existence.

Charles,

Some comments.  I removed some words I though made NERC look too respectable/official, embellished some of your points, added a section on RTO security risk, and added some stronger "chastisement" words at the end.  They may be too strong, but I think the paper needs to be assertive.  Out of curiosity, is there an intended audience?  If it is NERC, maybe the more passive approach is preferable, but if it is anyone else, then maybe the aggressiveness would be a good thing. I think we want to make sure the audience finishes by looking at NERC and shaking their head in disgust, rather than sighing and shrugging their shoulders.  Of course, that could backfire and make us look like we're unfairly attacking NERC without any provocation, especially given the esoteric nature of some of our points.

Thoughts?

Subject:	Draft revisions to the 9/6/01 Bingaman reliability provision

Enclosed is my draft of possible revisions to the above-referenced reliability provision, taking into
account suggestions by Craig. I have enclosed a redline version and a clean one. The revision does
the following:
1.By adding"without hindering reliable, non-discriminatory, and efficiently priced transmission service"
it uses words of art from FERC Order No. 2000 and shows the intertwined nature of security and commercial practices.
2.By adding the reference to section 201(f), it specifically includes  Federal and State entities.
3.There is no named reference for any particular industry  standards body---thus no attempt to either
provide an advantage or disadvantage to any existing body.
4.The FERC could take into consideration recommendations of enties with technical expertise regarding reliability standards---such as WECC , Regional Advisory Bodies, and the States.
5. FERC could assign enforcement responsibility in a given area to any appropriate entity---such as WECC or RTOs.
6.It puts in a definition of reliability standards that is limited to security and, by not including adequacy, is
not as intrusive on prerogatives of States.
7.I bracketed the possibility of a States savings provision for further consideration. Of course, the
narrower the scope---i.e. no consideration of generation adequacy---the less need there is for such
a provision.
Please give me any feedback.
Bobby

Subject:	Update - NERC Version of Legislation

Rick

The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NERC activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly ENRON-NERC team conference call.

John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length of its proposed "Title on Reliability" so as to look more like the PJM approach.  Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the "SRO" in the legislation.  

Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook and Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NERC stakeholders to "finalize" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organization - SSO).

The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to present issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discussions with NERC, John Shelk plans to "stay the line" on the Enron position of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that defers to the SSO out of the legislation.  

Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not through legislation, rather through FERC "comfort" that the SSO is doing a good job.  By knowing that FERC can "pull the plug" on the SSO if it is not satisfied, this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no industry segment dominates the standards setting process.

I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to resolve/address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of why NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules that all its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be powerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authority in the legislation.  

We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation principles with Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.

Charles, Jose, Jim, and Rick, 

I would like to send the letter below out to the ESC.  Before I do so, do you have any objections?  I would like to put some fire under this issue, as the "new sector weighted voting model" seems to be yet another way to preserve the power of the traditional utility.  However, I don't know if we will compromise any of our other positions by stirring this particular pot.  Thoughts?

Andy



Gordon,

When did the ESC vote to adopt the  "new sector weighted voting model?"  Has the ESC been absorbed into NERC, and is the NERC Board ordering them to use this new model?  If so, is the ESC a new standing committee?  Do they report directly to the board? Just where would the ESC fit in NERC?

Unless the ESC votes to change their charter to say they are a group under NERCs control, I don't see how this can move forward as written.  The ESC has never been a NERC group, but instead a industry collaborative which NERC has assisted with administrative matters (facilitation, meeting schedules, etc...).  If I recall correctly, there was a significant number of people that specifically did not _want_ the ESC to be a NERC group, (APPA, ELCON, EPSA, and a few others, if I remember correctly).  This was why the NERC ESTF became the non-NERC ESC.  I expect several entities will have comments to make before just handing the keys to NERC.  

Of course, those comments may have already been made at the Board, and may have been addressed there.  But I seriously don't think NERC can just "annex" the ESC without the ESC voting to be annexed.  

Other members of the ESC - do you share this concern?

This document, although lengthy, contains insight to what NERC's BOT may be asked to endorse as far as establishment of a NERC position on reliabilty standards and market practices.  It also has implications on how to split the baby between NERC and GISB.

I suggest all to review this draft and be ready to provide the MIC feedback when it appears on their agenda.  I am unsure if it will show up in the July meeting, perhaps Terry Lane of Dynegy, who is on the subcommittee that put this together can provide us with more info.

Mark, please forward this to the EPSA-NAERO group list.

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. 

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

All comments were that more transmission capacity was needed.  AEP noted that flow on some bulk transmission paths is up 500% to 1000% over what it was in the old days.  Nothing specific was discussed about how to address this other than to have early and comprehensive coordination among interested parties so that investments could be made.

There was also some concern about new generation interconnection and how those costs should be covered.  AEP did not like the current system where they conclude that the system pays all costs of interconnection when generators receive all of the benefit.  It was questioned whether or not the system didn't receive a benefit as well, but AEP countered that the current approach does not give any incentive to generation to locate appropriately and that in the end, benefits go to the generator out of proportion to the cost imposed on them.

It will be interesting to see if Walter et al. encounter the same issues or completely different ones.

Charles,

Thanks for the comments.  I attended the first workshop in Detroit this Monday, primarily to observe what people were saying.  For those who are interested, I summarize below.

While this workshop was done via video conference, the remaining workshops will be face-to-face affair.  Peter Dreyfuss, director of the Chicago regional office of the DOE, hosted speakers from the Michigan Public Service Commission (Chairman Chapelle) and the Ohio PUC.  Non-speakers in attendance were from DTE Energy, EPRI, and the USDA.  Via video conference were DOE participants/consultants from DC, ORNL, LBL, and the University of Illinois, as well as speakers from National Grid and AEP.  Transcripts/testimony should be available on the NTGS website by next week.

Most of the discussion I heard focused on permitting.  There was general reluctance to have federal intervention.  The Ohio PUC promoted their legislation which coordinates the various overlapping jurisdictions and empowers bodies to hold hearings, etc with regulators from other states.  AEP suggested federal involvement after a 6 or 12 month time trigger has passed.  Some questions addressed incentives for expansion and development of merchant transmission, but most answers were general and vague.  AEP declined to provide specifics, but promised to address the topic in their written comments.  There was also some talk about the interaction between generation and transmission, but the answers were also rather vague.

I want to raise awareness to the Enron persons who plan to attend the upcoming DOE meetings regarding one of the less technical issues on the agenda.  I have pasted the reference from the issues summary that references NERC that I am concerned with . I personally am unable to attend any of the workshops due to meeting conflicts - but wish those who will attend to be aware of Enron's position about NERC as a reliability standards setting organization. 
(Richard Ingesrsoll, I believe we have enough coverage and you need not attend, thank you)
EXCERPT FROM THE DOE WEBSITE:
Reliability Management and Oversight
Institutional structures for assuring reliability. The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) is evolving from a bottom-up, industry-dominated, volunteer organization into the North American Electric Reliability Organization (NAERO), which may be overseen by an independent board. NAERO proposes to set and enforces mandatory standards and have regional reliability councils report to it (rather than vice versa). Some suggest that reliability administration should be vested in NAERO. Others advocate for regional reliability authorities that are free to establish standards that focus on regional conditions. The requirements of reliability management and oversight must be delineated in order to assess the extent to which alternative institutional structures can meet these requirements Return to the National Transmission Grid Study website </ntgs/> 
Summary of Enron Concerns with NERC/NAERO
NERC is being challenged by many transmission customers as to its capability to continue be the indsutry's reliability standards setting organization.  Enron, as do many other customers, believes that any standards setting organization must recognize the commercial impacts of a reliability standard.  The definition of "reliability" is inextricably tied to commercial impacts in some form.  For example, even a standard for system frequency at 60 Hz contains economic factors when an operator establishes a procedure to maintain frequency in the name of reliability. 
Therefore, Enron does not support NERC proceeding as a "reliabilty only" organization.  Enron has been supportive of the GISB efforts to establish an Energy Industry Standards Board that will contain no artificial boundaries of commercial or reliability as to its scope of standards regarding the wholesale electric quadrant.  In short - Enron should make clear that the existing NERC and NAERO organziation and its approach to setting reliabilty standards ignores the market/commercial impacts - relegating the market concerns as second class citizens in their process.  
Please forward this to any other Enron persons who plan to attend these workshops and contact me if you have any questions.
Thank You

I have been making statements about this concern through emails and some meetings - with little impact.  These decisions are made solely between NERC stffers and the Regional Councils. They are not getting to where we can vote on it. We need a stronger voice to get this in front of the MIC and OC. I will try to rally EPSA members behind this issue.

NERC is apparently moving forward aggressively on their initiative to restrict access to market information.  Doug Sewell, who participates on the MAIN Planning Committee, was on a call this morning in which members of MAIN and NERC's Virginia Sulzberger discussed ways to limit access to information.  A new disturbing angle was that apparently, some members indirectly alleged that marketers have "higher turnover" and "loose lips," and were using this as a scare tactic to indicate why the information should be restricted (potentially even from legitimate consumers like us).

If I remember correctly, we were going to contact NERC to let them know our opinions on this issue.  It sounds like perhaps they are not being addressed sufficiently.  Doug has suggested we should being it up at the MAIN MIC meeting; do we want to begin a campaign to protect our access to this data?  I think that without getting more involved, this will be yet another industry "de facto" standard that is created under the assumption that silence is consent (even if we're not told about the changes).  We should probably talk about this all today on our conference call.

Charles...I am sorry I was not able to respond to your e-mail prior to the
this.  I was in airports for 13 hours on Friday ( because of airline delays)
and this is the first chance I had to read your E-mail.  I have one
correction.  Steve Hawke to the best of my knowledge has not agreed to this
change yet.  What I informed you in Tampa was my preference that "if it came
down to the choice for one of us to step down "  I will be ready to so
considering that ENRON has nation wide issues that it is dealing with in this
Forum.  However, I needed to clear this with Steve Hawke since he has the
ultimate decision on this and he may have different views.  You were going to
request that James or Richard get in contact with Steve to resolve the
representation question.  I informed you that Steve will be out of the office
through the 14th and that he will be back on the 15th and that hope was that
some communication will take place then to discuss the issue.  Unless there
has been some form communication between the ENRON folks and Steve since the
last MIC meeting that I am not aware of, it is important that we follow the
discussion that we had in Tampa.  I look forward to the results of the
discussion between Steve and either Rick or James.

>>> Yeung, Charles 05/11/01 06:20AM >>> 
I have referred Steve Hawke from Portland General to you and Jim concerning a
conflict of representation at the NERC Market Interface Committee. 

The current NERC rules on committee membership disallows one corporate entity
from populating a single committee with more than one member. I have one seat
of 33 on the MIC (1 of 2 power marketer seats) and Frank Afranji from PGE has
a WSCC representative seat. This conflict was known but accepted in the recent
past because of the publicly known fact surrounding the sale of PGE. In
addition, it is generally understood that PGE's positions at the MIC are not
closely aligned with EPMI's. Frank also must vote as a WSCC rep, not a PGE
rep. Nontheless, wiith the recent news of the demise of the PGE sale, the
Enron dual membership conflict on the MIC is being forced to be resolved. 

Steve Hawke has agreed to pull his PGE person off the committee - but wanted
Enron to raise a need to revise these rules for the future so that Frank could
possibly be reappointed. 

Paul Barber, Chair of the MIC believes this membership rule needs to be
updated because of the dynamic nature of corporate affiliations today - this
has recently prevented good, knowledgable persons from participating on a NERC
committee (e.g.- Illinova/Dynegy, PECO/ComEd) 

I agree with the need to revisit this rule - but believe there still is a need
to limit corporate representation on NERC committees due to the structure and
approval processes NERC employs - there are limited seats, The one member
limit was intended to curb large incumbant utilities from dominating the
committees since they had such extensive business interests and could be
over-represented under several industry segments.

After reading the FTC document, I am concerned that we are loosing sight of=
 the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser=
vice.  It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedu=
les will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by it=
s performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard=
 against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit =
ISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim=
ize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require =
the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) =
The opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cove=
r their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely. =20

If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rule=
s would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the vali=
dity of the "reliability provisions" of the tariffs the FERC will be requir=
ed to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have th=
e expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and=
 is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting=
 Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of th=
e industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to=
 complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally c=
oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the=
 service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in=
 most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce th=
e rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National=
 Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accompl=
ished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, et=
c.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in=
corporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff woul=
d incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rule=
s or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action =
can be taken to enforce.

My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m=
ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should n=
ot see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since =
they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are =
the guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it =
regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who "should" have tr=
ansmission service rather than get on with providing it.=20

Subject:=09Update - NERC Version of Legislation

Rick

The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NERC acti=
vities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly ENRON-NE=
RC team conference call.

John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length of its =
proposed "Title on Reliability" so as to look more like the PJM approach.  =
Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to push f=
or the embodiment of deference by FERC to the "SRO" in the legislation. =20

Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook and Jef=
f Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NERC sta=
keholders to "finalize" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request to spe=
ak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of deferenc=
e to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting Organi=
zation - SSO).

The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to present =
issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q Anderson =
or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discussions =
with NERC, John Shelk plans to "stay the line" on the Enron position of kee=
ping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language that =
defers to the SSO out of the legislation. =20

Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if Enron=
 is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not through legi=
slation, rather through FERC "comfort" that the SSO is doing a good job.  B=
y knowing that FERC can "pull the plug" on the SSO if it is not satisfied, =
this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no indus=
try segment dominates the standards setting process.

I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to resolve/=
address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples of wh=
y NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules that al=
l its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be powerfu=
l arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authority in t=
he legislation. =20

We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation principles w=
ith Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.

Jim. Hope we can get together in Houston next week  to exchange notes.=20

Charles maybe we can have an extended meting Tuesday to get everyone up to =
speed.

 At the NERC meeting today the Independent Board of Trustees asserted their=
 independence by agreeing to the inputs of the stakeholders members and pas=
sing resolutions directing NERC   to be implement certain policy directives=
.

They (the Board) clearly see that FERC would have overall approval of regul=
atory commercial standards and practices. They know that NERC has to "compe=
te" for a role in a future model for the industry.. and would like to organ=
ization to have a future.

On a parallel track, we hear that there is lots of interest in reliability =
legislation. We need to keep track of what is happening there.=20

>From EPSA I heard that EEI has had members discussions about what to suppor=
t in the future.

The EEI observer told the audience that NERC has a very short time to put a=
 credible proposal on the table or they will be left behind.

Jose & Charles --

Thanks for the update.  I am concerned that "customers" are talking about h=
aving NERC deal with commercial matters without first agreeing to FERC's co=
ntrol over everything? =20

We should discuss the Goulding Report when you return.

Subject:=09Re: Stakeholder Committee Notes

To add to Charles memo..

1) The Trustees were all present to listen the debate at the stakeholders c=
ommittee. That was very positive.

2) The agenda order was changed to allow ample time to discuss the issues.=
=20

3) Time and time again it was stated that NERC was running out of time to m=
ake the required transition. If not alternatives would be pursued; example =
EISB

4) Time and time it was stated that the Goulding task force Recommendations=
 should be taken as a package, as a necessary first step.  These include:

1. Committee Representation . The Task Force recommends that the NERC Board=
 direct the standing committees to modify the standing committees represent=
ation and voting to reflect the Task Force's attached "Initial Sectors and =
Criteria Model." This Model is based on the Task Force's preference for rep=
resentation by "sector," and incorporates the Task Force's general recognit=
ion that an RTO sector should be included. The Task Force recognizes that s=
ome work remains to be done to refine the definitions of each sector and th=
e criteria for belonging, but believes that the Initial Sectors and Criteri=
a Model is an appropriate next step and should be taken immediately. Assumi=
ng that it may take some months to put in place the details of the new Mode=
l, including the new weighted voting procedures, the Task Force recommends =
that two ISO/RTO representatives be added immediately to each of the existi=
ng standing committees to provide formal representation and a voting role f=
or ISOs/RTOs until the Initial Sectors and Criteria Model has been implemen=
ted.

2. Committee Participation and Voting . The Task Force recommends open part=
icipation in each sector, subject to certain criteria and qualifications. T=
he Task Force has evaluated the qualification criteria and voting procedure=
s used in several Regions (ERCOT and MAAC), and has incorporated features o=
f those procedures into the recommended participation and voting procedures=
. Specifically, the Task Force recommends weighted voting by and within eac=
h sector, similar to what is done in MAAC.

3. Due Process . The new Organization Standards Process, which will be pres=
ented to the Board in October, addresses most due process issues and concer=
ns. The Task Force recommends implementing this new process immediately.

4. One-Stop Shop . The Task Force favors having a single organization for d=
eveloping Reliability Standards, Market Interface Practices, and Commercial=
 Practices. The Task Force believes that NERC has an opportunity to reinven=
t itself to become this organization, and should take definitive steps in t=
hat direction at its October 2001 Board and Stakeholders Committee meetings=
.

5. Funding . The Task Force recommends that steps be taken immediately to d=
ecouple the funding of NERC from the Regional Reliability Councils. The Fun=
ding Task Group recommendations, adopted by the Board in February 2001, sho=
uld be pursued.

6. MIC Role in Standards Approval . The Task Force recommends, as an immedi=
ate step to address concerns with the current NERC Standards Approval Proce=
ss, and to provide a "bridge" until the new Organization Standards process =
is implemented, requiring the MIC to vote on all new/proposed NERC Operatin=
g Policies and Planning Standards and report results to the Board, includin=
g consideration of any minority positions.

5) Lots of discussion about EISB and how NERC may interface with it as a po=
ssible alternative.

6) Silence on the issue of "self regulating organization" . No one advocati=
ng that position.

7) Good opportunity to speak with Trustees one-on-one at dinner.

Subject:=09Stakeholder Committee Notes

Here are some bullet points of what transpired at the NERC meeting in Vanco=
uver this Monday.

The customers met for almost 2 hours before the start of the SHC meeting.  =
Reps from Enron, Mirant, Dynegy, DENA, APPA and ELCON were present.

All agreed that a unified voice is needed to show strong direction from the=
 customer side.  This may mean putting aside some internal positions.  Cust=
omers need to show support of the Goulding Task Force recommendations which=
 offers a package deal to move NERC forward as a single standards setting o=
rganization for both reliability and commercial issues. The Goulding Task F=
orce recommendations do fall short of asking for NERC action.

Agenda Item 5 - Scope of NERC over Commercial Issues
To ensure unity in appearance, customers agreed to maintain discussions in =
front of the Independents at a higher policy level.   Many details are need=
ed to get individual entities "on board" however, such details should not i=
mpede on the ability for customers to show strong support on principles, i.=
e.-one-stop-shop, balance of membership, etc.  Therefore, all agreed to kee=
p details out of the discussion, i.e.-funding, seats, charter, etc.

The actual SHC discussion was constructive, and persons articulated the nee=
d for a package deal to the room. The debate brough the expected concerns o=
f the transmission providers to the surface.  TVA (Terry Boston) was most v=
ocal about keeping NERC out of the commercial side.   Dominion Resources (G=
lenn Ross) supported the customers' position.  PJM (Phil Harris was also su=
pportive). =20

Agenda Item 6 - Independence of Security Coordinators
Comments made that this is a long standing stalemate at NERC and that NERC =
does not have the authourity to require corporate independence. Suggestions=
 made to perform better and more audits.  Dave Penn brought up the memo fro=
m Roy Thilly.  Need to ask the Board to bring this issue to FERC for resolu=
tion.  Good arguments made by customers on need for independence in a new c=
ompetitive market structure.  FRCC (Wiley) made arguments that the NERC sho=
uld not revamp policies to police the few bad apples.  Should deal directly=
 and specifically with the problem.=20

A straw poll was taken of the persons in the room over recommending actions=
:
1) NERC should require corporate indepdence and ask FERC to address it.
2) NERC should focus in on the problem Security Coordinators and take speci=
fic actions to safeguard independent judgement (audits)

The vote was 21/24.  There were strong comments that this vote was not inte=
nded to be an industry representative vote, only to show how split the indu=
stry is over this issue.

The meeting adjourned for lunch and the Independents left after the meeting=
 reconvened.
The SHC agreed to ask the BOT the following:

?=09Establish a goal/vision to become the one stop shop for development of =
wholesale electric industry standards. =20
?=09Add words that "we need to go forward from where we are.
?=09Take immediate action to adopt the initial recommendations contained in=
 new Board agenda item 22.
?=09Actively solicit cooperation collaboration and support from Canadian an=
d US government entities.
?=09Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state=
 and provincial regulators, and other stakeholder organizations - an open a=
nd inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes=
 of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric indus=
try standards and practices, an on a course of action to institute such cap=
abilities.
?=09Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operat=
ion issues as they affect wholesale operations.

Agenda Item 9 -Transmission Expansion
Reference to "incentive rates", and "accelerated amortization", should be r=
emoved, not a reliability policy need.=20
The reference to these expansion solutions are intended to be tutorial and =
does not assume NERC will begin to undertake rate issues.  APPA - public pe=
rception will be different.  Must remove this language.  Glen Ross will pre=
sent this report to the Independents outlining the strong opinions on both =
sides.

Jeff,

I look forward to our call Thursday regarding the Enron position on electric
reliability legislation and NERC's role. Here is a marked up copy as well as
a clean copy showing the latest proposal that we would expect NERC to offer
up. This is apparently still a very different approach from that proposed by
PJM.

Regards,

John

John,

This is the shorter version of the reliability language that is under
discussion.  It's redlined to show the changes from the longer version.
It was developed by lawyers for EEI, APPA and the Canadian Electricity
Association, with our encouragement and advice.  In the Senate hearing
last week I told Senator Bingaman that I thought we could develop
shorter language that still contained the essentials we need for an SRO.
I believe this draft would do that.  We've asked for comment from all
concerned by tomorrow.  Early returns indicate that all who support the
current language will also support the shorter version.  It is unclear
whether we will pick up any additional supporters (like ELCON, Enron, or
EPSA), although some of them have said the draft is a step in the right
direction.  Thanks for your help.

Christi,

This is probably one of the stupidest things I have ever heard.  NERC is about as secure as a convenience store at two in the morning.  They have almost no experience dealing with security, either cyber or otherwise. They are using the terrorist attacks on the 11th as a reason to blow the dust off all their old Y2K contingency plans and cash in on people's fears to strengthen their position.

In any case, I would suspect that a large RTO with a significant budget is much more likely to be secure than a dues based NERC. Look at NERC's offices.  They are in a shopping mall.  How secure is that?  Last time I visited, they didn't even have any sort of identity cards or badge system or anything - the whole place was wide open.  Anyone could walk in off the street and shut down a large portion of NERC's infrastructure by just randomly unplugging computers.  

Contrast that with places like ISO-NE and NY-ISO, who have significant levels of security in their systems that are extremely sophisticated and complex. Or compare that with the MISO's hardened facility, capable of withstanding an F-4 tornado hit.  You tell me whether NERC or RTOs are going to be more secure.

Dave is right on with his classification of the idea of NIMDA being an attack on the electric utility industry as preposterous.  That's akin to saying that a chain letter is an attack on the banking industry because bank statements come in the mail.  And Dan points out a more valid thing to consider - a terrorist isn't going to attack a tariff desk, market system, or security coordinator; they will attack nuclear units, substations, and other installations that actually matter.   

I echo Dave's question - do we want to "call" NERC on this issue?  It would be a very simple exercise to point to NERC's many security failings, including some initiatives they are currently sitting on.  Bringing up the right details in the right forums could really undermine their reputation and nip this positioning in the bud.

(By the way - am I the only one who got a kick out of that article pointing out this 3rd grade cleverness of "NIMDA is ADMIN spelled backwards"?  Gotta love journalists - always trying to find an angle.  Next they'll say that the 60 in "2600" refers to the frequency of the interconnection!)

Our NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making statements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comments in these document look more like "this should be reviewed".)
Do we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group perform a study that includes redunancy issues, etc. to counter this?  Certainly, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell's testimony to Congress indicate that they believe that large RTOs will bring more security and reliability (we have included this in our SE RTO mediation comments.)

DATE: September 25, 2001

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC made during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The statements concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization, particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing control center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 "the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some facilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted that this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they indicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NIMBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've played not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "reliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events make transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised.  

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, the legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the NERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meeting.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future discussions of these matters. 

Please provide your reactions to the NERC statements to Mark Bennett at 202-628-8200 or mbennett@epsa.org

This document, although lengthy, contains insight to what NERC's BOT may be 
asked to endorse as far as establishment of a NERC position on reliabilty 
standards and market practices.  It also has implications on how to split the 
baby between NERC and GISB.

I suggest all to review this draft and be ready to provide the MIC feedback 
when it appears on their agenda.  I am unsure if it will show up in the July 
meeting, perhaps Terry Lane of Dynegy, who is on the subcommittee that put 
this together can provide us with more info.

Mark, please forward this to the EPSA-NAERO group list.

Thursday morning, August 2nd, Jeff Skilling held a conference call with John Q Anderson, one of 9 independent Board members of NERC, to discuss Enron's position on the NERC version of reliability legislation.  Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes were present on the call.

John Anderson's purpose for the call with Jeff was to find out what Enron wanted to see in legislation in order for Enron to give deference to NERC to become a Self-Regulated Organization for setting reliability standards.

Jeff explained that the PJM version has a more likeable approach than the NERC version, PJM's is less prescriptive and relies more on FERC participation in establishing a "SRO".  Additionally, funding concerns are not addressed in either version and a viable funding mechanism that does not rely on Regional Councils is needed.

Jeff also would like to make a presentation (as soon as possible) to the NERC Board of Trustees of the key items Enron would like to see resolved that would provide Enron enough confidence that the NERC/NAERO organization would be independent enough from the stakeholders and be willing enough to tackle the industry's toughest issues concerning competitive markets in electricity.  

I will be working with the Enron-NERC team on a breifing paper of what we want NERC to fix in current NERC rules and processes for NERC to demonstrate it is worthy of the "SRO" status.  Some example issues include:
1) Indpendence requirements for operators and Security Coordinators
2) competitive advantages of control areas - parking and hubbing
3) competitive advantages of native and network service - source and sink data requirements

I spoke with Bob Cummings yesterday in the airport.  Apparently, he has been working with DoE on a security project that he expects will be funded by them.  I believe this will be the digital certificate type of security the OSC has talked about in the past (the E-Marc proposal).  Instead of being used as originally intended to provide authentication functions for reservations and scheduling, it looks like it is being considered for securing informational items as well.  From what I understand, Pacific Northwest National Labs and Lockheed Martin have been in discussions with NERC about providing service under this DoE initiative.

He also stated that NERC plans to limit access to more data soon - perhaps as much as the entire NERC website, so that viewers must be registered with NERC, in order to do background checks and such before giving access. 

One caveat - Bob sometimes likes to inflate his work to make himself appear more important (check me out, I'm talking to DoE and big contractors), so this may really be a few casual phone calls and general statements, rather than any sort of formal project.  But given the action we've seen lately, it may be a real project we should be investigating further.  I expect that once the board gives the go ahead, NERC plans to run this through as quickly as possible and rush for a quick implementation.  

I would guess the likely approach is going to be, following an approving board decision, a relatively quick lockdown of their site, to be followed by a priority-one security infrastructure project like the one described in my first paragraph.  I would not be surprised if they also encourage other entities to lockdown their systems more tightly.  

I don't know if there is any real action we can take right now, but obviously, this draws more attention to the issue as we move forward into next week.  Obviously, please be discreet in mentioning these details, as I don't want Bob to get skittish.  These issues may not be confidential, but then again, they might.

Please also note that I did not include Dick Ingersoll on this communiqu?.  I am not sure under what disclosure policies he is still bound (if any).

WEB SITES REMOVE DOCUMENTS
U.S. government departments and agencies also have been stripping a wide range of documents from Web sites in recent days because of perceived threats to such critical systems as pipelines, water supply stations and power plants. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, for instance, took down its entire Web site Thursday to review its content for "information that might be useful to adversaries," said spokeswoman Rosetta Virgilio. 
She said many other federal agencies also appeared to be in the process of removing such information from their sites. 
The Transportation Department's Bureau of Transportation Statistics has cut off public access to databases used for mapping because of stepped-up concern about U.S. transportation infrastructure. 
The Environmental Protection Agency has dismantled its risk-management Web site, which contains general information about emergency plans and chemicals used at 15,000 sites nationwide.

Its my turn, sorry I havent jumped in til now, computer problems.

At a EPSA sponsored meeting on Aug 9, the GISB Chair and Rae McQuade sat do=
wn and we went through what it takes to get EISB rolling and how they would=
 tackle the tough issues at NERC.

I beleive the EPSA folks in the room, Mirant, Dynegy, Ontario Power Gen, En=
ron, Exelon, Calpine  and ELCON all felt that there shouls be one organizat=
ion setting standards because of the inherent risks of assuming reliability=
 and commercial issues can be sleanly separated.  We came away from the mee=
ting with a comfort level that the GISB process will provide the right mech=
anism to resolve this age old debate - I don't care what kind of standard y=
ou call it - if you write it - it must be put through the GISB/EISB wringer=
.  GISB recommended that perhaps what we know as NERC today could be given =
a segment in the energy quadrant.
=20
Also to respond to Sarah's note about support for an SRO - no entity in the=
 room supported that FERC give deference to ANY standards organization - no=
t NERC, NAERO, GISB or RTOs.  So I think we need to hold tight to this issu=
e and we will be able to rally support for it.

I will speak at the GISB conference next Wed, Aug 15 at DOE.  I am working =
with Mark Bennett and other EPSA folks on key principles of what EPSA wants=
 from the EISB Strawman.

I have attached notes I put together that will evolve into the statements I=
 will make on behalf of EPSA.

Please proviede me your thoughts.

Also - I agree with Dick, today, NERC is 12.5 million dollars annually, and=
 mostly utility dollars.  If we are going to push for a EISB, we have to pr=
ovide some carrot for these utilities to agree to let EISB do this.  NERC (=
and their supporters) will fall on their sword on funding and the reult wil=
l be we have 2 organizations setting standards if NERC cannot agree to beco=
me a part of the EISB process. =20

And one more thing, I don't know how much commitment Jeff Skilling feels he=
 has to the Independent Baord members, many of which he helped get seated. =
 But pushing for EISB and perhaps wrapping NERC into it as the reliability =
piece (GISB's suggestion) - may render the Independents obsolete.  I don't =
know if are wedded to them.

I agree with Steve although I've articulated a different point of view at t=

After reading the FTC document, I am concerned that we are loosing sight of=
 the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission ser=
vice.  It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedu=
les will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by it=
s performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard=
 against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit =
ISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minim=
ize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require =
the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) =
The opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cove=
r their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely. =20

If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rule=
s would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the vali=
dity of the "reliability provisions" of the tariffs the FERC will be requir=
ed to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have th=
e expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and=
 is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting=
 Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of th=
e industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to=
 complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally c=
oncerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the=
 service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in=
 most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce th=
e rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National=
 Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accompl=
ished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, et=
c.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are in=
corporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff woul=
d incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rule=
s or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action =
can be taken to enforce.

My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the m=
ajor function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should n=
ot see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since =
they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are =
the guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it =
regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who "should" have tr=
ansmission service rather than get on with providing it.=20

=09=09Subject:=09Update - NERC Version of Legislation

=09=09Rick

=09=09The following discussion is to bring you up to date on the latest NER=
C activities on reliability legislation that was a subject on the weekly EN=
RON-NERC team conference call.

=09=09John Shelk explained that NERC has significantly reduced the length o=
f its proposed "Title on Reliability" so as to look more like the PJM appro=
ach.  Fundamentally, there are still major differences.  NERC continues to =
push for the embodiment of deference by FERC to the "SRO" in the legislatio=
n. =20

=09=09Given the conference call last week with John Q Anderson, Dave Cook a=
nd Jeff Skilling, we were concerned how the upcoming meeting on Aug 9 by NE=
RC stakeholders to "finalize" the NERC version would impact Jeff's request =
to speak with the Independent Board members before accepting any form of de=
ference to NERC to become the SRO (or the term we prefer Standards Setting =
Organization - SSO).

=09=09The meeting on the 9th should not interfere with Jeff's ability to pr=
esent issues to the Board.  We don't think Jeff needs to contact John Q And=
erson or any NERC members about the Aug 9 meeting.  However, for the discus=
sions with NERC, John Shelk plans to "stay the line" on the Enron position =
of keeping authority to defer to any SSO with FERC and to keep any language=
 that defers to the SSO out of the legislation. =20

=09=09Jeff should still be able to argue for key Board action items, and if=
 Enron is appeased, deference to NERC could still be given - but not throug=
h legislation, rather through FERC "comfort" that the SSO is doing a good j=
ob.  By knowing that FERC can "pull the plug" on the SSO if it is not satis=
fied, this will provide the correct incentive for the SSO to ensure that no=
 industry segment dominates the standards setting process.

=09=09I am completing a draft of issues that we want the Independents to re=
solve/address for Jeff Skilling to take to the Board.
=09=09Additionally, Andy Rodriquez and I will develop a summary of examples=
 of why NERC, in its current form, is not able to develop consensus rules t=
hat all its members are willing to comply with.  These examples should be p=
owerful arguments for John Shelk to leverage in arguments for FERC authorit=
y in the legislation. =20

=09=09We also discussed the need to shop our reliability legislation princi=
ples with Pat Wood and perhaps DOE.

Can you please work together to have a presentation on NERC matters - 

what we're doing?
what NERC is focused on?
what we don't need to do?
etc?

I would like to have some presentation material and a 1 hour phone call 
hopefully by May 25 (I'm out on holiday May 16 - May 18) to discuss.

I want to make sure that we are fully aligned with the commercial and RTO

Ladies and Gentlemen:

For Immediate Release:

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) released its 2001
Summer Assessment today.  "The assessment concludes that California will
experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this
summer," said Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, "and California
electricity users will experience rotating blackouts, much more so than
last summer or this winter."  The report also states that extreme
drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the
available output of hydroelectric resources.  "We expect that utilities
in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands
this summer," he added, "but they will not have electricity available to
export to California and elsewhere."

For your convenience, a copy of the press release announcing the 2001
Summer Assessment is shown below. In addition, this press release as
well as the subject reports are available from the NERC web site
www.nerc.com.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Sincerely,

Julie Morgan

NERC Releases its 2001 Summer Reliability Assessment

The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) released its 2001
Summer Assessment today.  "The assessment concludes that California will
experience difficulties meeting its projected electricity demand this
summer," said Michehl R. Gent, NERC President and CEO, "and California
electricity users will experience rotating blackouts, much more so than
last summer or this winter."  The report also states that extreme
drought conditions throughout the Pacific Northwest will affect the
available output of hydroelectric resources.  "We expect that utilities
in the Pacific Northwest will be able to serve all of their firm demands
this summer," he added, "but they will not have electricity available to
export to California and elsewhere."

In addition, the report cautions that New England, New York City, and
Texas should be closely watched, despite having adequate resources to
meet demand.  New England and New York City are particularly sensitive
to long-term heat waves and higher-than-expected generating unit forced
outages.  Texas will undergo a major shift in its operation in June when
it opens up to full retail access and consolidates ten control area
operations into one.  The report concludes that generating capacity
resources should be adequate to meet projected electricity demands in
other areas of North America this summer.

 The assessment also points to concerns regarding north-to-south
transmission transfer capability in the eastern portion of the United
States, particularly east of the Mississippi River.  The ability to
transfer electricity from the north to the south in the Eastern
Interconnection was severely tested last summer, spurred by cool
temperatures in the north and hot temperatures in the south, as well as
high fuel prices in the south.  Early indications are that key
transmission interfaces used to transfer electricity from north to south
are already fully subscribed going into this summer, and that
transmission congestion will again be prevalent in this area throughout
the summer.

 As a supplement to its 2001 Summer Assessment report, NERC also
published a 2001 Summer Special Assessment.  This document is an
in-depth, independent examination of the expected summer conditions in
both California and the Pacific Northwest, and is based on interviews
with experts from both the California Independent System Operator
(CAISO) and the Northwest Power Pool (NWPP).

 NERC's CAISO assessment agrees with the overall conclusions of
both the CAISO and the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) ? the
CAISO will not have sufficient resources to meet expected demand this
summer and involuntary curtailments of firm customer demand (rotating
blackouts) are expected.  NERC expects supply deficiencies to be greater
than those expected by the CAISO.  NERC anticipates that firm demand may
be curtailed for about 260 hours over the course of this summer, with an
average firm demand curtailment of about 2,150 MW.

 NERC expects that electric utilities in the NWPP will be able to
serve all their firm electricity demands this summer.  However, NWPP
will not have the ability to export the amounts of electricity it
traditionally has to California or elsewhere due to limited energy
output from hydroelectric facilities resulting from one of the worst
water years on record.

The independent reports, prepared by NERC's Reliability Assessment
Subcommittee, assess the projected demand and the resources available to
meet that demand this summer, as well as transmission reliability
issues.  The reports are posted on NERC's web site at www.nerc.com.  The
web site also includes information on NERC and its transformation into
NAERO, and the electric industry's electricity supply and delivery
programs and activities.

Christi ,

 I  completely agree with Dave .In addition to the levels of redundancy he =
states  it is important to note that the Central Control Centers are more o=
f a communication and dispatch hub but the actual control of  the circuit b=
reakers , transformers, phase angle regulators and  voltage control devices=
(the reliability backbone) resides within the "sub control centers " of the=
 Transmission Operators like Con Edison, Florida Power &Light  etc etc..The=
 destruction of one of the major RTO control centers will not shut down tra=
nsmission lines or trip generators off line .There would be loss of communi=
cation to the region or local control centers and there may be some out of =
merit generation moves but it would not be a disaster . With the  redundanc=
y of control centers, computers ,communications and data acquisition along =
with the proper protocols and procedures the loss should  not severely effe=
ct the security or reliability of the transmission grid .This redundancy wi=
ll be an important part of the RTO development but there is no valid reason=
 to slow up the present pace of progress because of this issue.

I believe there are much more vulnerable areas within the Transmission grid=
 that NERC should be concerned about and address . I am open to continue th=
is discussion off line .   Dan =20

Subject:=09RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

Christi,

The NERC statements clearly seem to indicate they feel threatened by the RT=
O formation process and EISB.

Frankly, nothing stated anywhere in the attachments hasn't already been tho=
ught out and handled by the three ISOs in the East and the CAISO as well.  =
All four of these entities have fully functional back-up facilities in othe=
r parts of their regions and NERC is fully aware of them.  I would assume E=
RCOT also has a fully functional, redundant control scheme in place as well=
.

In the case of NY there is another site physically apart from the main cont=
rol center which has a fully redundant computer and communications system. =
 They have (or used to have) plans which in the event neither center is ava=
ilable, can revert control back to the TOs (heaven forbid)  until ISO perso=
nnel can resume control of the grid.  So they have 3 sets of redundancy, in=
 addition to radio and satellite communications if necessary.

Earlier RTO West discussions all contained similar concerns and plans for r=
edundancy and the DSTAR preliminary design documents also plan on redundanc=
y.  NERCs assertion that they would "slow-down" the RTO formation process i=
s absurd (geez, it's going too slow now!!!).=20

Running distributed, synchronized computer networks is not rocket science..=
.how do the folks at NERC explain the NYSE quick recovery from a ground zer=
o attack?  There was no report of crippling loss of financial information..=
.at least that I am aware of.  Even a small operation like APX operates the=
ir systems using distributed computing and synchronized data.

For NERC to use the NIMDA virus as a specific attack on the electrical grid=
 operation and the compromising of reliability is preposterous and the resu=
lting "service denials" cited are probably refusal(s) of tags, which from w=
hat I understand, the utilities probably cause much more self-inflicted hav=
oc than this virus!

The press release you refer to just confirms NERC's position of maintaining=
 status quo.  Should we "call" NERC on these statements?  The remarks made =
in these public statements seem irresponsible.

Kind Regards,

Dave=20

Our NERC folks should be able to shed more light on why NERC is making stat=
ements that on their face look anti-large RTO (the other emails and comment=

Do we (and other market participants) need to have a computer systems group=

RE: NERC Statements on Impact of Security Threats on RTOs

The attached e-mail in Microsoft Word form contains statements that NERC ma=
de during a recent meeting with members of the national press.  The stateme=
nts concern NERC's view of the implications of terrorist threats for FERC's=
 " Four RTO policy" set forth in its July 12th Order.  The statements also =
may bear upon the effort to establish a new standards setting organization,=
 particularly the possibility that NERC's responsibilities could be shifted=
 to EISB.  Also attached is an article containing the views of R.J. Rudden =
Associates, Inc. that discusses the risks associated with centralizing cont=
rol center operations.

Specifically, NERC representatives informed the press that on September 11 =
"the grid was the target of an insidious cyber attack that shut down some f=
acilities...from an information administration standpoint."  They noted tha=
t this resulted in service denials, although it is not clear whether they i=
ndicated where or how much.  This event was attributed to the so-called "NI=
MBA virus".

NERC's statements suggest a new strategy to preserve the role they've playe=
d not only in security matters, but possibly other aspects pertaining to "r=
eliability standards."  They warn against any immediate transition to fewer=
 RTOs as envisioned in FERC's July 12th Order.  Moreover, it is likely that=
 NERC will argue that, given its expertise and experience, recent events ma=
ke transitioning to a new standards organization (EISB?) ill advised. =20

It is unclear what, if any, impact all this may have on RTO development, th=
e legislative effort to establish a new reliability standards body or the N=
ERC Board's consideration of pending reform proposals at its October meetin=
g.  However, we can expect security related issues to be included in future=
 discussions of these matters.=20

Bullet 4:
FERC cannot directly "amend" a proposed standard (I was told this is because the Canadians would object to FERC telling them what to do directly); however, FERC can remand a proposed standard to the ERO for a modification by a date certain.  The proposed standard is not implemented until the modification is made.  (In some cases, a proposed standard takes effect automatically if FERC fails to act on the proposed standard within a specified period of time.)

At the GISB - EPSA meeting last Thurs, the GISB people clearly stated that GISB has NO authority over its members, it is 100% voluntary.  All the muscle lies in FERC and any governmental agency that is willing to adopt the GISB standard.  Agencies in Mexico for example have adopted certain GISB standards.  In fact, ANSI acreditaion requires that the standards setting organization NOT to have authority.  So it makes sense for FERC to not amend a proposed standard since other agencies will have to be able to adopt it.(e.g.- Canada)  I don't see a problem with this - but this makes the consensus building process even more important since the final product must be amenable to any and all relevant governement authorities.  

This is a good reason why the legislation cannot give deference to the ERO, especially one which proposes to have compliance and enforcement authority as NERC's proposal.  If NERC is going to set standards AND have compliance authority over its members - then the ANSI acreditation they claim to be getting will not be the same as that of GISB.  ANSI does not allow this combination.  If the deference language is in the legislation - that means the GISB/EISB proposal is excluded from FERC's choice.  FERC needs to be aware of this.  So why does the voluntary GISB process with FERC oversight model work? 

It is the very nature of knowing FERC has final authority that makes the consensus building process work - not the threat of the ERO's compliance authority over its members as NERC approaches this.  In GISB, the  members know that if they do not produce a standard that all its members and FERC can live with - FERC will not adopt it, nor can FERC amend it - and since no enforcement mechanism will be behind the mis-guided standard (remember it is 100% voluntary), it becomes a worthless exercise.  This is a powerful incentive.   

On the other hand, NERC's approach of a standards organization with enforcement power sets the stage for power struggles between sectors and knocks down the consensus building attitude the GISB process encourages.   Compliance and penalites are not assigned or targeted to every member/sector.  Certain parties are impacted by certain standards - and in different ways. For example - a congestion management standard will affect a control area very differently than it would a power marketer.  The penalites may not apply at all to the marketers who want to protect themselves by making the congestion management penalites as harsh as possible and vice versa for the control areas.  If the ERO doles out compliance without FERC approval - then the standards will become a battleground over compliance and penalties. The point is the enforcement and penalty debate will drive sector arguments and will cloud the real task of developing an equitable congestion management standard.

Subject:	Summary of "Final Draft" of NERC "Electric Reliability Organization" Legislation


Attached is a summary I did of the key points in the Final Draft of the NERC reliability legislation, as amended yesterday.  While it is now shorter than the old version, and some of the objectional features have been deleted or watered down, I assume we still do not support the final version.  We and others who attended these meetings have been asked to provide our comments and position by close of business on Thursday, August 16th.  I thought the summary would help highlight the major features so we can evaluate the final version in light of our concerns and interests in this subject.  Your comments are welcome.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group
       Legislative Affairs Committee

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Scott Weiner, Legislative Affairs Committee Chair
            Mark Bennett, Senior Manager of Policy
            Donn Salvosa, Manager of Government Affairs

DATE: August 16, 2001

RE: Reliability Legislation

We are providing you with this memo to provide some information and perspective on the important issues relating to federal legislation in advance of our August 20th joint Regulatory Affairs and Legislative Affairs meeting on reliability legislation.

Reliability Legislation

S. 2071

S. 2071, sponsored by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-WA), was approved by the Senate in the last Congress.  The House of Representatives did not act on the bill.  S. 2071 represents the only consensus bill to be approved by either chamber.  

This legislation would establish a national electric reliability organization (ERO) with the authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability standards.  

FERC would have primary jurisdiction over:

? the electric reliability organization (ERO);

? all Affiliated Regional Reliability Entities (entities to which authority would 
  be delegated to enforce compliance with reliability standards); 

? all system operators; and 

? all users of the bulk-power system. 

The bill prescribes procedural guidelines for FERC approval of applications competing for status as the ERO and ERO standards. It would also require all users of the transmission system to comply with such standards.

What causes us some concern are a number of provisions in the legislation that would delegate authority to different entities.  The bill would:

? Allow the ERO, subject to FERC approval, to delegate authority to a 
  requesting regional entity to implement and enforce compliance with 
  standards.  

? Include a broad savings clause which preserves state authority to "ensure 
  the safety, adequacy and reliability of electric service within each state." 

? Not ensure that the boundaries of ARREs and RTOs are the same, 
  although it would instruct ARREs to cooperate with RTOs to ensure 
  enforcement of standards. 

A similar bill - H.R. 2602 - was introduced in the House last session by Rep. Albert Wynn (D-MD). No action was taken on this bill.  The same language is included in the comprehensive energy bill introduced by Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM).  

Other Developments
 
Last year, in response to failed attempts by the Congress to pass comprehensive electricity legislation, a number of groups headed by NERC, sent a letter to House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-IL), calling for the passage of stand alone reliability legislation.  The letter is attached.  A number of groups, including public power groups, the California ISO, Edison Electric Institute, NARUC and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association all signed the letter.  

EPSA was strongly pressured to sign the letter to add more weight and credibility to the effort.  However, we did not sign the letter.  While we stated that we did not oppose the letter, EPSA's position at the time was the advocacy for comprehensive federal legislation. 

Last month, a number of groups with interests in reliability legislation met in Washington in an attempt to forge an agreement on legislation that can be supported by industry stakeholders.  Efforts were made to shorten the existing legislation similar to the bill introduced by Rep. Albert Wynn without changing the intent of provisions in the language.  In addition to EPSA, other groups in attendance included NARUC, the Pennsylvania PUC, Entergy, PJM , Public Power Groups, Consumer Groups, ELCON, Mirant and Enron.  The meeting produced a realization among the participants on the wide difference of opinions on how best to proceed.  The state PUCs lobbied for a continued state role in reliability language.  Entergy supported the original language contained in the Bingaman bill.  Still, a number of other groups favored the shorter PJM version.  

PJM Proposal

PJM recently circulated condensed reliability language.  The 4-page bill would give enforcement authority to FERC.  If you would like a copy faxed to you, please contact Michael Reddy (mreddy@epsa.org) at EPSA.  Additionally, FERC would establish reliability standards and will maintain primary jurisdiction.  FERC would designate a national reliability entity composed of a number of regional entities for the purpose of developing reliability standards for the transmission system.  

Some concerns over the PJM language include:

? Formation of regional entities that would be a "bottoms up" organization. 
  These entities would have no regard to how they conform with RTOs. 

? Reliability standards would be developed as voluntary consensus 
  standards

? The regions and the national entity would be on equal ground.

Revised NERC language

Just last Thursday NERC convened another meeting for the purposes of attempting to shorten the original NERC language.  Working off of the language found in the Wynn bill, the new language was shortened to 16 pages.  The red-lined version is attached.  Among the noteworthy changes:

? p. 6, applications for approval to become the ERO, strikes language to 
  specify funding mechanisms and requirements.  

? p. 13, changes in filings of funding and funding procedures, language 
  deleted on specifics on changes to funding.

? p. 21, additional language added to state that neither the ERO nor FERC 
  will have the authority to order construction of additional generation or 
  transmission if it determines a need.

? p. 22, language on coordination with RTOs deleted.

Status and Prospects of Legislation

The Republican House and the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, chaired by Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-LA) and Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality Chairman Joe Barton (R-TX) has maintained the position that electricity should be addressed in a comprehensive fashion.  This is a continuation of the position held by Former House Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley (R-VA).   Staff for Chairman Tauzin are in the process of developing electricity provisions during the August recess.  It is likely that one of the titles will be on reliability.   

The Senate, with its recent switch in control, remains uncertain on the overall view of stand alone reliability legislation.  In its present version, Senate Energy Chairman Bingaman's bill contains the same reliability provisions found in the Wynn bill.  Chairman Bingaman also plans to markup legislation in the Fall.  

Regulatory/NERC/GISB Developments

While the timing and details of reliability legislation remain uncertain, NERC has continued its effort to transition to NAERO.  When first envisioned several years ago, the legislative objective was to establish NAERO as a self-regulatory organization with authority to enforce mandatory reliability standards.  Legislative delays, however, led the NERC Board to take unilateral steps to advance the transition, beginning with its governance structure. 

Last February, the 38 member board was replaced by a new board of ten independent board members.  Members of the former board then were reconstituted as the new Stakeholder Committee with an advisory role, in addition to authority to participate in funding, board member changes and a few other general matters.  Also, the board implemented a compliance program based upon contracts to be executed by the Regional Reliability Councils.  Funding for NERC, presently administered by the regions, remains an extremely problematic, open question, as is the continued dominance of transmission providers in the current NERC Standing Committee voting structure.

The GISB proposal to include a wholesale electric quadrant in the new Energy Industry Standards Board (EISB) has provided an alternative that didn't exist at the time the NAERO concept, and related legislative effort, began.  The EISB model, which would combine the development of gas and electric retail and wholesale standards, initially viewed as a remote prospect when it was floated in early 2000, has gained substantial momentum.  

During FERC's June 19th technical conference on Function 8 and interregional coordination, the Commissioners compared the circumstances in the gas industry that led to the formation of GISB with those of the electric industry today.  In separate letters to GISB Executive Director Rae McQuade dated August 13th, Commissioners Massey, Wood and Brownell observed the need to develop uniform rules and standards and expressed enthusiastic support for a new EISB to do it.  Those letters were distributed during an industry conference hosted by the Department of Energy (DOE) on August 14 - 15th, further contributing to the credibility of the EISB proposal.

Meanwhile, the pressure that the EISB proposal is generating clearly appears to have become part of the overall context for NERC's reform effort, as well as the reliability legislation.  A task force set up by the NERC Stakeholder Committee is reviewing how to make the three Standing Committees more "open and inclusive," including possible recommendations to change the voting structure from the current 50/50 (transmission provider/transmission customer) to a sector approach.  The NERC board may receive those recommendations, and other possible NERC reforms, including a new Organization Standards Process, when it meets in October.  

The effort to launch an EISB is expected to come to a head when the GISB board meets on September 19th.  There are indications that the board will approve going forward with the proposal.  Such action would considerably raise the stakes for the NERC board, and present challenging issues regarding how to set up the voting sectors within the wholesale electric quadrant.  

Additionally, the industry will need to consider how to more precisely define the types of standards the new organization would develop.  The emergence of a new EISB, if it occurs, could potentially diverge from legislation that presumes that NERC/NAERO will be the only standard setting organization.  Granting a new NAERO authority over "reliability" will beg serious questions regarding its scope of activities, and create the specter of multiple organizations that many hope to avoid.

There was an all day meeting of the NERC/reliability legislation group today.  I will provide a more detailed report, but the group completed the process of reviewing the changes that some had suggested to shorten and streamline the NERC "electric reliability organization" legislation.  Sarah and I asked a series of questions and made comments on our key issues and concerns.  I want to give you a more complete report once I have gone back over the now "final draft" version.  

The timing being imposed by NERC is that they will circulate a "clean" version of the proposal tomorrow or Monday.  They have asked for comments by next Thursday, August 16th, with an indication of whether each company/organization does or does not sign on to support it.  They will then transmit the proposal and the endorsement letter to Congress and the Administration so they have it as Hill and Energy Dept. staff work on electricity drafting issues this month.

I pointed out that EPSA is not due to meet internally with its members to discuss these issues until after the NERC deadline.  That is not deterring NERC from moving forward with the above time frame.

See NERC memo below that was just received.  They have scheduled what they hope will be the final meeting to "resolve" the reliability legislation next week -- August 9th.  Of course, this is awfully presumptuous in that it assumes that the model to be worked off of is the NERC model (even the shortened one), and not the PJM model that others prefer to use.  We need to decide whether we suggest any changes to the shortened NERC version, even those we know they would not take just to show a willingness to offer specific comments as we promised at the last meeting, or simply "agree to disagree."

Reliability legislation coalition

I have attached a memo outlining the edits that NERC would make in the
7/19 discussion draft.  My memo does not take account of the suggestions
that have been circulated in the last day or so.  I've also attached a
marked-up version of the 7/19 draft indicating our changes.

I propose that we meet in Washington on Thursday, August 9, at 10:00
a.m., with the goal of coming to closure on reliability legislation that
is shorter and less detailed than the language in the pending bills, but
that still preserves the essence of an industry self-regulatory
organization.  I am working on a location and expect to provide that
information tomorrow.

I know that scheduling this meeting may be difficult for some and that
schedules are already full, but schedules will become even more
difficult later in the month.  I take as our deadline having new
language for the Hill during the August recess.

Thank you in advance for your continuing efforts to bring this new model
for reliability into existence.

This is a direct result of the recent actions from GISB to get involved in the wholesale electric standards.   We and EPSA have made positive statements about the GISB process.  NERC has been forced to change to accomodate what many in the industry are looking for.  There are still many "ifs" at GISB at this time, much of it around how much the big utilitites would be willing to support it.  Our position has been - whoever provided the best deal first, that is where the industry will take its business.

Kevin's preferences for RTO standards is not out of the question.   FERC will utlimately decide how much standards setting authority the RTOs will have.   NERC will certainly foucs - at least - on inter-RTO standards, something RTOs will not do well, if at all.  Howvever, NERC must not impede on internal RTO market structures and rules - a "commercial standard"  - this is why NERC recognizing commercial interests is such a big step.

NERC Roster

The NERC Board, at its meeting today in Vancouver, took bold steps to
expand its role for developing standards for the wholesale electric
industry in North America, to ensure the independence of actions by its
21 Security Coordinators from any wholesale or retail merchant
functions, and agreed to revamp the composition and voting structure of
its standing committees.

Attached are the relevant resolutions and policy statements approved by
the Board.

A press release concerning these actions is available on the NERC web
site.

I have heard through EPSA the following "confirmations" to the NERC Stakeholder Committee.   These are the "customer" segments, of course, there are Utility, Muni, Coops, Canada, etc. members as well.  These names are uniffocial in that I have not seen an official notice/roster from the NERC office, but should be noticed shortly:

Marketer - Jose Bestard, Vice President, Government Affairs - Enron

Marketer - Craig Lsser, Senior Vice President, External and Regulatory Affairs - Mirant
		(an unknown in the NERC arena, Mirant of course is the former SoCo unaffiliated marketer, I have seen Miranat 			members participate in EPSA working groups)

Generator - Steve Gililland, Senior Vice President of Asset Management - Duke-Energy NA
		(a former NERC BOT member, Mike Gildea of Duke works closely with other EPSA members)

Generator - David McMillan, Director, System Optimization - Calpine

		(a former NERC CPWG(pre-MIC) member, former MidWest ISO staffer, former HL&P employee)

As you know, the Stakeholder Committee is an advisory body to the Independent Board of Trusteess.  The scope of its activites include but is not limited to NERC Budget approval - which is growing from a 2001 amount of $12.3 million to a proposed 2002 $13 million.  These seats are for 2 year terms.
