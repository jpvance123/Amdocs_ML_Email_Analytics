Julie,

A clarification. We had an agreement with Chris and Les to contribute  AUS 
10,000
as a part of the cost.

Vince,
Enron is fine (although I think we have to pay for the Hyatt anyway).
?
Good discount (I have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the  
weather desk's idea is probably different?):? for the one day, $1100 per  
person.? If you think that there will be?around 10 people or more,  then we 
can offer a day rate, regardless of the number of people.? 
?
Thanks Vince
?
Julie

PS - Of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people started  
responding that they wished to attend.? Ugh!

Julie,

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to  pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

I  contacted the weather desk about including other people at the  training
course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good  discount.

Great. Just to let you know,  we decided not to wait on the indecisive

day (specific to what you  feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt

Vince,

We just wanted to let you  know? that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather  derivatives course? (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple  more
that have expressed strong? interest, but we are awaiting their  final
decision. If no one else signs? up, Chris and Les thought that  you guys
could probably get through the? first day pretty easily, and  thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just? the 2nd day  material (pricing) only at
Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an?  option as well but the room might be on the
large side)? We would?  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both days  as? well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I just  wanted to give? you some time to think about it. We will know where
we  stand on final? numbers by next?  Wednesday.

Julie

Hi Vince,

I have pulled a list of names together that I would like to send some
samples of our chapters of the book too, in the next couple of days,  in
order to try and get one or two sentence "reviews" for the dust jacket of
the book. I obviously won't say anything about Enron's sponsorship until it
is official sorted out, but is it OK if I indicate that yourself and Grant
are contributing material to the book?

I'm proposing to send 5 or 6 chapters to the following - unless you have
any objections or suggestions?

David Shimko
Ehud Ronn
Helyette Geman
Mark Garman
Dragana Pilipovic
Corwin Joy
Ilia Bouchouev
Alexander Edyleland
Steve Thomas

Hope the writing is going OK, and regards to Grant.

Best regards.

Chris

Vince,

Thank you for your email.

We  will send you a copy of the book as soon as it is available, which we
are  now estimating to be around 21 November (no need to send us a cheque;
you  deserve it).

Just let us know if we should use a different address than  your office? in
Houston.

Thanks again for all of your  help.

Julie

Fiona,

To answer your questions:

1. We approved Chapter 3 for publication.

2. My current affiliation is Enron N.A. Grant left the company but my advice
it to leave his bio as is (it reflects his employment  status when he was
working on the chapter).
I don't think we should update the bio and advertise his new employer.

3. Ad material is fine.

Vinnce

Hi Shane,

Thanks for your e-mail. We actually sent the 9 of the 11 chapters off to the
typesetter today and I will forward you our word documents in the morning.

I've been travelling a lot to the UK at the moment and so haven't spent much
time with the student myself. Are you going to te energy confernece next
week, perhaps we can meet up there?

Good to hear about the weather. We are actually going to run a two day
course thru UTS on weather derivatives the first weekend of September. Feel
free to tell your potential clients about it if you think it will bring up
the industry knowledge. Maybe we can associate your name with the course
somehow which might help both of us?

C.

Julie,

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

I contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good discount.

Great.? Just to let you know, we decided not to wait on the indecisive  ones,

Vince,

We just wanted to let you know  that we only have 3 people signed up for the
weather derivatives course  (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple more
that have expressed strong  interest, but we are awaiting their final
decision. If no one else signs  up, Chris and Les thought that you guys
could probably get through the  first day pretty easily, and thus thought it
may be an option to teach just  the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an  option as well but the room might be on the
large? side)? We would  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both days as  well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I just wanted to give  you some time to think about it. We will know? where
we stand on final  numbers by next  Wednesday.

Julie

Dear Vince,

after getting our heads together here,
we would much apprecaite if you could share the Research Group's latest on 
--- 

- Var ie "... repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk..."
 as well as cover additional topics viz.
- Discuss, with application, Enrons internal V@R model, and how this is used 
internally.
- Discuss volatility modelling, and whether it is possible to maintain and 
trade a term structure of volatility in electricity

- Modelling forward curves with reference to associated markets (eg Oil). 
  Can we gain some insights through spreads to related market curves (spark).

I assume your hotel is booked already. Catching the taxi is the best way to 
get to your hotel.
Since you are arriving on the weekend , if you need to contact me - my mobile 
is 0417-692295, home tel/fax 
is 9232-8892

Paul, Raymond,

Thanks for your message. 
Sorry I did not get in touch  with you earlier. The last few weeks were very 
hectic. I am starting 
right now my preparations for the presentation I am going to give at the 
conference.

Here are the details of my itinerary (I shall send you a copy tomorrow). I 
arrive Sunday morning
and leave Saturday morning. The conference takes place on Monday and Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, I am making a presentation at the workshop on value-at-risk. I 
would
like to stay at the conference for the duration: it's a great learning 
opportunity for me.

On Thursday and Friday, as well as in the evenings (except for the evening
of July 18), I am at you disposal.
I would like to take advantage of this trip and learn as much as I can
about the Australian markets and discuss with you the research agenda.
I shall be glad to make several presentation.
I can repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk as well as cover 
additional
topics.

Dear Vince,

Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
Sydney.
Is RISK organising your hotel ?

Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
Sheraton ?

We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
when you are with us,
Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
phone etc 
so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.

How long will you be with us ?
Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.

Hear from you soon.
Raymond

Dear Vince and Grant,

Please find attached our butchering of your work (only joking...). We've
tied the chapter in with what has gone before and changed some of your
notation so that it is consistent with ours.

Vince; could you please send thru the footnotes referred to in the chapter
at your convenience. Could you also please supply a full reference for
Routledge, Seppi, Spatt (1999).

Grant; I hope you don't mind we've called PDJD just JD (to fit in more with
our work). Please also can you supply the last figure before you disappear!

Do you want us to write the summary?

Many thanks again for all your efforts. It's all looking good.

Best regards.

Chris.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

This is Quentin Kerr from Australia, I just came back from the Sydney's
conference. Glen Dixon has told me that you are interested in my work. It is
always my honor to work with you. I am currently a PhD student at the
mathsmatics department of the university of Queensland (aiming to finish my
thesis at the end of this year). My research interest is financial
mathematics, in particular, energy market modeling and derivatives pricing.
Now I send you copies of my first paper (submitted to the Applied
mathematical finance) and my talk (the full version of the academic paper
will be available in 2 weeks). Any comment will be appreciated.

PS: attached with the talk at the conference.

Best regard
Quentin

Vince,

The Sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option 
to participate in building a wind farm. Should this proceed, we would like to 
mark this option "to market".

Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and 
remarking real options? Alternatively, do you have any suggestions as to the 
best way to value, and book, real options fairly?

Regards
Paul Smith

Hi,

Attached is the draft copy of the agreement for your review.  I will call 
Lacima in London in the morning to fill in the gaps for the name of the book, 
the date they intend to publish it and the name of the person who will sign 
on their behalf.  As soon as I get your comments back, I will send the copy 
to David, our attorney, and copy you as well.

Thank you.

Chris,

I have read the paper.  It reads very well. Two comments.

1. It probably makes sense to include a note on the standard GBM simulation 
equation and
the way it's typically discretized.

2. It will help the reader who did not read the earlier articles to explain 
what CT is (perhaps a footnote).


I am also including a message I sent to Julie today.

******************************************************************************
***************
 1. I would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses (in 
Houston):

a. Paulo Issler
b. Alex Huang

I shall attend the course on weather only.  

2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5,000 AUD for Lacima.
Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2nd installment comes from the budget 
of our 
office in Australia. I shall talk to Paul Quilkey today about it. Please, let 
me know if there is any delay.

3. The book  will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at 
Rice.
Rice Univ bookshop is placing an order.

4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the best
way to place the order?  Can we pay in US dollars?

Dear Vince,

Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
Sydney.
Is RISK organising your hotel ?

Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
Sheraton ?

We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
when you are with us,
Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
phone etc 
so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.

How long will you be with us ?
Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.

Hear from you soon.
Raymond

Hi Grant,

Hope all is well with you. I trust you got my message via the voicemail
that Ileft with Vince late Friday afternoon about my inability to travel -
I'm trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week's time when my ear has
cleared up, and I look forward to meeting with you one day.

I wrote to Vince last week asking for a favour, but I'm not sure ifhe is
there in Houston. I know that you guys are probably very busy but I was
wondering if you can write a few sentences for me. I'm sending out some
sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my
request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an 'overview' of the
book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter?

I'm including what I have already written (although I think it has changed
slightly from this version) so that you can see the style.

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.



2 Overview of this Book

This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book.

In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean
reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.

Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and
Trade .

Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves.  What we do in this chapter

Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors
and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or
average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.

Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form
solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps.

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is
developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style
options.

Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a
multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are
developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo
schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of American style options.

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions.
In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also
discussed.

Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After
discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs
(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,
Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we
look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market
variables.

Julie,

There are many employees in London  who would be interested.
You can send  an inquiry to Steve Leppard. 

I had a presentation last night
to GARP in Houston and did a commercial for the book.
You should put me on commission.

Vince,
?
I wasn't sure if I responded to your email, so apologise either for my  
delayed response or repeating myself.
?
Thanks for the 2nd order!? I believe they have already been  dispatched.? 
Yes, I believe we received payment; thank you very much for  following up 
with Paul.? Glad the book was a hit!
?
On another subject, are there any Enron?employees in Europe who may be  
interested in attending either the energy or the weather course?? Or, are  
the quants and risk management mostly handled out of Houston?
?
Thanks again, and I'll forward an invoice on to Shirley.

Julie,

A few issues.

1. I would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses (in 
Houston):

a. Paulo Issler
b. Alex Huang

I shall attend the course on weather only.  

2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5,000 AUD for Lacima.
Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2nd installment comes from the budget 
of our 
office in Australia. I shall talk to Paul Quilkey today about it. Please, let 
me know if there is any delay.

3. The book  will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at 
Rice.
Rice Univ bookshop is placing an order.

4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the ebst
way to place the order?  Can we pay in US dollars?

Vince

Hi Julie:

The March Invoice #000166 was sent to our accounting department for
payment on March 28th.  I have a call into them to see what happened to
it.  I will let you know.

The AUD 5000 invoice was sent to the accounting department but they
sent it back saying they cannot pay invoices in foreign currency.  So I then
had to send it to the Treasury Dept.  I will check on it today also.

As far as the other invoice.   It should be sent to our Australia office to 
the
attention of Paul Quilkey.  We had agreed to split this with them.  Their
address is:

Paul Quilkey
Enron Australia
PTY.LTD.
Level 21
9 Castlereagh Street
Sydney, NSW 200000, 
Australia

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Shirley

Shirley,
?
Sorry to bother you again, but we still have two outstanding invoices from  
Enron.? They are:
?
March '00:????? Enron?  Inv.000166?????? USD 4900
?
September '00?? Enron  Inv.000202??????? AUD 5000

I have  another invoice to send out for the balance of?the original AUD 
10,000  (balance would be the remaining AUD 5,000), but?I'm?unsure to whom I  
should direct it?? I sent?an email to Vince several weeks ago asking  for 
this information, but haven't heard (assume he's tremendously busy).
?
Let me know what you?need from?me.
?
Thanks,
Julie

Oh.? I sent an invoice to Habiba for AUS 5K a while back, and she  informed 
me that she passed it along to the people who are handling the  agreement now 
(I take that as Fiona Grant in London?).? I will then send  out another 
invoice of AUS 5K in the next week or so for the remaining  balance.? Should 
I have sent the invoice to you?

Thank you for your email.

We  will send you a copy of the book as soon as it is available, which we
are  now estimating to be around 21 November (no need to send us a cheque;
you  deserve it).

Just let us know if we should use a different address than  your office? in

Thanks again for all of your  help.

Fiona,
?
Thanks for your message and the update.? We haven't made  any changes.? I was 
referring to the Enron changes, and the electronic  brochure I sent to you 
yesterday.? In total, we have the following pieces  which list the Enron name:
?
-? Book cover
-? Bios which are on the cover and in the "Preface"  section of the book
-? Chapter 3 which was written by Vince Kaminski's  group
-? Electronic brochure
?
The first 3 pieces are the most important since they have to  do with the 
printing of the book.? If you could?get the modifications  to us by Thursday, 
that would be great.? 
?
Thanks, and look forward to hearing from you.
?
Julie

Grant,

Sorry for the silence. It's definately not a commentary on your work - I've
been travelling back and forward between Sydney and London like a yo-yo and
trying to tidy up things on our end. I've been working on incoporating your
material and will spend all of tomorrow on this (hopefully!) so that I can
ask for the last few amendments before the w/end.

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.

Hi Vince,

It was good to speak to you and Grant the other day.  Plese find attached a
block of 3 chapters that are basically the middle of the book. This should
give you an idea at the level it is pitched - although these are probably
some of the the most technical of the chapters. Julie who works for us will
be getting in contact with you soon to chase you up on your chapter!

I've asked Julie to have a chat to you about a couple of other things at
the same time. I hope this is OK with you. Julie and I will be making a
trip thru Houston around the third week of February to try and visit some
energy companies. It's mainly a fact finding trip to see what the energy
companies are doing and how we might be able to make use of our skills in a
commercial sense. Would you recommend any people we should talk too? Also
we will be running a course on energy derivatives in Houston at the end of
March following the success of the course in New York last year and want to
advertise this. Do you know of people who would be interested in such a
course?

We are currently putting together promotional material for the book - can
you please let Julie know how you and Grant would like to be advertised -
your official positions, etc.

Best regards, and I look forward to reading your chapter soon.

Chris.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

I am sorry I missed your phone call today. I was waiting for your call until
7:50 am (Australia time) this morning. My mother-in-law told me you ringed
me at 8:05. I guess we made a mistake at the time difference. I promise I
won't leave home tomorrow until I receive your call.

Your faithfully
Quentin

Thank you very much Sir. I'll incorporate you comments later today and send
it off.

Thanks also for your other comments, I'm glad you regard the book highly
enough for your group and your course.

I look forward to catching up with you soon.

Best regards.

Dear Vince,

Thanks for attending the energy derivatives course, and I hope you found it 
valuable.

There's been some interest from other course attendees to put together a 
contact list and distribute it to one another.  I'm contacting you to see if 
you or Zimin Lu have any objection to being included on the list.  We will 
include only details that you approve, such as name, company name, address 
and email if you wish.

We would like to send out the list early next week, so please let us know.

Thanks,
Julie

Dear Vince,

after getting our heads together here,
we would much apprecaite if you could share the Research Group's latest on 
--- 

- Var ie "... repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk..."
 as well as cover additional topics viz.
- Discuss, with application, Enrons internal V@R model, and how this is used 
internally.
- Discuss volatility modelling, and whether it is possible to maintain and 
trade a term structure of volatility in electricity

- Modelling forward curves with reference to associated markets (eg Oil). 
  Can we gain some insights through spreads to related market curves (spark).

I assume your hotel is booked already. Catching the taxi is the best way to 
get to your hotel.
Since you are arriving on the weekend , if you need to contact me - my mobile 
is 0417-692295, home tel/fax 
is 9232-8892

Paul, Raymond,

Thanks for your message. 
Sorry I did not get in touch  with you earlier. The last few weeks were very 
hectic. I am starting 
right now my preparations for the presentation I am going to give at the 
conference.

Here are the details of my itinerary (I shall send you a copy tomorrow). I 
arrive Sunday morning
and leave Saturday morning. The conference takes place on Monday and Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, I am making a presentation at the workshop on value-at-risk. I 
would
like to stay at the conference for the duration: it's a great learning 
opportunity for me.

On Thursday and Friday, as well as in the evenings (except for the evening
of July 18), I am at you disposal.
I would like to take advantage of this trip and learn as much as I can
about the Australian markets and discuss with you the research agenda.
I shall be glad to make several presentation.
I can repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk as well as cover 
additional
topics.

Dear Vince,

Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
Sydney.
Is RISK organising your hotel ?

Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
Sheraton ?

We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
when you are with us,
Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
phone etc 
so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.

How long will you be with us ?
Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.

Hear from you soon.
Raymond

Vince,
Enron is fine (although I think we have to pay for the Hyatt anyway).
?
Good discount (I have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the  
weather desk's idea is probably different?):? for the one day, $1100 per  
person.? If you think that there will be?around 10 people or more,  then we 
can offer a day rate, regardless of the number of people.? 
?
Thanks Vince
?

PS - Of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people started  
responding that they wished to attend.? Ugh!

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to  pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

I  contacted the weather desk about including other people at the  training
course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good  discount.

Vince,

Great. Just to let you know,  we decided not to wait on the indecisive
ones, and postponed the open  course. It's yours, whatever you want: ? 1
day (specific to what you  feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt
or? Enron, or not at  all. I hope this doesn't cause problems for you.
Special deal, for sure. I  owe my godfather.

Julie

Julie,

That's definitely an option.

We  can? provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal  for
Enron
and? increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding  your message to
our? weather  desk.

Vince

Joe,

What do you think about?  it?

Vince,

We just wanted to let you  know? that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather  derivatives course? (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple  more
that have expressed strong? interest, but we are awaiting their  final
decision. If no one else signs? up, Chris and Les thought that  you guys
could probably get through the? first day pretty easily, and  thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just? the 2nd day  material (pricing) only at
Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an?  option as well but the room might be on the
large side)? We would?  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both days  as? well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I just  wanted to give? you some time to think about it. We will know where
we  stand on final? numbers by next?  Wednesday.

Julie

Hi Vince,

Hope all is well with you. I'm looking forward to seeing you again next
week and meeting with Grant. Can you guys do me  favour? I'm sending out
some sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!)
to my request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an 'overview' of
the book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter?

I'm including what I have already written so that you can see the style.

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.



2 Overview of this Book

This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book.

In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean
reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.

Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson of Enron Capital and
Trade .

Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves.  What we do in this chapter

Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors
and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or
average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.

Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form
solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps.

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is
developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style
options.

Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a
multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are
developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo
schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of American style options.

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions.
In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also
discussed.

Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After
discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs
(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,
Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we
look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market
variables.

Finally, we finish with credit risk in energy markets in chapter 11.

Mark,

Over the past several months Vince and Paul have had some contact with the 
authors of this upcoming risk management book.  Vince and his group are 
writing a chapter and the forward, and Enron Australia will contribute 
AUS$10,000 in support of the book.  There are a number of apparent legal 
issues associated with completing/publicizing this book and Marge suggested 
that this is an area of interest to you.  I handle public relations for 
APACHI and will try to contact you within the next couple of days to seek 
your guidance.

Thanks,

John

Hi John,

Nice talking with you last week.

The following are some of the items that we discussed during own phone
call:

-  attached is a copy of the introduction of the book.  section 1.2
provides a content overview 
-  we are planning to market the book globally, and feel the market size 
is
around 3000
-  the authors names are Dr Chris Stickland and Dr Les Clewlow 

-  Mini bio of authors:  Dr. Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland hold
Associate Research Positions at both the School of Finance and Economics,
University of Technology, Sydney and the Financial Options Research Centre,
University of Warwick, UK.  Together, they have over 20 years combined
experience in the financial and energy derivative markets and have
published many articles in academic and trade journals.  They are the
authors of the book "Implementing Derivatives Models" (Wiley, 1998) and
editors of "Exotic Options: The State of the Art" (ITP, 1998).  Their
forthcoming book "Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management" is due
to be published during the second quarter 2000.  Currently, their interests
are concentrated in the energy derivatives area, where they have developed
a wide range of pricing tools for electricity options and other energy
derivatives.


Could you please provide responses to the following:
-  Would it be OK if we use the logo for Enron, the global company?
-  What will you need from us before printing?  If you need to review the
book jacket or the manuscript, please let us know.
-  If Enron needs to review anything, how long will it take for Enron to
turn it around?
-  We are putting together a leaflet advertising our energy course.  We
would like to mention the forthcoming book and that it is being sponsored
by Enron...is this OK with you?  No logo will be used.
-  We would like to produce a leaflet / brochure advertising the book as
well, but this will follow after we have the book cover designed.  Should I
work with Andrew at Stokes Account Ex. on this? 
-  How do we handle the money side of things?  


The manuscript is not fully completed, but we may begin typesetting any day
now.  I think it will take about 3-4 weeks to typeset and then another 3
weeks to print and bind.  Sometime in late April?
It looks like we will be in Houston around the 7th of March...will you be
around either the 7th or 8th?

I hope you are enjoying your time at home.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Take care,
Julie

Dear Vince,

Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
Sydney.
Is RISK organising your hotel ?

Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
Sheraton ?

We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
when you are with us,
Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
phone etc 
so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.

How long will you be with us ?
Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.

Hear from you soon.
Raymond

Good morning Quentin:

Vince Kaminski and the Research Group would like to conduct a telephone
interview with you sometime next week.  Considering the time difference 
between
Houston and Australia, it probably makes sense to try and schedule it very
early in the morning your time, say 7:00 AM?  It would be 5:00 pm here in
Houston.

How does next Wednesday or Thursday, (8/16 or 8/17) at 7:00 AM your time
sound?

Also, please let me know if you want to be reached at home or work.

Thanks Quentin and have a great day!

Dear Vince,

1.
Quentin Kerr, 
we will be pleased to do the initial due diligence in an interview. Phil 
Taylor is contacting Quentin and getting him down our Sydney office from his 
university in the next state - Queensland.


2.
re : Christian,
We will be very glad for Christain to interact with Houston research on ".. 
the weather forecasting  technology .."
However, we are very skinny on W staff here ( like Christian is our one & 
only ) , and Christian is doing much work for both the power & weather 
business.

I was thinking that we could run with our initial idea of having Mike Roberts 
come to Sydney. 
There is still time before the Olympics !


Will keep you posted on Quentin.

Regards
Raymond

Subject: Thank you

Paul & Raymond,

It took more than a few days to catch up after I came back from Australia. 
There  are few things I would like to bring up to your attention.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot
about the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the
quality of the people at the Sydney office.

1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.
I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview.

2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.
Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? 
The main determination I need from you is whether he can
function in a company like Enron. As any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case
you don't have a PostScript reader on your system.

3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on
the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike 
Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic? I think that he could learn a lot
from Mike and other weather guys here how we translate 
weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad to
underwrite the cost of this trip.

Vince

Dear Vince/Grant,

It was good to meet and talk with you both this morning - very interesting.
Here are the details of the course (actually there are two seperate
courses, one on VaR) that I promised you.

I hope to see you both again later in the month.

Best regards.
Chris.




COURSE 1:   Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-

Course Leaders: Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland

Houston: 29-30 March 2000
London:  3-4 April 2000

Fee : STG 1950 / USD 2950

This is an intermediate course aimed at the Energy professional who is
familiar with energy derivative products but who requires the mathematical
foundations of derivative pricing and an understanding of the pricing and
risk management of energy derivatives.

This course assumes that participants are familiar with standard basic
option pricing theory (the Black-Scholes formula, Monte Carlo simulation,
and the use of binomial trees for option pricing).

The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and
successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and Excel based computer
workshops. To facilitate intensive interaction, the course will be limited
to a maximum of 15 participants so early booking is advisable.

The Excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as
electricity derivatives and contain detailed calculations for pricing and
risk management. At the end of the 2 days, participants leave with a
diskette containing answers to all the workshops as well as valuable code
for pricing and simulation.

Registration fee includes: pre-course reading, course materials, copies of
relevant research materials, diskette with fully worked solutions to
computer workshops, lunch and refreshments.  Additionally, each attendee
will receive a free copy of Clewlow and Strickland's forthcoming book
"Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management" which includes
valuable contributions from Enron's Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson.

Upon registration, participants will be sent a pack containing relevant
pre-course reading.

Chris,

My part has not changed for some time (since early July).

I sent  the last vintage of corrections  to you when I was in Sydney.
You can send the version you consider final to us just to double check.

I took the liberty of sending our chapter to Darrell Duffie and he liked it.
What is more important he did not find any error.


I shell send you my comments on the article for Robin in a day or so.

How are things with you? Well I hope. Do you have  the latest version of your 
part of chapter 3? (I think GRant has sent thru a  seperate, updated version 
to you, which has been typeset). Everything else has  been tied up and we 
will go with the version we have, unless we hear  otherwise.

Gentlemen,

Thankyou for your fine effort. I'll e-mail thru Thurs eve (Sydney time) what
we have done to incorporate it into our material (which wasn't toooo
painful) to see if it is OK with you. A couple of quick questions though.

Vince - your section had a number of footnote numbers, but no actual
footnotes - can you please resend them?

Grant - I agree it would be good to have the final figure. What happens if
you plot the historical data and the simulations on the same graph - but
with different axis?

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.

Subject: Outage Tracker Option And Background


Vince,

To follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious 
plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage.

The system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best 
option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along 
with relative network performance from a few points.

I am currently chasing NEMMCO (AU system operator) to get hold of a few weeks 
of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough 
measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas.

The idea follows along the lines (literally !) that when a unit fails it will 
introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency, which is then 
reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators. The drop 
in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may 
change the phase shift across the whole grid. The phase shift across the 
network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion 
devices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct.

The second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker 
is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will 
cause an RF pulse that should propogate across some of the network. 
Transformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many 
miles away from the fault location. Measure the arrival time at several point 
on the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. Part of the 
solution is already proven in lightning trackers. The solution may be made 
more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed 
(i.e. measuring the three phases at 1MHz and then sending the data through a 
DSP). This solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure 
to be pinpointed to a station. The timing base for each of the nodes may be 
sourced from GPS timing, self locating at the same time !

Will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups.


Karl.

On  another subject, are there any Enron employees in Europe who may  be

Grant,

Thanks for that. I hope you had a good holiday - we were all very jealous of
you at dinner the other evening.

I made some changes for it to fit in with our notation, etc, but apart from
that its a fin piece of work. If you could just answer the questions posed
by Vince, and send me the final figure then we are a go (all of ours are now
finished). Would you be happy with the following?

3.5 Summary

In this chapter we have discussed volatility modelling and estimation in the
energy commodity markets, emphasising the difference between this market and
financial markets.  We discuss the estimation of volatility from both
historical and implied data, again from the perspective of the energy user.
We further discussed a number of stochastic volatility models and have shown
how to estimate the models via ordinary least squares and maximum
likelihood.  We have tested our estimation techniques on a number of
examples drawn from energy markets including electricity, gas and crude oil.

Best regards.

Chris.

Chris,

This is very well written and will serve the reader well. A few comments.

1. When I think about the taxonomy of the VaR models, I typically use the 
classification based on 3 categories:

 a. variance/covariance  method
                b. historical simulation
                c. Monte Carlo simulation.

Delta approach is the way of representing a position in a nonlinear 
instrument.

2. I would define Monte Carlo as an approach based on statistical simulation 
of behavior of
all the market prices/rates, etc., and revaluation of the entire portfolio.
The revaluation may be based on an approximation (using Taylor's expansion) 
that may
 involve delta, delta/gamma, delta/gamma/omega or may be exact (based on the 
same
model that produces the mark-to-market portfolio valuations).

The main benefit of using the  MC simulation in the energy markets is the 
ability to capture
the gapping behavior of the energy markets in a straightforward way. I would 
emphasize that
there are attempts to incorporate jumps in the V/C model (I shall send you 
the references 
from home).

3. I would mention that historical simulation may break down in the markets 
that are evolving
quickly (new instruments for which we have no comparable prices,
behavior of prices may change as markets mature or de-mature).

4. For bigger portfolios, virtually all methods require some level of 
aggregation into
 atomic, elemental instruments to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
This process may be a source of a big error.

5. The computational burden of MC can be reduced through clever preprocessing
of a portfolio that introduces no error. Many swaps with the same underlying
can be aggregated into one positions ( they are  portfolios of forwards and 
they are linear
instruments).

Please, feel free to use any comment (or none).

Vince

Paul, Raymond,

Thanks for your message. 
Sorry I did not get in touch  with you earlier. The last few weeks were very 
hectic. I am starting 
right now my preparations for the presentation I am going to give at the 
conference.

Here are the details of my itinerary (I shall send you a copy tomorrow). I 
arrive Sunday morning
and leave Saturday morning. The conference takes place on Monday and Tuesday. 
On Wednesday, I am making a presentation at the workshop on value-at-risk. I 
would
like to stay at the conference for the duration: it's a great learning 
opportunity for me.

On Thursday and Friday, as well as in the evenings (except for the evening
of July 18), I am at you disposal.
I would like to take advantage of this trip and learn as much as I can
about the Australian markets and discuss with you the research agenda.
I shall be glad to make several presentation.
I can repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk as well as cover 
additional
topics. 


Vince

Dear Vince,

Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
Sydney.
Is RISK organising your hotel ?

Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
Sheraton ?

We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
when you are with us,
Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
phone etc 
so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.

How long will you be with us ?
Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.

Hear from you soon.
Raymond

Hi Grant,

Hope all is well with you. I trust you got my message via the voicemail
that Ileft with Vince late Friday afternoon about my inability to travel -
I'm trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week's time when my ear has
cleared up, and I look forward to meeting with you one day.

I wrote to Vince last week asking for a favour, but I'm not sure ifhe is
there in Houston. I know that you guys are probably very busy but I was
wondering if you can write a few sentences for me. I'm sending out some
sample chapters to the people who responded positively (all of them!) to my
request for some feedback on the book. Chapter 1 has an 'overview' of the
book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter. Could you please
write a sentence or two for your chapter?

I'm including what I have already written (although I think it has changed
slightly from this version) so that you can see the style.

Many thanks and best regards.

Chris.



2 Overview of this Book

This book aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the pricing and risk
management of energy derivatives.  In the remainder of this chapter we give
an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy
assets, and which underlie the rest of the book.  As well as introducing
the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes modelling framework we
discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and Monte Carlo
simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the
book.

In Chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices.  Apart from describing
empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model
the prices. We look at the well-know process of GBM as well as mean
reversion, stochastic volatility and jump processes, discussing each, and
showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated.

Chapter 3, written by Vince Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of 
Enron Corporation, discusses volatility estimation in energy commodity 
markets. This chapter builds on the previous one.  It examines in detail
the methods, merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process 
assuming different pricing models introduced in chapter 2.  Examples 
from crude, gas, and electricity markets are used to illustrate the 
technical and interpretative aspects of calculating volatility.

Chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets.  Although such
curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets
the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined
curves.  What we do in this chapter

Chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not-so-common derivative
structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses.  Examples of
products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors
and collars, as well as energy swaptions, compound options, Asian (or
average rate) options, Barriers, lookbacks, and ladder options.

Chapter 6 investigates single and multi-factor models of the energy spot
price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives.  Closed form
solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option
prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter
including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate
model with jumps.

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and American style options
can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6.  Simulation schemes are
developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a
variety of path dependent options.  In order to price options which
incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial tree scheme is
developed.  This tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward
curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard American style
options.

Chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on
modelling the market observed forward curve.  The approach results in a
multi-factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a
wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility
structures can be of an extremely general form.  Closed-form solutions are
developed for pricing standard European options and efficient Monte Carlo
schemes for exotic options.  The chapter finishes with a discussion of the
valuation of American style options.

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions.
In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions
that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced
with the problem of managing the risk through time.  We begin with delta
hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma
hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7.  The general model of
chapter 7 ideally suited to multi-factor hedging and this is also
discussed.

Chapter 10 looks at the key risk-management concept of Value at Risk
applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios.  After
discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs
(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.  We then
compare the fours major methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,
Delta-gamma, historical simulation and Monte-Carlo simulation.  Finally, we
look at testing the VaR estimates for various underlying energy market
variables.

I'm sorry you weren't around in Sydney this week.  You missed a very good 
book launch party that John Martin organised here for us.  Paul made a short 
speech in which he relayed some great comments which he said  came from?you - 
thanks very much!

Please find attached the next EPRM article. Its not  really tided up fully 
from our end yet, but I wanted to send it off before the  weekend in case you 
got chance to look at it. Because of the Easter break Robin  is after it by 
Thursday of next week.

Dear Vince,

It was our privilege to have you here.
Paul's wife had a baby yesterday, and Paul  will be back on Thursday. So 
maybe item 3 can wait until Paul's return.

As for (2), yes - i will need a PS reader :o)
Again, let us check Paul's diary on his return before fixing a time for 
Quentin Kerr

1 1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.
I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview.

Is this Simon ???

Thanks

Subject: Thank you

Paul & Raymond,

It took more than a few days to catch up after I came back from Australia. 
There  are few things I would like to bring up to your attention.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot
about the Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the
quality of the people at the Sydney office.

1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.
I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help
you with a phone interview.

2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over
to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.
Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? 
The main determination I need from you is whether he can
function in a company like Enron. As any good academic
he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case
you don't have a PostScript reader on your system.

3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on
the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help
us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike 
Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic? I think that he could learn a lot
from Mike and other weather guys here how we translate 
weather info into business-related information. I shall be glad to
underwrite the cost of this trip.

Vince

Chris,

Thanks for the invitation. I shall be glad to meet you and your family in 
Sydney at your home.

I am enclosing the draft of my part of the chapter. It's more than 
preliminary  but I hope
to improve it greatly over the weekend. I shall forward you a new version on 
Sunday evening
my time. Grant is moving along on his part. I  hope it reduces the penalty to 
broken knee-caps.

I shall send you a longer message from home to give you an update on my 
conversations
with EPRM  regarding the articles.

Just a friendly reminder that the hired guns are  making their way up to

I was reading the promotional material for the EPRM  conference here in July. 
I wanted to invite you to dinner at my apartment on the  evening between the

I read the chapter. Generally,
I like it, and find it non-controversial
and well written. Of course, this is
a huge topic and there are things
that you haven't discussed.

I thought the amount of attention
paid to OLS and MLE estimation
was a bit overboard, given that you
didn't really exploit it in your
results. If you were to state
the likelihood function for
the GARCH model, it might justify
the amount of attention to
gave to estimation for
simple iid processes, which could then
be thought of as a simple lead-in
and intuition builder to
the more interesting models that
you do actually use.

By the way, in your discussion of
smiles, you discuss fat tails
extensively. At least for equity markets,
while fat tails contribute, they don't do very
much at all compared to the effect
of risk premia, which you allude to briefly,
using supply-demand language, at the
end of that section.

For the impact of risk premia, see
Jun Pan's paper, which is available
from her web page. But she covers
only SP500, (as do most studies),
and your markets are obviously much different.

The chapter will be a good service to your readers!

Best, Darrell

Hi Vince,

I have pulled a list of names together that I would like to send some
samples of our chapters of the book too, in the next couple of days,  in
order to try and get one or two sentence "reviews" for the dust jacket of
the book. I obviously won't say anything about Enron's sponsorship until it
is official sorted out, but is it OK if I indicate that yourself and Grant
are contributing material to the book?

I'm proposing to send 5 or 6 chapters to the following - unless you have
any objections or suggestions?

David Shimko
Ehud Ronn
Helyette Geman
Mark Garman
Dragana Pilipovic
Corwin Joy
Ilia Bouchouev
Alexander Edyleland
Steve Thomas

Hope the writing is going OK, and regards to Grant.

Best regards.

Chris

Vince,

That's good news. Anything you need from me please feel free to ask - if we
can get the ball rolling soon we can time things well with the publication
of the book (my diary says that there are 2 weeks until the contract goes
out on you and Grant...).

Best regards.

Chris.

Dear Vince,

Thanks for your phone call this morning. I will ring Mike tonight, i.e. 
Houston tomorrow morning. 

....had a look at the temps and anomalies over CA, looks warm for this time 
of the year (Dec.), there has been an increase in the night time 
T_min, and T_max remains at an above average level. 

I will start setting up my models over CONUS this week. 


Regards,
Christian

Vince,
?
We just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the  
weather derivatives course (all from Enron) so far.? We have a couple more  
that have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final  
decision.? If no one else signs up, Chris and Les thought that you guys  
could probably get through the first day pretty easily,?and thus thought it  
may be an option to teach just the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron  
(doing it at the Hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the 
large  side)?? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught.? We  
can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.?  
?
I just wanted to give you some time to think about it.? We will know  where 
we stand on final numbers by next Wednesday.
?
Julie

We happened upon this fellow through Strickland.  What are your thoughts on 
the background?  We are still working to formulate our requirements in the 
office but consider this person worth talking to.

Julie:

Unfortunately, our reviewer has not come back to us with comments, so I am 
sending you the final version without the benefit of review.
The attached zipped file contains the second half of the chapter for which I 
was responsible.  Vince will send you his half separately.  Putting them 
together should be a simple matter of cut and paste, assuming that Vince has 
not changed his equation, figure, or table numbering. 

 I presume Chris will be reading through the chapter once again for editorial 
reasons. There is one place where I would ask him for specific redaction:  
Table 3.6 "Model specifications" on page 14/15 has a column labeled "Equation 
Reference".  Some cells are blank because the equations specified have not 
been referenced previously in the parts I have written.  Nevertheless, the 
concepts are surely introduced elsewhere in the book, and it may be helpful 
for Chris to insert the appropriate reference in this table.  Alternatively, 
one could simply delete the column. 

If I can help in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Chris,

Thanks for the invitation. The evening of July the 18th is fine  with me.

The list looks fine and it can be easily expanded, if the first set of
articles is well received. I shall prepare a list of topics that occupy us
every day and that we could write about without revealing the details of our
proprietary research.

Please, feel free to send the message from Lacima. I think that it's better
for us to sign the articles with our names, giving our respective
affiliations. In this way, Enron gets the credit, but not the liability if
there is any error in an article.

Hope to see you soon.

Vince

Julie,

Sorry for the delay. Here are he comments.

Vince

************************************

Sorry for long delay in responding. I have a few comments. Most are focused
on the third article as here is till time to make modifications.

1.  In the second article, I would mention that the formulation of the mean
reversion process represents one of several possible equations that capture
the same type of market evolution of prices over time.
2.  One comment that applies to both articles. The problem is how one defines
the time series of energy prices. The numbers used for Australian NSW pool
prices seem to correspond to chronological prices. One alternative approach
is to build different time series for the corresponding time intervals for
each day. This would result in different price behavior and estimates of
jump. The choice is one of convenience and depends on actual problem under
investigation. One could argue that volumes of electricity traded during
different time slots represent different economic commodities.
Figure 3a (Jump Frequency) has units on the vertical axis that require
explanation. Are we talking about an expected number of jumps in the total
number of half hourly periods in a year? The same goes for f in Table 2
(article number 3).

Dear Dr. Kaminski

This is Quentin Kerr from Australia, I just came back from the Sydney's
conference. Glen Dixon has told me that you are interested in my work. It is
always my honor to work with you. I am currently a PhD student at the
mathsmatics department of the university of Queensland (aiming to finish my
thesis at the end of this year). My research interest is financial
mathematics, in particular, energy market modeling and derivatives pricing.
Now I send you copies of my first paper (submitted to the Applied
mathematical finance) and my talk (the full version of the academic paper
will be available in 2 weeks). Any comment will be appreciated.

PS: attached with the talk at the conference.

Best regard
Quentin

Preface

?

?

?

One of our main objectives in  writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk=
=20
Management has been to bring  together as many of the various approaches fo=
r=20
the pricing and risk management  energy derivatives as possible, to discuss=
=20
in-depth the models, and to show how  they relate to each other.? In this =
=20
way we hope to help the reader to analyse the different models, price a wid=
e =20
range of energy derivatives, or to build a risk management system which use=
s=20
a  consistent modelling framework.? We  believe that for practitioners this=
=20
last point is very important and we continue  to stress in our articles and=
=20
presentations the dangers of having flawed risk  management and giving=20
arbitrage opportunities to your competitors by using  ad-hoc and inconsiste=
nt=20
models for different instruments and markets (see also OTHERS WHO PROPOSE=
=20
CONSISTENT  MODELS?).? However, it is not  our wish to concentrate on one=
=20
particular model or models, at the exclusion of  the others because we=20
believe that the choice should rest with the user  (although it will probab=
ly=20
be clear from our discussions the model(s) we  prefer).? We therefore try a=
nd=20
give  as clear account as possible of the advantage and disadvantages of al=
l=20
the  models so that the reader can make an informed choice as to the models=
=20
which  best suit their needs.

?

In order to meet our objectives the  book is divided into 11 chapters.?  In=
=20
chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to  mode=
l=20
and price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the  book=
.?=20
In addition to introducing  the techniques that underlie the Black-Scholes=
=20
modelling framework we outline  the numerical techniques of trinomial trees=
=20
and Monte Carlo simulation for  derivative pricing, which are used througho=
ut=20
the book.

?

In Chapter 2 we discuss the  analysis of spot energy prices.? As  well as=
=20
analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes  that=
=20
can be used to model the prices.?  We look at the well-know process of=20
Geometric Brownian Motion as well as  mean reversion, stochastic volatility=
=20
and jump processes, discussing each and  showing how they can be simulated=
=20
and their parameters estimated.

?

Chapter 3, written by Vince  Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of=20
Enron Corp., discusses volatility  estimation in energy commodity markets.?=
 =20
This chapter builds on the previous one.? It examines in detail the methods=
, =20
merits and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different=
 =20
pricing models introduced in chapter 2.?  Examples from crude, gas, and=20
electricity markets are used to illustrate  the technical and interpretativ=
e=20
aspects of calculating volatility.

?

Chapter 4 examines forward curves  in the energy markets.? Although  such=
=20
curves are well understood and straight-forward in the most financial =20
markets, the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less wel=
l =20
defined curves.? In this chapter we  describe forward price bounds for ener=
gy=20
prices and the building of forward  curves from market instruments.? We =20
outline the three main approaches which have been applied to building=20
forward  curves in energy markets; the arbitrage approach, the econometric=
=20
approach, and  deriving analytical values by modelling underlying stochasti=
c=20
factors.

?

Chapter 5 presents an overview of  structures found in the energy derivativ=
e=20
markets and discusses their uses.? Examples of products analysed in this =
=20
chapter include a variety of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as=20
energy  swaptions, compound options, Asian options, barrier options, lookba=
ck=20
options,  and ladder options.

?

Chapter 6 investigates single and  multi-factor models of the energy spot=
=20
price and the pricing of some standard  energy derivatives.? Closed form =
=20
solutions for forward prices, forward volatilities, and European option=20
prices  both on the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the=
=20
models in  this chapter including a three factor, stochastic convenience=20
yield and interest  rate model.

?

Chapter 7 shows how the prices of  path dependent and American style option=
s=20
can be evaluated for the models in  Chapter 6.? Simulation schemes are =20
developed for the evaluation of European style options and applied to a=20
variety  of path dependent options.? In order  to price options which=20
incorporate early exercise opportunities, a trinomial  tree scheme is=20
developed.? This tree  is built to be consistent with the observed forward=
=20
curve and can be used to  price exotic as well as standard European and=20
American style options.

?

Chapter 8 describes a methodology  for valuing energy options based on=20
modelling the whole of the market observed  forward curve.? The approach=20
results  in a multi-factor model that is able to realistically capture the=
=20
evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves.?  The user defined=20
volatility structures can be of an extremely general  form.? Closed-form=20
solutions are  developed for pricing standard European options, and efficie=
nt=20
Monte Carlo  schemes are presented for pricing exotic options.? The chapter=
=20
closes with a discussion of  the valuation of American style options.

?

Chapter 9 focuses on the risk  management of energy derivative positions.? =
=20
In this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions =
=20
that trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the=20
problem  of managing the risk through time.?  We begin with delta hedging a=
=20
portfolio containing derivatives and look  at extensions to gamma hedging =
=01)=20
illustrating the techniques using both spot and  forward curve models.? The=
=20
general  model presented in Chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi-factor=20
hedging of a  portfolio of energy derivatives and this is also discussed.

?

Chapter 10 examines the key risk  management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)=
=20
applied to portfolios containing  energy derivative products.? After =20
discussing the concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs =20
(volatilities, covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated.? We then=
=20
compare the fours major  methodologies for computing VaR; Delta, Delta-gamm=
a,=20
historical simulation and  Monte-Carlo simulation, applying each to the sam=
e=20
portfolio of energy  options.? In this chapter we also  look at testing the=
=20
VaR estimates for various underlying energy market  variables.

?

Finally, in Chapter 11 we review  modelling approaches to credit risk.?  We=
=20
look in detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morg=
an=20
(1997)) and  CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial  Products (1997)) for whi=
ch=20
detailed information is publicly available.? Together these provide an=20
extensive set  of tools with which to measure credit risk.? We present=20
numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives.

?
Before  we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this=
=20
book are tools  which should be used with the benefit of an understanding o=
f=20
how both the =01+tool=01,  and the market works.? The  techniques we descri=
be are=20
certainly not =01&magic wands=018 which can be waved at  data and risk mana=

Paul,

Krishna and I are thinking that you may be able to book this type of option 
as a call swaption on power.   If you would like to discuss further, let's 
set up a time when we can call you.

Vince,

The Sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option 
to participate in building a wind farm. Should this proceed, we would like to 
mark this option "to market".

Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and 
remarking real options? Alternatively, do you have any suggestions as to the 
best way to value, and book, real options fairly?

Vince,

Hope you are well.

We  spoke a while ago about who should write the preface for the book, and?  
you
kindly offered that you would provide this. Is this still?  possible? We
realise that you are extremely busy, so Chris and Les  went? ahead and wrote
something, which is below, and if you want to  review, change or? re-write the
preface, that would be very  appreciated. Let me know? what your thoughts  
are.

Thanks,
Julie
(we're getting  close)



Preface







One of our main  objectives in? writing Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk
Management  has been to bring? together as many of the various approaches 
for  the
pricing and risk management? energy derivatives as possible, to  discuss 
in-depth
the models, and to show how? they relate to each  other. In this? way we hope 
to
help the reader to analyse the  different models, price a wide? range of 
energy
derivatives, or to  build a risk management system which uses a? consistent
modelling  framework. We? believe that for practitioners this last point is  
very
important and we continue? to stress in our articles and  presentations the
dangers of having flawed risk? management and giving  arbitrage opportunities 
to
your competitors by using? ad-hoc and  inconsistent models for different
instruments and markets (see also OTHERS  WHO PROPOSE CONSISTENT? MODELS?).
However, it is not? our wish to  concentrate on one particular model or 
models,
at the exclusion of?  the others because we believe that the choice should 
rest
with the  user? (although it will probably be clear from our discussions  the
model(s) we? prefer). We therefore try and give? as clear  account as possible
of the advantage and disadvantages of all the?  models so that the reader can
make an informed choice as to the models  which? best suit their needs.



In order to meet our  objectives the? book is divided into 11 chapters. ? In
chapter 1  we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to? 
model  and
price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the?  book. In
addition to introducing? the techniques that underlie the  Black-Scholes
modelling framework we outline? the numerical techniques  of trinomial trees 
and
Monte Carlo simulation for? derivative pricing,  which are used throughout the
book.



In Chapter 2 we discuss  the? analysis of spot energy prices. As? well as
analysing  empirical price movements we propose a number of processes? that  
can
be used to model the prices. ? We look at the well-know process of  Geometric
Brownian Motion as well as? mean reversion, stochastic  volatility and jump
processes, discussing each and? showing how they  can be simulated and their
parameters estimated.



Chapter 3,  written by Vince? Kaminski, Grant Masson and Ronnie Chahal of  
Enron
Corp., discusses volatility? estimation in energy commodity  markets. ? This
chapter builds on the previous one. It examines in  detail the methods,? 
merits
and pitfalls of the volatility estimation  process assuming different? pricing
models introduced in chapter 2.  ? Examples from crude, gas, and electricity
markets are used to  illustrate? the technical and interpretative aspects of
calculating  volatility.



Chapter 4 examines forward curves? in the  energy markets. Although? such 
curves
are well understood and  straight-forward in the most financial? markets, the
difficulty of  storage in many energy markets leads to less well? defined 
curves.
In  this chapter we? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and  the
building of forward? curves from market instruments. We?  outline the three 
main
approaches which have been applied to building  forward? curves in energy
markets; the arbitrage approach, the  econometric approach, and? deriving
analytical values by modelling  underlying stochastic factors.



Chapter 5 presents an overview  of? structures found in the energy derivative
markets and discusses  their uses. Examples of products analysed in this
chapter include a variety  of swaps, caps, floors and collars, as well as 
energy
swaptions, compound  options, Asian options, barrier options, lookback 
options,
and ladder  options.



Chapter 6 investigates single and? multi-factor  models of the energy spot 
price
and the pricing of some standard?  energy derivatives. Closed form? solutions
for forward prices, forward  volatilities, and European option prices? both on
the spot and  forwards are derived and presented for all the models in? this
chapter  including a three factor, stochastic convenience yield and interest
rate  model.



Chapter 7 shows how the prices of? path dependent  and American style options 
can
be evaluated for the models in? Chapter  6. Simulation schemes are? developed
for the evaluation of European  style options and applied to a variety? of 
path
dependent options. In  order? to price options which incorporate early  
exercise
opportunities, a trinomial? tree scheme is developed. This  tree? is built to 
be
consistent with the observed forward curve and  can be used to? price exotic 
as
well as standard European and American  style options.



Chapter 8 describes a methodology? for  valuing energy options based on 
modelling
the whole of the market  observed? forward curve. The approach results? in a
multi-factor  model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a
wide range  of energy forward curves. ? The user defined volatility structures
can  be of an extremely general? form. Closed-form solutions are?  developed 
for
pricing standard European options, and efficient Monte  Carlo? schemes are
presented for pricing exotic options. The chapter  closes with a discussion of
the valuation of American style  options.



Chapter 9 focuses on the risk? management of  energy derivative positions. ? 
In
this chapter we discuss the  management of price risk for institutions? that
trade options or other  derivatives and who are then faced with the problem? 
of
managing the  risk through time. ? We begin with delta hedging a  portfolio
containing derivatives and look? at extensions to gamma  hedging ? 
illustrating
the techniques using both spot and? forward  curve models. The general? model
presented in Chapter 8 is ideally  suited to multi-factor hedging of a? 
portfolio
of energy derivatives  and this is also discussed.



Chapter 10 examines the key  risk? management concept of Value at Risk (VaR)
applied to portfolios  containing? energy derivative products. After? 
discussing
the  concept of the measure, we look at how the key inputs?  (volatilities,
covariances, correlations, etc) can be estimated. We then  compare the fours
major? methodologies for computing VaR; Delta,  Delta-gamma, historical
simulation and? Monte-Carlo simulation,  applying each to the same portfolio 
of
energy? options. In this  chapter we also? look at testing the VaR estimates 
for
various  underlying energy market? variables.



Finally, in Chapter  11 we review? modelling approaches to credit risk. ? We 
look
in  detail at two quite different approaches, CreditMetrics (J. P. Morgan  
(1997))
and? CreditRisk+ (Credit Suisse Financial? Products  (1997)) for which 
detailed

of
tools with which to measure credit  risk. We present numerical examples of
applying these techniques to energy  derivatives.


Before? we begin we stress that the models and  methods we present in this 
book
are tools? which should be used with  the benefit of an understanding of how 
both
the ?tool?? and the market  works. The? techniques we describe are certainly 
not
?magic wands?  which can be waved at? data and risk management problems to
provide  instant and perfect solutions. To quote from the RiskMetrics  
Technical
Document ?? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace  experience and
professional judgement in managing risk.?. ? However,  the right tools, 
correctly

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

This is a message of discussing the problem in Lacima's paper. I think that
Glen Dixon has told you there is a fault in the paper written by Dr. Clewlow
and Dr. Strickland. It is understandable to have some errors in their work.
People always make mistakes.

Actually, I found the problem in appendix A of their paper. They can't prove
the eq. A4 rigorously. There is something wrong in mathematical
interpretation. If you like, I can give you a full analysis of this problem.

PS: attached with their paper.

best regard
Quentin

John,
Attached is a copy of the SDDP Methodology manual, written by the 
developers.  The model was developed by Mario Pereira, who is the proprietor 
of PSRI (Power Systems Research Inc) in Rio de Janeiro.   Their web site is: 
www.psr-inc.com where you can find more information about the company and 
contact details.  Mario and most of the staff speak English, so phone calls 
are possible.  

Development of SDDP was originally done on a World Bank contract to compare 
the benefits of new generation and transmission system interconnections in 
Central America.  It has since found much wider application.  The code runs 
on a PC, and is licensed to a number of consultants, power companies, etc.  
While I was with ECNZ in Wellington, New Zealand, we purchased a copy around 
1994.

The model works with weekly or monthly time steps, with a time horizon of 
from 1 to 10 years, for mid to long range planning of hydro thermal power 
systems.  It represents loads in each period as from one to five load blocks, 
so it is not a chronological model.  This type of model can not handle 
thermal plant ramp rates and similar chronological system constraints.  I'm 
not sure how important that would be to you.  The optimization phase of the 
model takes into account hydrological uncertainty using a form of stochastic 
dynamic programming with sampling.  This phase sets up a function for water 
value in each large reservoir in the system.  The simulation phase uses a 
number of hydrological outcomes to collect statistics on how the system would 
operate.  The water values can be used with the short term optimization mode 
of SDDP or in some other more detailed short term optimization model.

Most constraints found in hydro systems can be modelled.  Many transmission 
constraints can be modelled.  A DC load flow option can be used to determine 
bus nodal prices.

A Visual Basic user interface is provided which reads and writes text files.

If you'd like to know more about SDDP, you could call me here in Houston.

Vince,

Hi, hope you are well.
?
I'm just dropping a note regarding invoice 215 which was for 5 people  
attending the energy and weather course.? Our records show that it hasn't  
been paid, which is good.? We will re-do the invoice and charge you only  for 
Alex and Tom's attendance since Paulo didn't show.? Is this OK with  you?? By 
the way, we only charged $250 a person for the weather course  since it was 
suppose to be an exchange of information session, and Enron Weather  paid for 
the venue.
?
Nice to have finally met you in Houston!

Dear Dr. Kaminski

This is Quentin Kerr again from Australia. As I mentioned brefore, my paper
will be ready soon. Please find out the attachment with the draft of my
paper (hasn't submitted yet). There are always some errors in my paper.
Please read it, give me some suggestions. Any comments will be appreciated.

By the way, I would like to ask you, have you received my resume? I sent it
to you about two weeks ago.

PS: attached with the pdf file.

Thanks
Quentin

Hi Vince,
?
I sent the attached for Enron's approval to Fiona Grant, but haven't heard  
back.? In the contract that we signed it states that we need to seek  
approval from Enron if we want to use the company name.? Is there someone  
else we should direct these requests?
?
Hope you are well.

Fiona,

I've attached a letter that is going to be?sent out to some  universities, 
promoting the Energy Derivative book.? Are we allowed to  mention, "...in 
association with Enron Corp."?? Please see attached.
?
Should we check with you every time we would like to use "Enron Corp." when  
advertising the book?? It will usually follow similar format.

Vince,

I spoke with Whalley at the SA offsite and he mentioned that had (or knew of) 
a person that could bring some talent to the evaluation of an Enron merchant 
business in Japan.  I am in Sydney today, but will be in Tokyo next week.  I 
would like to speak more about this.  What time might you be available?  My 
Japan mobile number is 81 90 4073 6761.

Dear Lucie,

When I agreed to speak at the above conference, it was agreed that Enron 
could bring another staff member to attend gratis. However, I noticed that 
Enron is actually providing two speakers - Dr Vince Kamainski and myself. It 
would be appreciated if we could instead of sending two staff members to the 
same seminar that Enron sends one staff member to the Aust Energy seminar and 
one staff member to the RISK 2000 - Sydney seminar in August 22-23. The 
length & pricing are similar for both the seminars.

Upon your reply, i will supply the names of the staff members, there is 
strong internal competition to go.

Thank you, Raymond

Joe,

He is a research assistant of Prof. Darrell Duffie from Stanford
and I met him in this capacity. A very bright fellow.

I could not assess his commercial skills but he has enough common
sense to identify the winner (as his interest in Enron demonstrates).

Dear Vince Kaminski

Thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting.

I have been always inspired by and having respect for the
recent revolutionary achievements of Enron in the energy markets
My former employer McKinsey Tokyo in fact featured
your company*s success in the last Quarterly, and it clearly states
(in Japanese though) that the quantitative research capability at Enron
is now at the world*s top level, which has been always behind the scene.

I am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact
interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field;
However, very unfortunately I will have to come back to Japan, or at
least to the East Asian region,  upon graduation due to an inevitable
family reason. My wife*s father passed away recently and an old
mother-in-law is now left alone without relatives. I understand that
Enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing
the outdated Japanese energy market, (which by the way I strongly
hope ) so I may not have a very good chance of making contribution
at your company right now.

Lastly, if you need a staff in Tokyo in some future who understands
 both the risk management analytics at the F622 level and the local
language and business custome better than average, please contact
me any time.  I will be happy to assist as much as possible.

Yours sincerely,
