Attached is the regulatory briefing presented today to Stan Horton, Peggy Fowler, Mark Metts, Jim Piro, Mary Turina, Steve Hawke and a group of other folks (who were here for the PGE/Enron budget discussions).  Note that Mark Dodson participated in the regulatory briefing (but not the budget meeting) at Peggy's invitation.  Jessica Uhl participated by phone.  Mike Morgan joined me at the table.  

    

FYI.  All the timelines were presented as "proposed, draft" and "very aggressive."  We also noted that the proposed October 19 meeting with FERC staff and the October 16 meetings with the Oregon parties would be key meetings.  

One change in the briefing since the meeting:  Mark Metts, Kristina Mordaunt, and Mark Dodson should be included as part of the "SEC Team."

The short answer is that the Dynegy merger with Enron does not affect
the NWN acquisition of PGE.  Both Enron and Dynegy remain committed to
the NWN transaction.  There are no direct implications for the sale as
NWN, not Enron, is the issuer of the equity in the transaction.  The
structure of the seller financing has not changed.  

Bruce DeBolt did describe the only indirect impact of Enron's current
situation--i.e., that there are certain restrictions on Enron's ability
to transfer the securities it holds to an affiliated interest if Enron's
credit rating decays to a given point.  

The Enron/Dynegy transaction is expected to close in the 3rd Quarter of
2002.  We think we can get all regulatory approvals for the NWN
transaction completed and close before that.  

I'm in Washington, D.C. today and tomorrow.  We have a pre-filing
meeting with the SEC on the NWN transaction tomorrow.  I'll be back in
the office on Friday.  I can be reached by pager 888.354.7356 or cell
phone 503.539.4733 if you need more information or have further
questions.

Subject: EFSC and NRC Sierra acqusition filings

Jay asked me to give you an update on these - it's as follows:
PGE has filed for NRC approval as an indirect transfer of PGE's licenses for
Trojan.  We have also filed a petition for a declaration ruling that EFSC
approval is not required.

Status:   We anticipate NRC approval by the end of May; no difficulty in
obtaining approval is expected.  NRC has not issued a federal register notice
of it's planned action yet, but we expect that by the beginning of May.   EFSC
will likely decide to grant the petition to issue a declaratory ruling at its
May 19 meeting in Pendleton, and to issue a ruling in our favor at its June
meeting.  We are monitoring both filings.  dn

Steve:

Here are the talking points and Dan's backup document.  As you can see, both 
documents focus on using the CRT proceeding or the Petition for Rulemaking 
proceeding as the procedural vehicle for FERC to act, but we shouldn't have 
to make too many changes to the talking points to incorporate the new ideas 
we discussed with Adam this morning.

Let me know what you think.

Question:  why do we need from jan 8 to jan 31 to respond to staff comments?  
I think we should squeeze that time dramatically to take a shot at Jan or 
early Feb resolution.  If there is slippage, I don't want our earliest target 
date to be the end of Feb.

Steve - regarding the possible delay of market opening in Nevada and impact 
on PGE sale -

Sierra has fuel cost passthrough in its restructuring settlement.  
If market opening is delayed, there may be an impact on the settlement. 
If the settlement falls through, Sierra may lose fuel cost passthrough.  
If Sierra loses fuel cost passthrough, they may lose financial stability.  
This would not play well in Oregon. 

See Paul's comments below for a more thorough description.

Paul Kaufman@ECT
09/15/2000 01:10 PM
To: Harry Kingerski/HOU/EES@EES

Subject: Nevada

Sorry for my confusion.  Here's the bottom-line.

Sierra and NPCo (collectively "Sierra") entered into a global settlement with 
other stakeholders in Nevada that among other things:  (a) set the open 
access dates for various customers (the earliest of which is 10/1/00 for 
NPCo's largest customers); and (b) allow Sierra and NPCo to seek monthly 
adjustments to their rates for fuel and purchased power expenses; and (c) 
made various payments to Sierra for implementing restructuring; and (d) 
provided NPCo with a "Base Tariff Energy Rate" increase of about 6.5%.
PUCN approval of the settlement was key to resolving the Oregon PUC's 
concerns with Sierra's financial stability.  
Nevada Governor Guinn and PUCN Chairman Soderberg met two days ago to discuss 
the settlements and open access dates.
 The day prior to this meeting the Democratic leadership of the legislature 
issued a joint statement condemning the settlements and restructuring.
If Governor Guinn acts on restructuring or the settlements he could unwind 
the settlements.  If the settlements are unwound, there would likely be 
collateral damage in Oregon.  We are expecting OPUC action no later than 
October 24.  There are also agenda meetings scheduled for September 29 and 
October 10.
In meetings with the PUCN Commissioners yesterday, there was little if any 
concern that the Governor will act.  However, there was substantial concern 
that the legislature will get in the way and that public pressure is 
mounting.  
I agree with this assessment.  It is unlikely that the Governor will act 
without agreement from those parties (i.e., the consumer advocate and the 
resort association) that negotiated the settlements.
Further, Sierra's right to seek monthly adjustments is statutory and 
(arguably) available to Sierra regardless of the rate freeze imposed by SB 
438 (enacted in 1999).
Nevada, however, is an odd place and odd things do happen.  Further, it is 
beyond question that the Nevada legislature will take action on restructuring 
next session.  
Note, further, that if the legislature does take action: (a) the Governor can 
veto; (b) such a veto will be very, very unpopular; (c) Governor Guinn does 
not want to be a one session Governor; and (d) the Democrats may take control 
of the legislature and state--given politics in general.

Subject: Conversation with Marc Hellman

I spoke at some legnth with Marc Hellman this morning.  He reported
appreciating the meeting but continuing to have concerns.  Generally, I heard
the following:

1.  Marc's not sure what Sierra's strategy is.  It seems unclear given all of
the uproar in Nevada.  Mostly, he isn't hearing that it is the same as what he
perceives PGE's strategy to be: focus on the local service territory, serve
customers well, and see where that takes you.  While I assured him that Sierra
was committed to a T&D business (witness the genreation sale), I think there
is more to do in this regard.

2.  Finance issues remain very high.  Staff is concerned Sierra is (or will
be) strapped for cash and will drain off $$ from PGE.  This was partly behind
his remark re service quality standards;  Those are not much better than the
paper they are written on unless the utility believes it is its business
interest to comply.  The fines alone won't do it.  Better minds on finance
than mine can probably figure out creative ways to get at this but it is
probably not enough to say that banks are willing to lend the $$.  

3.  I pushed again for a data request to Sierra for your side of the orders
etc. Staff has found that concern them.  Marc promised to act on this.  I took
a few minutes to tell him a bit about Alturas, mostly to say that he would
want PGE to be as aggressive if we were facing similar issues.  This will be a
critical response.

4.  At one point, he seemed to suggest that Sierra could make depositions of
the Nevada Staff happen.  I told him in no uncertain terms that that was up to
the Commission, not Sierra.  Nonetheless, it looks like these won't happen. 
If you all think that a deposition of the head Staff down there could HELP,
you probably need to pull whatever strings you can to make it happen.   
Meanwhile, we know that Staff's attorney (Paul Graham) has advised them they
cannot rely on annecdotes and must use orders if they don't have depositions.

4.  Marc indicated that, from a quick review of data request responses, he
didn't think Sierra was as on top of service quality as we were, particularly
not in the south, and didn't have as good a working relationship with the
Commission in this area.  Is this perception correct and, if not, what can we
pull out to show it is not?  Marc did recollect Malyn saying that the most
recent customer survey placed them very high and he was going to go look for
the response with that survey.

5.  Staff is willing to attempt to narrow the issues and not go for "big bang"
testimony in the first round (or at least Marc says to be) but efforts to
narrow issues will have to end the 1st or 2nd week of May so that they have
time to develop testimony.  In the meantime, he is checking for me whether
4/21 would work for a working/settlement session.  It would be the afternoon -
I was wrong about the 1149 workshop - that is in the morning.

6.  Marc remarked that it was too bad PGE was such a good utility.  I took the
opportunity to poke him a bit that it would be perverse indeed to allow a
"poor" utility to follow its shareholders wishes (i.e. approve PacifiCorp's
merger with Scottish) but deny a "good" utility that ability.  He seemed to
get the point.  I will work this with Bill as well.  

I'm scheduled with CUB today and will probe for their state of mind and will
also keep trying to get a hold of Ken Canon to see where he is.  Hopefully we
are on track for the plans we made for 4/21 and can make some progress then.

Subject:  RE: Important -  Further Information

Jonathan, I have spoken with Mitch Taylor and Pamela this morning after
talking to you.  While both calls were cut short, after I talked to Mitch he
was encouraging us to go with our original sur-rebuttle and not with the
revised Ruelle testimony.  At the same time Pamela was worried that we
needed to stick with the original sur-rebuttle and to incorporate the
changes that she felt were important to make.  My concern all along is that
we correctly inform the OPUC as to the facts in Nevada while at the same
time getting this transaction closed.  It seems to me that the common wisdom
of those closest to the OPUC and the OPUC staff is to file the sur-rebuttle
that outlines our plans for the PGE acquistion and rate plan, responds to
staffs concerns raised in their rebuttle and to do so on Monday.  Pamela
suggested that we could inform all of the parties, which includes the OPUC
of the events that are likely to be disclosed on Monday via letter.   During
our conversation it was clear that Mitch had concerns about using the
rebuttle testimony as the way to convey our current status in Nevada to the
parties in Oregon.  I would like to suggest that we follow the advice that
we are getting from PGE and Enron on this as they are closest to the OPUC
staff and others in Oregon.  We will need to add a couple of paragraphs to
Mark's testimony that will make what he testifys to in District Court on
Monday consistant with the sur-rebuttle in Oregon.  We will go back to my
original sur-rebuttle as improved by PGE, Enron, yourself and Beth for
filing on Monday.  Coupled with the responses we make to the OPUC staff next
week on the recent data requests we can make sure that we have informed all
parties of the critical facts in Nevada.  This all makes sense to me as we
will know more on Monday after the District Court hearing in Nevada, we will
have made our press release and energy filing in Nevada and all parties will
then be informed as to the nature of whats going on.  I am still hopeful
that we will have resolution to the situation in Nevada in a timly manner
but I cannot be sure of it.  Thanks for the hard work this weekend on the
tough issues and for your advice in how best to get the deal with PGE closed
soon.   steve oldham

I have just learned informally from Mike Morgan that Enron is likely to take
the position that the 10AM version of Ruelle is not a best efforts
presentation.

To that end, please consider seriously the additions I have proposed in the
draft circulated about 12:45 today.

Also, please consider that with little additional effort (since the material
is already written), we could include almost everything we have drafted but
for the revised rate proposal.

It seems to me that there are two reasons for submitting as much as we can:
first, it helps play defense with Enron.   Second, it helps communicate with
the staff and the commission, and thus positions us for a positive outcome
in due course.

Paul,

Thanks for the update.  With regard to further interference from the PUCN, 
and the comment that the PUCN must approve each generation divestiture of 
Sierra, do we anticipate any of these (the generation divestitures) closing 
prior to the Sierra/PGE closing?

I'll check with CSFB to get their perspective.

Thanks,

Mitch

Timing for PUC Review

Staff/ICNU/NWIGU/CUB meeting is scheduled for October 16.   Re:  timing in Oregon, the following from an Oregonian article in today's Business Section:

"Richard Reiten, chairman and chief executive of NW Natural, predicted a regulatory review period of nine months to 12 months. But Hemmingway expects a speedier schedule because commissioners know the utilities well. 
"I hope we can deal with this expeditiously," Hemmingway said."
We intend to circulate a schedule at our meeting on October 16 that suggests a 5 or six month schedule (from the date of filing through OPUC decision).  
NRC and EFSEC

I talked with Doug Nichols, PGE's General Counsel, yesterday re:  NRC.  He indicated that the filing should be relatively easy to prepare.  He will prepare the filing and forward the document to NNG's counsel for review.   

We will follow a similar process for Oregon EFSEC.  The EFSEC filing will be a petition for declaratory order (that EFSEC doesn't have jurisdiction over the transaction).  Recall that Oregon EFSEC issued a ruling of no jurisdiction in the Sierra transaction.

Let me know if we need outside counsel review on the NRC filing.  Doug stated that we used in-house resources entirely for NRC approval in the Sierra transaction.  I'm fairly certain we used in-house resources for the EFSEC filing as well.

Subject: Timelines on PGE Sale


Attached are our power point slides laying out the time line for FERC
action.  The estimated time frames for FERC action, even without a
settlement, are somewhat more positive than we discussed yesterday (e.g.,
FERC order on the merits after a technical conference by mid-February).
Also, the group is somewhat optimistic that the FERC order in November
could be an order on the merits, without additional proceedings such as a
technical conference or a hearing.  These optimistic time tables are based
on the assumption that Sierra will not take any action that will alienate
or annoy FERC, which could result in a slowdown in FERC's approval process.

Adam Wenner, Steve Angle, Sam Behrends, Joanne Rutkowski and I all
discussed the various time frames that are laid out in the slides, but they
have not seen the slides, so we would like to reserve the right to amend
the slides once everyone has a chance to review them.  Also, as we
discussed yesterday, we would like to be able to revise the slides, if
necessary, tomorrow once we get FERC's agenda for its November 8 meeting
and we see what action FERC takes in the California investigation on price
spikes this past summer.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Sarah

While incentivizing the deal may be helpful from a business perspective, I'm 
not sure it will do much with the timing at the SEC.  As you know, there are 
two major issues: (i) the integration, which we believe we have more or less 
under control, and (ii) the capital structure of the resulting system, which 
is dependent in the first instance on the timing of the Sierra auction.

The cap structure is a very serious issue.  There is a perception on the part 
of the staff that Sierra is significantly overextended.  As you know, the SEC 
generally requires registered holding companies to maintain a minimum of 30% 
common equity.  Currently, the best that Sierra can offer is that they will 
be at 20.8% common equity at closing, with a representation that Sierra will 
increase its consolidated common equity to approximately 29 percent as a 
result of: (a) proceeds from the sale of generating assets of Sierra Pacific 
and Nevada Power aggregating approximately $1 billion, 100 percent of which 
will reduce debt of the consolidated company; (b) proceeds from divestiture 
of non-core assets, or some combination of common equity and divestiture of 
non-core assets, which together would be approximately equivalent to the 
issuance of $260 million in terms of impact on Sierra Pacific's equity ratio; 
(c) issuance of up to $600 million of hybrid securities; and (d) increased 
retained earnings realized from the combined operations of Sierra and PGE 
aggregating approximately $80 million in 2000 and $100 million in 2001.

In other matters, the SEC staff has indicated that it would give "credit" 
toward equity capitalization if the company has executed definitive 
agreements for sale of the subject assets.  What is the status of the Sierra 
auction, and how quickly will they have signed agreements?

Concerning state issues and the intervenorts, Steve Oldham and the folks from 
Skadden are meeting with the GC of the Nevada Commission (at his request) 
next week to clean up the Nevada issues so I don't think that will be a 
problem.

What remains is the monkey wrench intervenors throw into any 1935 Act 
proceeding.  Regardless of how successful we are on the above issues, the 
presence of the California intervenors means that the matter must be 
presented to the full SEC for consideration.  Because of the delays inherent 
in that process, we will need all FERC and state issues resolved by 
September, or early October at the latest, in order to have a realistic 
chance at a year-end order.

The only other thing that might prove helpful would be a price escalation 
provision so we could tell the SEC that there is a significant cost 
associated with their failure to act in FY 2000.  There are a number of 
concerns with this approach: among other things, we would have to explain to 
the SEC why we're inserting it now.

I realize this is a bit long-winded but it seems we're getting close to our 
last best shot at year end and I'd think we'd want to plan our strategy 
carefully.

Best,

Joanne

>>> <Dwight.Larson@enron.com> 08/16/00 10:20AM >>>
A meeting with Walt Higgins has been scheduled for Thursday in Las
Vegas and attendees from Enron will be Mark, Mitch and Steve.  The
discussions will probably be more global than specific, however I'ld like
everyone to forward to me their wish list  of items so I can summarize them
for Mark prior to their meeting.  I'ld also appreciate input from everyone
on the impact of amending the stock purchase agreement ( i.e. incorporating
some incentive type payment if the deal closes this year) and the
sensitivity to the timing of that amendment. What is the impact if it is
done 1) prior to OPUC settlement, 2) prior to the Oregon Commission ruling,
or 3) before or after the FERC addresses our filing.
After collecting peoples input, I'll circulate the summary this
afternoon.
Paul , could you please forward this to Mike Morgan - I didn't have
his e-mail address.
thanks

Ann, Sarah, Jay and Adam:

 I spoke with Brian Mohr at Skadden this morning.  He said that when
he spoke to Jade at the end of last week about her investigation, she said
that her recommendation had gone up the line to the front office, that she
did not need any additional information and that unless her superiors wanted
additional information, that she did not expect to need anything more from
us.

 I think this means that Jade will likely just let the 30 day waiting
period expire unless someone up the line from her raises questions or issues
(which it doesn't seem as if she expects).  Furthering this interpretation
is that fact that, according to Brian, Jade is out of the office this week,
so it would be difficult for her to begin drafting a second request.

 Brian said he is supposed to talk to Jade on a conference call later
today about another matter, and he will see if she will provide any more
definitive information.  However, assuming she just lets the HSR waiting
period expire, we will be cleared to close (from an antitrust perspective)
at midnight on May 3rd.

As you all may know, we have scheduled a conference call for the group for 
Thursday, Oct. 19.  Bernadette called each of your assistants, so it should 
be on your calendars.

As a brief update prior to our call:

We have a phone call in to FERC to check on the procedural status of the 
merger.  Donna Fulton, my colleague in Washington, has many contacts at FERC 
and is working with those people to learn what she can about the status of 
our proceeding.  

Joanne is supposed to be meeting with Bob Wasson at the SEC (along with Bill 
Weedon) early next week to get a sense of where the SEC is on the case.

Per Rick's suggestion, I have asked another colleague of mine in Washington, 
Chris Long, to help us decide who would be the appropriate person to make 
contact at the SEC if we decide to make that contact.  Chris is working with 
some political operatives on this.

We have been working with Portland General and Sierra on their RTO filing.  
As you may recall, a commitment to join an RTO (Regional Transmission 
Organization) is one of the things FERC will require of the merging parties.  
An RTO filing will be made at FERC on October 23.  While RTO progress has 
been good so far, Sierra and PGE have indicated that they may have concerns 
with the RTO they are working with (the Northwest RTO).  We are working with 
Sierra and PGE to make sure that they do not do anything in the RTO 
proceeding that could cause concern for FERC regarding the companies' 
commitment to join an RTO.

There was some question about the status of a temporary services company 
being created by the merged company.  Joanne has been working with the Sierra 
and PGE people on this issue and does not see this as being a problem now, 
but I have asked her for confirmation that this "alternative" type of service 
company arrangement will not delay the SEC proceeding.  I am waiting for a 
response from Joanne.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Sarah

Attached are our power point slides laying out the time line for FERC 
action.  The estimated time frames for FERC action, even without a 
settlement, are somewhat more positive than we discussed yesterday (e.g., 
FERC order on the merits after a technical conference by mid-February).  
Also, the group is somewhat optimistic that the FERC order in November could 
be an order on the merits, without additional proceedings such as a technical 
conference or a hearing.  These optimistic time tables are based on the 
assumption that Sierra will not take any action that will alienate or annoy 
FERC, which could result in a slowdown in FERC's approval process.

Adam Wenner, Steve Angle, Sam Behrends, Joanne Rutkowski and I all discussed 
the various time frames that are laid out in the slides, but they have not 
seen the slides, so we would like to reserve the right to amend the slides 
once everyone has a chance to review them.  Also, as we discussed yesterday, 
we would like to be able to revise the slides, if necessary, tomorrow once we 
get FERC's agenda for its November 8 meeting and we see what action FERC 
takes in the California investigation on price spikes this past summer.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Steve:

I spoke with Sam Behrends, Adam Wenner (FERC attorneys) and Joanne Rutkowski 
(SEC attorney) about your question on a third quarter close.   On the FERC 
side, protests to the merger application are due on May 3.  We are expecting 
protests, but until we see the extent of the opposition, its hard to estimate 
the likelihood of a July order.  However, we all agree that based on the 
facts of the merger and the types of protests we expect to see, a July order 
is within the realm of possibility.  FERC just issued an order approving the 
PECO/ComEd merger earlier this week.  The order was issued 142 days after the 
merger application was filed.  If FERC does not find the opposition to the 
PGE/Sierra merger overwhelming, it could issue an order before FERC goes on 
August recess (this would also allow FERC to meet its 150 day target for 
acting on merger petitions).  

Even if a FERC order is issued by the end of July, we will still need SEC 
approval.  (The SEC will not issue its order until FERC has approved the 
merger.)  Joanne Rutkowski thinks that although a September order from the 
SEC is possible, it is not likely, due mainly to the fact that several other 
big merger proceedings (NSP, AEP, Energy East, ComEd) are in the queue ahead 
of the PGE/Sierra merger awaiting SEC approval.  

With regard to the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with DOJ, DOJ approval is 
normally not a problem, but attorneys with DOJ have expressed some concern 
that the merged Sierra/PGE company could have potential market power in 
transmission going into southern California.  DOJ has submitted a request for 
information to Sierra and PGE, and we are working on the response to that 
request now.  Our attorneys and Sierra's attorneys do not think at this point 
that obtaining DOJ approval of the merger will be a problem, but until we 
receive final DOJ sign-off on the merger, DOJ review will continue to be an 
open issue.  We should have a better idea of whether DOJ is going to raise 
any significant problems with the merger within the next couple of months.

I see that Paul sent you a separate email on the status of the state 
proceedings.

I hope this is helpful.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Adam Wenner prepared the attached chart laying out the various mitigation 
options.  As you can see from the chart, some of the mitigation measures are 
much more complicated than others.  FERC appears to have concerns with the 
more complicated mitigation measures, but the more complicated measures also 
cost little or nothing to implement.

Please call me if you have any questions.

I think it would be useful to distribute this prior to our call on Monday,
so that the group could be thinking along those lines sooner rather than
later.

Please see the attached email.  Interventions and protests are due on the 
merger application by May 3 (60 days from the day we submitted the 
application (March 3)).  Comments on the joint Open Access tariff are due on 
March 24, but we anticipate more activity on the application rather than the 
tariff.  We'll keep you posted on both proceedings as pleadings are filed 
with FERC.

Attached is a quick blurb on the major protests filed in the PGE/Sierra 
merger.  There's good news and bad news.  The good news is that there were 
only a couple of significant protests filed.  The bad new is that the 
protests are quite significant.  In addition to the two protests Adam 
addresses, there was a protest filed by the Nevada Public Service Commission, 
and an additional protest filed by Truckee Donner.  The Nevada Attorney 
General's Bureau of Consumer Protection also filed a brief protest.  

We are getting a copy of the rest of the protests now and will have a more 
detailed summary of all of the protests early next week.  

Adam has been in touch with the Scadden attorneys and Peter Fox-Penner, the 
economic consultant who performed the Appendix A market power analysis.  We 
will be working closely with them to develop an answer to the protests.  
Answers are due on May 18.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks for the update. My only concern is that we should really try to go for a much shorter time period for Oregon.  I would think about 6 months.  After all, that is NWN's attraction.  Our goal should be to reach CLOSING in 9 months.  Paul, can you talk to Mark and make sure that Sue Ackerman is on board?  Thanks.

Subject:	update

Three matters:

1.	Conference call with Staff.

Particpants were:  Phil Nyegaard (staff lead for the Enron/PGE merger and currently acting chief of staff); Bryan Conway (lead staff electric techie and staff on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Mark Helman (Staff lead on PGE's rate case and the lead on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Lee Sparling (a lead on a number of gas company cases); and Bonnie Tatum (lead staff gas techie).  The call went well.  Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital.  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling.  

	Timing.  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order.  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months.  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame.  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases.  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices.

	Financing.  Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse.   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing.  

	Other Regulatory Review.  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company.  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate.  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction.  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited.  

	Process.  Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners.  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary.  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process.  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details.  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed).  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction.   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!).  We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings.  

2.	Other parties

	Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday.  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call.  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today's article.  He questioned NNG's ability to finance the purchase of a larger company.  In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG's ability to finance the transaction.  The only other concern he raised was NNG's practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature.  

	We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively.

3.	Rate Conditions.

	We're still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition.  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG's ROE earnings test.   Under this approach, PGE would:  (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points.  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case.

	Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze.  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history.  Fuel savings (resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities) would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNG's PGA and through PGE's PCA (of its progeny).  

	PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings.  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG.  

4.	FERC Review

	We're pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRA's market power analysis.  A revised schedule for the FERC, SEC, OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by mid-week.

Not much has happened with the federal filings since we submitted them (SEC 
application was filed on February 4, FERC application was filed on March 3).  
Ann has been keeping everyone updated on the DOJ review of the HSR filing.  

With regard to the FERC filing, FERC separated the section 203 merger 
application from the section 205 joint open access tariff filing.   
Interventions and protests to the joint transmission tariff (which will be 
used by the merged companies once the merger occurs), were due to be filed at 
the end of March.  Interventions and protests to the section 203 application 
are due May 3.  

One party asked FERC to extend the deadline for interventions and protests on 
the tariff to be extended to May 3, and FERC granted that request.  However, 
several parties filed interventions before FERC granted the extension, so 
some comments have been filed.  The only significant substantive comment came 
from the Public Utility Commission of Nevada (PUCN).  PUCN opposes the 
merging parties' license plate rate proposal and instead favors a rolled-in 
rate structure (where the rates of the three individual systems -- Nevada 
Power, Sierra Pacific, and Portland General) are averaged together so that 
transmission customers on any of the three systems would pay the same 
transmission rate, regardless of which system they use.  

We have some answers to this protest.  First, one of FERC's main concerns 
with regard to transmission rates is the elimination of pancaked rates 
(paying multiple transmission rates for moving over multiple systems).  The 
joint open access tariff eliminates pancaking and uses instead a license 
plate approach (pay the rate of the system where the power is being delivered 
and have transmission access over all three systems for that one rate).  
Second, if the rates are averaged together, rate payers in the low cost 
region will pay a higher transmission rate.  Third, depending on the RTO 
configuration, PGE could be in a separate RTO from Sierra and Nevada, so 
different rates, at least for PGE, would be warranted.  

We plan on filing an answer to the PUCN protest at the same time we file an 
answer to the other protests and comments that will be filed on May 3.   FERC 
does not typically allow answers to protests, so we did not want to submit 
multiple answers to the various pleadings.  We expect the majority of 
protests to be filed in the section 203 merger application docket.  Once we 
see the extent of the protests, we will have a better idea of whether FERC 
should be able to issue an order on the merger by the end of July (before 
they leave for August recess).

The SEC proceeding has been quiet.  There are four major mergers ahead of our 
application (AEP/CSW, Energy East, NSP/New Century, ComEd/PECO), so we do not 
expect the SEC to focus on our filing until they are closer to ruling on 
these other mergers.  

We will keep you posted on any significant events on the federal side.  In 
the meantime, please call or email me if you have any questions.

Mitch, Don't kill me, just call.


Attached are  revised slides, revised as follows:

1. Cover page adds "OPUC" and changes the date to today's date
2. The first bullet under the FERC timeline -- added statement that FERC 
order is more likely to be issued towards the end of the year
3. Under Additional Information Required -- included statement that the 
delivered price test on the Alturas Line should include various buyback 
options for Sierra from its divested generators
4. Under Issues to be Resolved -- consolidated three bullets into two 
discussing the potential impact California plays  on FERC's action on the 
merger
5. Deleted the bullet under the SEC slide stating that the SEC could begin 
considering the application before FERC  issues its final order -- we could 
not verify this with Joanne, and Sam Behrends said he thinks the SEC is 
unlikely to act on the application (due to workload) before FERC issues its 
order.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Enclosed is a memo setting forth a schedule for obtaining the outstanding SEC 
approvals before the end of April.

Without concluding that the SEC will necessarily renotice the merger 
application, we believed it necessary to allow for the possibility.

The result, as you see, is a tight, albeit doable, schedule.  In particular, 
it underscores the need to develop our story for the SEC as quickly as 
possible, consistent with the other impossible demands that folks are placing 
on Sierra's time.

If you have any questions or there's anything we can do to help, please call 
me at (202) 986-8281.

Subject: SEC Timing


Mark and Dwight,

You've asked us to outline a strategy for getting the SEC order by year-end.

The first issue is to get rid of the intervenors.  If we can tell the SEC 
staff that we are settling with TANC and SMUD and the Nevada Commission, we 
can ask them to focus again on the substantive issues.

As you know, there are two major issues: (i) the integration, which we 
believe we have more or less under control, and (ii) the capital structure of 
the resulting system, which is dependent in the first instance on the timing 
of the Sierra auction.

Concerning integration, the question is whether Sierra's "blended approach" 
(that is, a 50 MW long-term firm path between PGE and Nevada Power and a 
combination of nonfirm and short-term firm linking Sierra to the rest of the 
system) is beyond current SEC precedent.  In AEP and Xcel, the SEC found that 
a long-term firm path was sufficient to establish that two parts of a system 
were "physically interconnected or capable of interconnection."  Although 
Xcel also involved the use of a nonfirm path, that was on an interim basis, 
pending the completion of certain upgrades necessary for the firm contract 
path.  Absent some statement to the contrary, it is our understanding that 
the staff would not approve the "blended approach" by delegated authority.

There is, however, an alternative approach to integration under which we 
would ask the SEC staff to find that PGE and Nevada were integrated and that 
Sierra constituted a permissible "additional" system under the (A)(B)(C) 
clauses of Section 11(b)(1).  Sierra has completed the studies needed to 
justify this approach.  Based on conversations with Bob Wason and Cathey 
Baker on the SEC staff, we believe that this approach could be approved by 
delegated authority.


Concerning the capital structure of the resulting system, there is a 
perception on the part of the staff that Sierra is significantly 
overextended.  As you know, the SEC generally requires registered holding 
companies to maintain a minimum of 30% common equity.  While there is 
precedent to support a floor of 27.6%, the staff has advised companies that 
they will require a minimum of 28.5% equity, with a commitment to reach 30% 
within  a reasonable period of time, before approving a matter pursuant to 
delegated authority.

There is some confusion about Sierra's prospects in this regard.  The most 
recent amendment, filed June 14th, indicates that Sierra will be at 20.8% 
common equity at closing, with a representation that Sierra will increase its 
consolidated common equity to approximately 29 percent as a result of: (a) 
proceeds from the sale of generating assets of Sierra Pacific and Nevada 
Power aggregating approximately $1 billion, 100 percent of which will reduce 
debt of the consolidated company; (b) proceeds from divestiture of non-core 
assets, or some combination of common equity and divestiture of non-core 
assets, which together would be approximately equivalent to the issuance of 
$260 million in terms of impact on Sierra Pacific's equity ratio; (c) 
issuance of up to $600 million of hybrid securities; and (d) increased 
retained earnings realized from the combined operations of Sierra and PGE 
aggregating approximately $80 million in 2000 and $100 million in 2001.

It is unclear how good these numbers are.  They do not, for example, reflect 
Sierra's second quarter earnings release or the effect of a writeoff in 
connection with PGE's Trojan Plant.
Bill Weeden will be meeting with Mark Ruelle Thursday to come up with "firm" 
numbers.

In other matters, the SEC staff has indicated that it would give "credit" 
toward equity capitalization if the company has executed definitive 
agreements for sale of the subject assets, such as the Sierra water business 
and its generation assets.  It is important to know when such sales may be 
announced so that we can factor them into our calculations.

Assuming that Sierra can establish, based on these types of definitive 
agreements, that the merged company will be at 28.5% (once the underlying 
sales close) and Nevada has indicated that it will withdraw its intervention 
and Oregon has indicated that it will approve the merger, we would be in a 
position to meet with the SEC staff and ask for a year-end order based on our 
ability to settle with the California intervenors.

Bill said he will call me Thursday after his meetings or Friday at the latest.

Best,

Joanne

Here is the electronic version of the PGE/Sierra answer to the TANC/SMUD 
protest which was filed on Monday.   Unfortunately, everyone was not included 
on the Skadden circulation list to review the drafts of the answer, so to 
rectify this problem, I will forward all future PGE/Sierra merger related 
emails to everyone on this email as I receive them.

We are trying to set up a conference call with the LeBoeuf attorneys (FERC

availability within the next couple of days.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Attached are draft message points for California.  Note that the "what 
happens to Sierra's California customers" discussion is weak, but based on 
the facts.  




I plan on distributing these in draft to Sierra for their comments by COB 
today.  Please contact me with any comments ASAP.

> The same imbalance bringing the near collapse of the California power
> system is sweeping the Western U.S. and prompting nearly every other
> utility to take similar measures to assure reliable utility service.
>  "Nevada, despite a good energy policy, is not immune from what is
> happening in California," said Higgins at a news conference today in Las
> Vegas.  "This situation is unprecedented, unanticipated and potentially
> disastrous for Nevadans if we do not exercise the leadership it takes now

> price. No business can continue selling a product for less than it costs
> them to buy it on the wholesale market.

> lower than in California.
> "Moreover, as part of the plan we propose programs to help low-income
> customers and to help residents and businesses manage their total energy
> bills."
>   In the plan filed today, the companies map out an emergency,
> comprehensive plan to meet the state's short- and long-term energy needs,
> focusing on new mechanisms to recover the skyrocketing cost of wholesale
> power and including automatic price reductions as wholesale prices
> eventually fall. The plan also calls for accelerated approval of new
> long-term power contracts and encourages new power plant development.
> Higgins said the plan also voices agreement with Nevada's go-slow approach
> to electricity deregulation.
> "The Nevada legislature and commission have shown a lot of foresight in
> how to
> handle energy deregulation in the state, and there is no reason to go
> backward," said
> Higgins.  "What we need is to continue forward but in a way that clearly
> anticipates the impact of market forces in the state."
> Higgins noted that the pending sale of generation assets required as part
> of the merger of Sierra Pacific Resources and Nevada Power will allow the
> companies to buy power from the new plant owners at discounted prices for
> two years.  However, he said the California turmoil has slowed the sales
> and put at risk these protective contracts.
>  Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power are proposing that the new mechanism
> take effect on March 1, 2001.  They propose that it be adjusted on March
> 1, 2002, or sooner as wholesale prices fall and if divestiture of the
> utilities' Nevada power plants is completed and contracts are in place
> that guarantee the company can purchase power from those plants for two
> years at 1998 prices.
> Nevada Power customers who use 400 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity or
> less per month and Sierra Pacific customers who use 300 kWh of electricity
> or less per month would not see this increase in their power bills due to
> the tiered rate. The proposal represents an overall increase in rates of
> approximately 17 percent.
>  Higgins said that even with the July 2000 Global Settlement, which
> requires Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific to file monthly rate adjustments
> for fuel and purchased power (the F&PP Rider), the utilities have lost
> over $125 million on fuel and purchased
> power transactions.
> "We are losing millions and millions of dollars now and it will get much
> worse if this plan is not adopted," Higgins said. "We stand to lose
> hundreds of millions more because the caps on price increases are keeping
> rates artificially low. When the settlement was negotiated, no one
> expected prices for fuel and purchased power would continue to skyrocket
> to unheard of levels," Higgins said. "We've saved over $30 million in
> operating efficiencies since the Sierra Pacific - Nevada Power merger, but
> we simply do not have the same ability to control $1.5 billion annually of
> fuel and purchased power expenses in an energy marketplace that's gone
> haywire."
>  In today's filing, the utilities state they will continue to make
> the monthly fuel and purchased power (F&PP) filings, which are scheduled
> to expire on March 1, 2003. Both the F&PP Rider and the new emergency
> Comprehensive Energy Plan (CEP) Rider proposed in the plan represent
> dollar-for-dollar pass through of wholesale costs.
> If approved, the CEP Rider will result in a monthly power bill increase of
> approximately $6.37 for a typical Sierra Pacific residential customer
> using 650 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity per month, and approximately
> $12.63 for a typical Nevada Power residential customer using 1,100 kWh of
> electricity.
> Up to $5 million in revenue generated by the CEP Rider would be provided
> to the State of Nevada to be used at the state's discretion to fund
> conservation and low-income protection programs.
> The proposed tiered rate offers protection for residents with low

>
>     Nevada Power
>  ? First 400 kWh per month   No charge
>  ? Next 275 kWh per month  $0.01500 per kWh

Steve:

Dwight Larson asked Steve Angle and me to prepare a list of mitigation 
measures we believe would help get FERC and SEC approval so that the merger 
could close by year end.  Attached is a list that Steve Angle and I put 
together.  Dwight is preparing a summary of our comments (along with others') 
for your review prior to the meeting with Walt Higgins, but I thought you may 
want to see the list Steve and I put together.

A couple of caveats to the list:  First, for vertical market power, we 
propose that PGE release its firm transmission capacity into California when 
Sierra is using the Alturas line (i.e., at times when TANC and SMUD are 
prevented from importing up to 300 MW into California).  However, the cost to 
PGE to release this capacity is apparently great and could have a material 
adverse effect on PGE.  Therefore, we may need to consider other mitigation 
measures -- such as capping the price of power sold by PGE into California 
during these times.  This mitigation is not as clean as a release of capacity 
-- it requires FERC to monitor PGE's sales and FERC could have some concern 
that PGE could game the rules.  Nevertheless, it may be the only viable form 
of mitigation we have.  We did not propose this alternative option in our 
list of mitigation measures.

Second, we need assurance from PGE that the buyback contracts they are 
negotiating in the sale of their generators will not give Sierra market power 
(a concern raised by FERC in the July 26 order).

Call me if you have any questions.  Good luck with the meeting tomorrow.

Sarah
