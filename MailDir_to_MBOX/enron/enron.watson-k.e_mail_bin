XENERGY Press Release:

DENVER, Co. (02/21/2002) - Leading experts on U.S. green
energy development today expressed confidence that, with
improved marketing techniques, a dramatic growth in
participation in U.S. green energy programs is likely to
occur over the next several years, resulting in penetration
levels viewed highly improbable just one year ago.  The
remarks were made today at The Growing Green Power Demand
Conference, the first green power conference devoted to the
tools, tactics and metrics of selling green power sponsored
by XENERGY in cooperation with the Center for Resource
Solutions.

Green energy programs, which typically involve customers
paying a premium to cover the incremental cost of the
additional renewable resources, have shown steady growth
over the last 5 years, with programs now in existence in 31
states.  However, some believed that the demand for such
services had begun to level off, with participation rates of
most programs in the range of 1 to 5 percent.

A 10% participation rate in a green energy program was until
recently viewed as the industry's three-minute mile, a goal
considered virtually unachievable, said  Julie Blunden, vice
president at XENERGY.  However, tools, tactics and metrics
shared at today's conference indicate that this rate could
be achieved within the next five years.

Surveys consistently reveal customer preference for green
power, said Blair Swezey, Principal Policy Director at the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  There are important
marketing lessons to be gleaned from these utilities that
are having the most success with their green power programs.

Leading organizations around the country - including Fortune
500 companies, major cities and universities are starting to
buy green power, recognizing it as the next step in
environmental responsibility, said Kurt Johnson, Director of
EPA's Green Power Partnership.

We believe today's forum is a microcosm of what is occurring
industry wide, said Keri Bolding, Communications Director at
the Center for Resource Solutions.  Green marketers are
improving their ability to identify likely buyers of green
energy and creating targeted marketing efforts to translate
consumers' desire for green energy into sales.  This is an
exciting time for providers of green energy with substantial
growth likely in the next several years.

XENERGY is an energy consulting, information technology and
energy services firm headquartered in Burlington,
Massachusetts, with offices across the United States and in
Canada. The company offers consulting services on a wide
range of energy issues, including green power, and works
with utilities, energy service companies, industrial and
commercial customers, institutions and government agencies.
Founded in 1975, XENERGY is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
KEMA Consulting (www.kemaconsulting.com).

The Center for Resource Solutions is a non-profit based in
San Francisco that is dedicated to promoting renewable
energy and economic and environmental sustainability. CRS
administers national and international programs that
preserve and protect the environment through the design of
sustainable energy strategies and technologies. More

Ramona, let's add the PNR POI's that are within the path.  Lindy and I discussed that if a shipper wants to Park or Ride this would mean more revenue for TW.  Let's do it now and eliminate the hassle of adding them later.

Thanks,

TK

Lindy,

While testing the new CMS TW contract system, we have come across situations with the firm contracts & PNR points. We need to know how marketing sets up the PNR points on firm contracts. 

Do you want all valid PNR points within the path, to be added as alternate receipt & delivery points  on every firm contract or do you add the PNR points only on request form the customer? Looking at most of the Firm contracts in production today, I do not see many PNR points attached as alternate points.

Please let us know how we should handle PNR points for firm contracts?

Thanks Ramona

Howdy Kimbo!  Hope all is well.

I did not receive the job announcement we spoke about.  I thought maybe the e-mail address I gave you did not get relayed accurately, so I thought I would send you a note.  Maybe you could attach the announcement to this and respond.

You were so very right in what you said the other night.  There definitely is a new day each day with the Enrongate.  Hang in there.  The callous few will not ruin everything for everyone else.  It seems bad now, but I have faith that something good will come from all of this.  

Thanks for thinking of me with the job.  I'll let you know what I do.

Kyle

IPANM Legislative Report 1-24-02

Our legislative meeting in Roswell with the Southeast New Mexico legislators
revealed that the oil and gas industry should not see many issues affecting
it in the current session.  The 2002 Legislative Session is the short 30-day
budget session.  The legislature convened at noon on Tuesday, January 15. It
is scheduled to adjourn at noon, Thursday, February 14.

The New Mexico State Legislature meets for 30 calendar days in the
even-numbered years and for 60 days in the odd-numbered years. The 30-day or
"short session" is constitutionally restricted to fiscal matters, matters
raised by the Governor and bills passed in the previous session that were
vetoed by the Governor.

We are not aware of any significant oil and gas bills pending at this time.

Greg Nibert and Dan Girand

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
     PREVIEW for January 27, 2002

                  And

     SUMMARY of January 20, 2002

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Dear Folks -

   Because of numerous factors, you are receiving not only the preview 
for this coming Ordinary Life gathering but the summary of what was 
done on January 20 as well.

   First, for what is coming up:

   Over the past several years our relationship with our sister church 
in Cochabamba, Bolivia has been growing stronger. The Ordinary Life 
gathering has provided, for several years now, scholarships for people 
who wanted to go do building and medical work there. As you know, one 
of St. Paul's clergy - Diane Wimberly - is spending a year there. Two 
other folks in our community, Dr. Wilson and Nora Boots, go regularly 
to work there. Year before last we provided a substantial amount of 
money to help complete building a medical clinic there.

   Now they have specifically, through Diane, turned to us with an 
appeal for assistance. In order to give you the information needed to 
make a decision about this, I've asked Richard Wingfield to come and 
speak to us about his two trips there.

   He will be showing photos and videos of the work there and 
explaining to us some of what the need is. I'll read you Diane's letter 
to our gathering. There will also be an opportunity for you to see if 
making the next trip to Bolivia is something you would like to 
participate in.

   I sincerely hope you'll come to learn about and provide feedback on 
this important work.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

======================================

   At our last gathering I spoke about the responses to the 
questionnaire that was posted here last September. We had a high 
percentage of returns and each questionnaire was carefully analyzed. 
Edward Harris did an enormous amount of work putting this questionnaire 
together and analyzing it. After hearing the responses last week, we 
had some dialogue about the future direction of Ordinary Life. It was 
very helpful to me and I thank those of you who were present.

   Then I talked about the importance of questions, told a story about 
the most important question of all, and left you with a couple of major 
one's to ponder. What follows is a full text of that part of our time 
together.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

          The Big Question(s)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   Here is a prayer someone sent me:

   I want to thank you, Lord, for being close to me so far this day. 
With your help, I haven't been impatient, grumpy, judgmental, or 
envious with anyone. But I will be getting out of bed in a minute and I 
think that I will really need your help then. Amen

   We do need all the help we can get, don't we? One of the ways help 
comes to us, but which we don't usually recognize, is through 
questions.

   For example:
   Are you here with a purpose?

   What would have to happen for this time we spend together today to 
be a worthy investment of your time?

   I'm always wondering about things like that.

   [What followed at this point of a summary of the questionnaire 
responses and dialogue about that.]

   Questions are very important. Every morning when you get up, you 
start your day with questions. At least this seems to be the case. 
Perhaps the first one is, "Is it really time to get up? Seems like I 
just went to sleep."

   Then they begin:

   "What am I going to wear?"
   "What's for breakfast?"
   "Will I be in time for the meeting?"
   "How am I going to get it all done today?"
   "Who will prepare supper tonight?"
   "How's the market doing?"

   Perhaps one of the things that differentiates is the quality of 
questions we ask ourselves.

   I want to read you the story of the most significant question you 
can ask - of yourself or of someone else.

   This is an old, old story. This version of it comes from Dawna 
Markova's wonderful book, "I Will Not Die an Unlived Life."

   Immediately after her father died, she realized that even in his own 
opinion, he had not really lived his life but merely existed. As part 
of her grieving, this poem came out of her -

   I will not die an unlived life.
   I will not live in fear
   of falling or catching fire.
   I choose to inhabit my days,
   To allow my living to open me,
   To make me less afraid,
   More accessible;
   To loosen my heart
   Until it becomes a wing,
   A torch, a promise.
   I choose to risk my significance,
   To live so that which came to be as seed
   Goes to the next as blossom,
   And that which came to me as blossom,
   Goes on as fruit.

   It is very important when you hear this story to hear it as a 
parable, a metaphor, about your inner life and living. If you want to 
pursue this more, read Robert Johnson's book "He." By the way, Robert 
Johnson's biography is out and I highly recommend it as supplementary 
reading to what these gatherings are all about. The title of that book 
is "Balancing Heaven and Earth." It will both inform and inspire you.

   Now, here is the story:

   "In the center of space and time, there lived a king in a castle. 
His name was Arthur, and he had been mortally wounded. Though his heart 
sill pumped blood, he never left his chamber, for he had fallen under 
an evil spell. He no longer cared a whit for the fortunes of his people 
or his lands. All of his kingdom lay fallow. Everyone's souls seemed to 
be suspended. The people went about their daily tasks lethargically, as 
if they were all in a trance of some kind. They had lost all sense of 
purpose.

   "The story now shifts to a cottage in the woods not far from the 
castle. A very naive, fatherless young man name Parsifal had just come 
of age. While walking through the forest, he encountered a bevy of the 
king's knights riding along the road. He was so awestruck by their 
shining appearance that he immediately wished to become one such as 
they. Over the objections of his very strict mother, Herzelaide, he set 
off for the castle.

   "Parsifal was struck dumb, however when he reached King Arthur's 
castle. Instead of the glorious Camelot he had expected, he found 
himself in the middle of a wasteland, where everything was sterile. He 
discovered that the king had been wounded in the groin, and had lost 
the power of re-generation. The King's courtiers, moving about 
listless, did nothing about the terrible situation that had befallen 
them.

   "Parsifal was given a horse and weapons so he could battle with a 
formidable knight who had bested all of Arthur's champions. 
Astonishingly, Parsifal won and took the armor of the fearsome foe. 
Some said it was mere luck, but the consensus was that the young man's 
innocence conferred a divine blessing on him.

   "Parsifal wanted desperately to help his king, but he, like everyone 
else, had no answers as to how to heal the wound. His mind was filled 
with questions, which flowed from the gift of his innocence, but he 
dammed them up, remembering his mother's constant injunction not to 
embarrass people by asking questions. And so Parsifal left the count on 
a quest for the Holy Grail.

   "The legend then relates how he ventured down many a blind path and 
false trail in his search, but finally he glimpsed the Grail and, as a 
result, felt the King's pain in his own heart. On the first of May, he 
rode his magnificent white charger back to Arthur's castle. He rushed 
to his king, who was at Death's door. With compassion in his heart, he 
overcame his previous hesitance and knelt beside his monarch. A 
question rose to his lips and spilled over as it were wine.

   "'What aileth thee?' A blinding light flashed, and in an instant the 
spell was broken. The king's heath was restored, the land and all its 
inhabitants were renewed. Arthur and the other members of the court 
turned to Parsifal and in honoring him, the King gave this toast, 'If 
you falter, never forget, that verily every day holds the promise of a 
new redemption!'"

   Questions can be dangerous. They can take you to and over the edge 
of the safe world we normally live in.

   "Is my spirit dying in my marriage?"
   "What is my life really about?"
   "Will I die an unlived life?"

   All new and original thought begins with a question.

   Can we embrace the unanswered? Can we live in the mystery?

   Here is a very important question for you to ask yourself:

   "What is likely to happen to me if I keep living my life exactly as 
I am?"

   And, then:

   "Is that what I want?"

   So here are two questions I leave with you:

   The first is by Meister Eckhart and was written several hundred 
years ago:

   "What good is it to me if Mary gave birth to the son of God fourteen 
hundred years ago and I do not give birth to the child of God in my 
time and in my culture? We are all meant to be mothers of God. For God 
is always needing to be born."

   The next question comes from Mother Teresa:

   "What do we live for if not to make life less difficult for each 
other?"

   The answers to these and other questions stirred in your today will, 
of course, have to come from you.

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember 
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Would you please email me the final bullets from last week.  I don't necessarily go look for the final copy since I am the one who combines all the bullets.

Hey, did we decide whether you were going to Florida with me in July?  The
meeting starts for me on Sunday, 7/14 and runs through Wednesday morning the
17th.

If you're interested, we could fly up on Thursday or Friday before and you
could fly out on Sunday the 14th.

This is apparently very close to Miami, so there may be someone we know that
we could visit.  I'm sending you a map via your hotmail account.

See if your job situation will permit you to go with me!

JW

California:

CPUC - Gov. Gray Davis has appointed Michael Peevey, former President of Southern California Edison as Commissioner at the CPUC to replace Com. Bilas who resigned last week.  Gov. Davis' appointment of Mr. Peevey was met with protests from consumer groups who see him as someone advocating deregulation and having a record of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers.  Mr. Peevey's appointment is subject to Senate approval.

I99-07-003  SoCal Unbundling.  Reviewed the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, Lorenz testimony in the System Adequacy proceeding and the Dec. 11th Unbundling Decision as to the treatment of receipt point capacity especially as related to the 50MM/d increase at Needles.  As discussed, the Lorenz testimony provides the best basis for allocating the 50MM/d to TW until the CSA provisions are implemented on Nov. 1, 2002.  

A01-10-011  PG&E Gas Accord II.  The ALJ in this case, John Wong, issued a ruling on which issues will be addressed and an initial schedule for the proceeding.  Issues to be addressed include:  Determining restriction requirements on bidders of relinquished and expansion capacity; How to handle relinquished  storage capacity (i.e. open season); How contracts will be handled to match up with PG&E's proposed GTrans' capacity in its POR; and open season procedures for relinquished and expansion capacity.  Direct testimony is due July 15, 2002 and Evidentary Hearings are set to begin August 5, 2002.

A01-09-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  On Monday, SoCal filed an amended BCAP filing to reflect the impact of unbundling the system.  Copies have been requested but not yet received for review.

Election Results -  In an upset, LA businessman Bill Simon won the Republican nomination by winning 49% of the vote compared to 30% of the voters favoring former LA Mayor Richard Riordan and 17% of the vote which went to Secretary of State, Bill Jones.  Simon will run against Gov. Davis in the fall elections for Governor.  Congressman Gary Condit was beaten by his former aide, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza.

New Mexico:

Legislative - As promised, Republican Gov. Gary Johnson vetoed this week the Legislatures latest budget proposal and vowed to keep the state running by using the previous year budget.  Democratic leaders of the Senate and House have proposed appointing a bipartisan group of lawmakers to explore whether a budget compromise can be reached with Gov. Johnson.  Johnson's Chief of Staff, David McCumber didn't reject the idea for the governor, but did raise some concerns about the approach.

Utility Case No. 3619 - The New Mexico PRC has issued proposed revisions to Rule 572 for Renewable Energy.  The Proposed revisions require all providers of electricity to increase their renewable energy portfolio such that they meet certain standards of renewable sources.   By Sept. 1, 2003 the portfolio standard will be 2%, by Sept. 1, 2005 it must be 5% and by Sept. 1 2007 renewable sources must be 10% of their energy portfolio.  Renewable sources are defined to include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal and biomass.

Sorry for the delay in response...I'm up to my ears in preparation for TW's new contracts/capacity release implementation.  I am available both Wednesday and Thursday afternoon.  Please let me know which is better for you.

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 11	
>From 5:00 p.m. - 6:00 a.m., the Envision team will perform hardware maintenance on the Envision system.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16

>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

Hi Kim,

Just a note to see if you are still there at Enron.

I have gotten many e-mails back, mostly the tech guys, including Vince.

But I don't remember having got e-mails back from you, so maybe you are
still there.

If so, I certainly wish you the best in whatever direction you
ultimately take.

Obviously, Transwestern is an important pipeline and will continue to
operate.

If we can be of help at any time in the future after the dust finally
settles, please let me know.

Stay in touch!

Thanks,

Bob Brooks

Earl and Mansoor,

I have received a copy of the as-built drawings for the TW/Agave Eddy County Interconnect.  Earl, as I understand it, you have a copy also.  Please confirm that you have what you need.  I will send my copy to Mansoor unless otherwise directed. 

Also, I have received an invoice from Agave for $245,904.20 for their work on this interconnect.  Earl, I believe Mark McConnell faxed you a copy a few weeks ago.  I need you both to approve the invoice so I can pay.  Do either of you have any comments regarding this invoice?  Does anyone else need to see it?  Please advise.

Thanks, Kim.

This shows that with a 350 Hp increase per unit, we would still not exceed operational Hp even in the winter.  We max out about 4500 Hp in the summer on a good day and this winter TW had a one-hour peak of 5500 Hp.  Adding 5500 + 350 Hp still is below the 5879 Hp rating for emissions.  I'm copying Larry to be sure that the assumption the air permit was issued for 5879 Hp is true.  I'll verify with Larry ASAP.

guys, the turbines at Bloomfield are site rated at 5879 HP.  Solar rates the three units at sea level for around 7000, but due to the elevation impacts on the units they are derated to the 5879 number.

Crude Oil Futures Down Slightly

    Crude oil futures for April delivery on the NYMEX slipped $0.12 
to $21.29 per barrel yesterday after the API reported that crude 
stocks rose 2.5 million barrels contradicting EIA data, which said 
that they dropped 2.5 million barrels. However, both agencies agree 
that stockpiles of gasoline and distillates both fell substantially 
for the week ended February 22nd. API data indicated a 2.5 million 
barrel decrease in distillate inventories, followed by the EIAs 
report of a 3 million barrel drop. The data was a little more 
disparate on gasoline inventories. The API says that a 2.1 million 
barrel decline took place, while the EIA has pegged the figure at a 
1.1 million barrel fall. An increase in fuel demand and refinery 
cutbacks have contributed to the dip in inventories. The EIA said 
that crude oil supplies dropped due to the export curbs instituted by 
OPEC and other producing countries. The agency said that the cuts are 
just now beginning to be reflected in the data because it takes a 
tanker 45 days travel from the Middle East to Western markets. 
Heating oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX gained 0.0021 to 
$0.5539 per gallon. March gasoline futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0108 
to $0.584 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for April 
delivery on the IPE were down $0.01 to $20.85 per barrel.

Amerada Hess Makes New Equatorial Guinea Discovery
  
   Amerada Hess has made another oil discovery offshore Equatorial 
Guinea, on holdings acquired with its purchase of Triton Energy last 
year. The Akom discovery, Hess's fourth since the discovery of the 
Ceiba field, has about 162 feet of net pay and is located on Block G 
of the Rio Muni basin, about 12 miles the Ceiba field. Hess has an 
85% stake in the find and is the operator of the block. Energy Africa 
of South Africa holds the rest. Last month, Hess reported the Ebano, 
located on Block F of the Rio Muni basin, had a gross pay of 300 feet 
of API gravity 36.5 degree oil. In December, Hess confirmed its Oveng 
oil discovery on Block G with an appraisal well that flowed over 
8,000 bpd of 34 degree oil.

Anadarko Riding Out Cyclical Downturn in Prices


    Anadarko may be one of the hardest hit by the cyclical nature the 
oil and natural gas business. Many integrated oil companies have 
other assets, like refineries, chemical plants, gasoline stations, to 
fall back on when oil and natural gas prices drop. Anadarko must 
continue to drill for new deposits to make money. Last year, 
Anadarko's net income slipped from $659 million, or $2.50 per share, 
in the 1st quarter to $108 million, or $0.41 per share, in the 4th 
quarter. In January, Anadarko restated its 3rd quarter earnings, 
taking a $1.08 billion charge for accounting errors involving its oil 
and natural gas reserves, turning what was a profit into a loss for 
2001. Anadarko reported a $188 million loss on sales of $8.4 billion 
for 2001. Since Anadarko's stock performance is tied to oil and 
natural gas prices, its share price rose to $72.99 per share last 
March. Since then, its stock has fallen about 35%, and some analysts 
have lowered it from a `strong buy' to `hold'. Many investors were 
attracted by its oil production, which grew at an average annual rate 
of 38% from 1996 to 2000. But the company has become big enough that 
it finds it difficult to maintain that type of growth. Anadarko is 
considering a repurchase of up to $900 million in stock and says that 
if the stock remains low, it may buy back large blocks. Anadarko's 
CEO says that it tries to ride the oil price cycle, which runs about 
3 years, by discovering oil and natural gas when the market is down 
and the cost of rigs is low, then pumping it when prices are high. 
Anadarko has cut its capital budget for 2002 by 39% to $2 billion. If 
energy prices remain low, the company may cut its budget further. So 
far, Anadarko has kept to a no-layoff policy that dates back to the 
company's inception. It has fields in Texas, Louisiana, the Rocky 
Mountains, Oklahoma, Alaska, western Canada, Algeria, Qatar, Egypt 
and Venezuela and is exploring off the coasts of West Africa and 
Australia.

Dispute Brews over Caspian Sea Oil


     A dispute between 5 countries that surround the Caspian Sea 
appears to be far from settled. The row is over the division of the 
Caspian's oil. Russia said it was optimistic that a settlement could 
be reached by the end of this year. In a move opposed by Iran, 
Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have signed bilateral agreements to 
develop oil and natural gas deposits on the Caspian shelf before the 
5 nations reached a settlement. Iran sent gunboats to chase off 2 of 
BP's ships last year. The ships were exploring waters claimed by Iran 
and Azerbaijan. Iran, the lone holdout insists that the sea should be 
split equally 5 ways. The former Soviet states, Russia, Kazakhstan, 
Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, appear to have accepted a split along 
median lines, which would leave Iran with less than 20%. That method 
divides the sea by extending lines from each country's coast and then 
assessing how much territory each should using the intersection of 
the lines. However, some say that Turkmenistan may not have accepted 
median lines because it could be put it at a territorial disadvantage 
to Azerbaijan, which is just across the sea.

Marathon $1 Billion in Debt Sale


    Marathon Oil plans to sell $1 billion of debt this week in a two-
part sale. Marathon expects to split the sale between 10-year notes 
and 30-year bonds. Details on the sale's pricing or exact timing are 
not yet available. Marathon's existing senior debt is rated `BBB+' by 
Standard and Poor's, the 3rd lowest investment grade. Marathon`s 4th 
quarter profits tumbled on lower crude oil and natural gas prices, 
but has announced a 3% increase in its 2002 capital, exploration, and 
investment budget.

Iraqi Oil Continues to Pour Into US


    In spite of being targeted as part of an `axis of evil' by 
President Bush, Iraqi's evil oil continues to pour into the US. 
According to EIA data, Iranian oil accounts for about 9% of the total 
oil imported by the US, which is the largest consumer of Iraqi crude. 
US companies imported about 790,000 bpd of Iraqi oil last year, with 
Valero and ChevronTexaco leading the way. Exxon Mobil, Marathon and 
Koch, which are next in line, imported only about half as much as 
Valero and ChevronTexaco. US imports of Iraqi oil climbed about 30% 
last year overall. Iraqi imports were notably heavier in the last 
half of the year, with the US receiving about 70% of Iraq's exports, 
despite a growing glut in US stockpiles as a result of a deepening 
recession and a sharp drop in airline traffic after September 11th. 
Iraq does not sell directly to the US, instead most of its oil is 
sold to Russian firms, then may be resold again before it eventually 
makes its way to the US. The administration's tough stance on Iraq 
has led to market concerns that Iraqi supplies could be disrupted. 
Under the UN's oil for food program, Iraq exports about 2.2 million 
bpd, but that figure can drop sharply due to political issues, moves 
by the UN to halt smuggling or especially during the renewal phase of 
the program. However, if Iraq did pull all of its exports off the 
market, OPEC members have committed to pick up the slack, if they 
can. The cartel has already cut about 5 million bpd from its exports 
in the last year in an attempt to stabilize oil prices. According to 
the EIA, Valero imported 151,800 bpd from Iraq, ChevronTexaco 
imported 130,600 bpd, followed by Exxon Mobil at 88,500 bpd, Koch at 
83,600 bpd and Marathon with 67,200 bpd.

A woman was sitting at a bar enjoying an after-work cocktail with
her girlfriends when an exceptionally tall, handsome, extremely
sexy young man entered. He was so striking that the woman could
not take her eyes away from him. The young man noticed her overly-attentive 
stare and walked directly toward her. Before she could
offer her apologies for being so rude for staring, the young man
said to her. "I'll do anything, absolutely anything,
that you want me to do, no matter how kinky, for $20. on one condition."

Flabbergasted, the woman asked what the condition was. The young man
replied, "You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words."

The woman considered his proposition for a moment, withdrew from
her purse and - slowly counted out four $5 bill, which she
pressed into the young man's hand along with her address. She
looked deeply into his eyes, and
s l o w l y, meaningfully said .......




"CLEAN MY HOUSE."

Due to the large number of moves recently, many locations and phones numbers are incorrect in Peoplefinder.  If your information is incorrect, our HR staff has sent the instructions below on how you can correct your data.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call us.

Mail stop - this is how your paycheck (if your pay method is hard copy) and other mail comes to you.  Updates should be e-mailed by the employee or a department administrative assistant to Kenneth Mathews along with the person's P number.  Here is a link to a mail stop listing so that you can choose the correct mail stop:

	http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp?cabinet_id=127   Select number 10. Mail Stop Listing.

Room Location - this is the room number that shows up in directories such as Peoplefinder.  Updates should be done by the each employee by logging in to eHRonline and choosing "Work Contact Information", make the change and save.

Work Address (street address) - this information is located on eHRonline under "Work Contact Information" but cannot be updated by employees; this address does not effect where you get your mail (the mail stop does).  However, it is being updated through HR by the ISC; it will be sometime next week before the ISC loads this information into SAP due to some other delays; this will change the address in eHRonline from 333 Clay to 1400 Smith

James:
Can we scale this down a bit?  As I mentioned to Kevin Hyatt yesterday, we just need a slimmed down version for them to get started with.  If this is not possible, we can send them this.  They are needing to review a model and run sensitivities for the returns.  Things like the MLP should be deleted.

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

XENERGY Press Release:

AUSTIN, Tx. (02/28/2002) - Over half of the electricity
purchased by large customers in Texas now comes from
competitive suppliers rather than the local utility, a panel
of Texas energy suppliers revealed Tuesday at an energy
forum sponsored by XENERGY in Austin.  At least 750,000
Texans will switch their electric suppliers by the end of
the year, predicted Texas Public Utility Commissioner Brett
Perlman.

These optimistic assessments were presented at XENERGY's
Thirteenth Executive Forum, held at Austin's Four Seasons
Hotel on February 26-27.  XENERGY is a national energy
consulting firm that has performed over $10 million of
research thus far on retail energy markets throughout the
country.

The forum featured a "who's who" list of speakers including
Texas Public Utility Commissioners Rebecca Klein and Brett
Perlman, Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) CEO
Thomas Noel, former Texas Senator David Sibley, New Power
Vice President Kathleen Magruder, Centrica Senior Vice
President Nick Fulford, Reliant Energy Solutions President
Jim Ajello and Sempra Energy Solutions President Robert
Dickerman, and XENERGY experts.

Labeling Texas deregulation a success thus far, Commissioner
Klein described the market as "healthy" and told attendees
that customers switching electric suppliers are already
seeing savings of up to 12%.  Residential switches are
likely to increase this spring and summer when the state
unfolds a multimillion dollar consumer education program.

XENERGY CEO Kelly Warner praised Texas for "continuing to
search for the promise that's inherent in deregulation" as
he opened the conference.  "All eyes are looking at Texas,"
Warner said, noting that Texas offers "one of the best
chances for competition to really work."

ERCOT CEO Thomas Noel told conference attendees that "This
is not a sprint --- this is a marathon." He referred to
electric deregulation as "a work in progress" but observed
that results to date are well ahead of most people's
expectations. He noted that "Texas is not California" with
regard to electric deregulation and also stated that Enron's
recent problems will not greatly impact the ERCOT market.

Former Senator Sibley, one of the main architects of Texas'
deregulation bill, noted the savings that consumers can
receive under the new law. "Residential customers must win
with deregulation or else it will be a failure," he said in
a luncheon address.  He indicated that if deregulation does
not succeed in Texas, it is not likely to succeed elsewhere.

New Power VP Kathleen Magruder stated, "Texas got the vast
majority of the rules right. Overall, we think the
deregulation program is a good one."  Centrica, Britain's
largest natural gas company (which also owns Energy
America), this week announced it would acquire New Power.
Centrica Senior VP Nick Fulford told forum attendees that
his company would bring scale and financial strength to New
Power while building brand recognition in North America.

The Austin forum was held in conjunction with XENERGY's
Retail Energy Markets (REM) 2001 study, a leading,
syndicated strategic information service for stakeholders in
restructured energy markets.  Authors of the REM study
announced that New Power, Reliant, TXU, and Green Mountain
currently hold the largest residential market share in
Texas, while TXU, Reliant, AES NewEnergy, Dynegy, Strategic
Energy, Calpine, First Choice, and Sempra are the leading
suppliers to large customers.

For more information on the Forum or XENERGY's REM 2001
Program, contact Bill Huss, Senior Vice President of
XENERGY, at (781) 273-5700 or bhuss@xenergy.com.

XENERGY is an energy consulting, information technology and
energy services firm headquartered in Burlington,
Massachusetts, with offices across the United States and in
Canada.  The company offers consulting services on a wide
range of energy issues, and works with utilities, energy
service companies, industrial and commercial customers,
institutions and government agencies.  Founded in 1975,
XENERGY is a wholly-owned subsidiary of KEMA Consulting.

I agree.  I hope that the first decision point, perhaps this week, answers
the "if" question.  Then, perhaps by the end of the month, if the answer to
"if" is "yes," we can then answer the "when" question.

I still think we're GO, but I heard Dorothy and Kim do the "it depends on
Enron" and Janell has the broken leg issue.  Hopefully it all works out
well.  We're not at the deadline yet but at some point we'll have to make a
call.

The first hurdle is the U of H accelerated Italian course in mid February
which I plan to attend unless we've aborted.  The real deadline is somewhere
around D-30 days when the air fare/schedule becomes harder to get.

One suggestion.  In Section III, given the reference to all dockets in the related filing, the second sentence should be changed to read:
These applications seek, among other requests, to extend PG&E's existing intrastate. . . .

Energy and Power Consumers and Producers? 

Are you a consumer that hesitated to buy forward in 2000 or bought too soon last year?  Are you a producer who hedged too early in 2000 and did not hedge enough in early 2001?

Hey, Kim-
I tried to call you today (I was out sick yesterday - respiratory crud) but your voice mail didn't ever pick up.  I'm ok, just working myself out of a job pretty quickly.  Hope you are well.

Glad to hear you guys are surviving Taylor's treks.  Perhaps some sort of reverse proximity alarm should be invented...you know, one that 
would go off when she strays more than 10 feet from one of you.  The patent might pay for a few dive trips!  

No news is good news on the Enron front.  Transwestern still not in bankruptcy, is making money, business as usual for Kim.  Our 
remaining "strategic investment" in several thousand shares of the big E remains speculative, but at this point, who cares?

How do you guys look for dinner Saturday night?  We could bring something over to grill at your place (our community grill is still out of 
commission from the flood, and is not high on the replacement list), or we could meet somewhere, whatever is best for you parent-types. 

See you soon...

John

While recent events have dramatically impacted Enron's travel volume,
Alliance Worldwide (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) wanted to contact
you regarding the Enron Travel Program.  Since 1984, our company has been a
strategic business partner with Enron and has provided a complete scope of
services from booking, ticketing, ticket delivery, customer service,
reporting, management of ClickTrip, to facilitating preferred vendor
arrangements with airlines to benefit Enron.    These services have been
provided on a management fee basis from Alliance to Enron.  As of December
1, 2001 the management fee has been suspended during Enron's period of
reorganization.  We are continuing to provide the turnkey travel services to
Enron and forego the management fee and simply charge a time of ticketing
fee per ticket.  

To provide you with a brief history of our arrangement, Enron and Alliance
approached the airlines a couple years ago and negotiated deep upfront
discounts for Enron's business travel.  These discounts are available only
through Alliance and are given at time of ticketing.  All commissions were
stripped from the price of the discounted ticket and returned to Enron, in
exchange for Enron paying Alliance a contracted management fee.  This
management fee was paid monthly and allocated back to each Enron cost center
based on the total number of transactions.  This travel program provided
Enron over $8.6 million in airline savings on $55 million spent in the year
2000 and over $5.2 million on $33 million spent for the first 3 quarters of
2001.  These savings are after the payment of the travel agency management
fee.    

The effect that the reduced travel volume will have on discounts provided by
the airlines cannot yet be determined.  We have contacted the airline
companies and most of Enron's preferred carriers have agreed to extend the
contracts through April 2002.  You may utilize these discounts through
Alliance by calling 713 650-8080 or 1 800 962-0248.  In March, Enron and
Alliance will begin evaluating Enron's volume and travel patterns, and
determine any changes that are to be made to the discounts or fee structure.


As mentioned earlier, Alliance is implementing a time of ticketing fee in
lieu of a management fee.  These fees are reimbursable to Enron employees
through normal expense report procedures.  Specifically, the new fee
structure is based on zero-commission contracts for tickets purchased from
Enron's preferred carriers.  The fee schedule for all airline tickets for
Enron travel is as follows:

$30 - Domestic tickets with or without upfront discount
$30 - International tickets without upfront discount
25% of Savings, capped at $175 - International tickets with upfront discount
$15 - Southwest Airlines and ClickTrip Reservations, Hotel/Car Only Bookings

The savings to Enron on a per ticket basis more than covers the nominal fees
that are charged.  For example, Enron's average ticket prices are $589
domestic and $2207 international (after discounts). Enron's average savings
are $144 domestic and $587 international (before fees).  The savings are
more than three times the per ticket fee!

If you are accustomed to booking your own travel online, you may continue to
do so by booking through ClickTrip.  ClickTrip is the only online booking
tool that allows access to Enron's negotiated discounts.  Ticketing through
ClickTrip also bears a smaller fee of $15 if no agent assistance is
necessary.  There is no charge to look at schedules.   ClickTrip is
available 24 hours a day and may be accessed through Enron's intranet site
<http://travel.enron.com> or via the Internet site
<http://www.resassist.com/enron/>.  ClickTrip is also a useful tool for
checking flight schedules or for checking upgrade status.  To check upgrade
status or to review a ticketed itinerary, simply click the Check My Trip
button on the ClickTrip home page and fill in your name and Amadeus locator
number (provided at the top of your itinerary).  A user log-in may be
obtained by contacting Alliance at 713 328-5100.

If your office location, phone number or any profile information has
changed, please notify us by return email.  A profile form is attached if
you prefer to fax the information to Alliance at 713 328-5600 or if you are
a new traveler wishing to set up a profile.

We at Alliance are proud of our 17 year association with Enron and dedicated
to ensuring you of the best possible service at the most economical price
for all of your travel needs.  We have a highly trained and experienced
staff working on Enron's account and we look forward to providing you with
continued service for years to come.  
If you have any questions regarding any of the changes mentioned, or wish to
discuss specific details relating to your corporate travel policies, please
call me 713 328-5139, or email lhinson@allianceworldwide.com

NEW MEXICO
LEGISLATIVE STATUS REPORT

			 The Second Regular Session of New Mexico's 45th
Legislature ended at noon on Thursday, February 14 (Valentine's Day?), and
the final disposition by the Legislature of the monitored bills that would
specifically affect our industry is as follows:

			CS/H 165-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Representative Ben Lujan, Dem., Dist. 46 (Santa Fe). A House
Taxation & Revenue Committee substitute bill received a "Do Pass," was
passed by the House and was sent to the Senate, where it was referred to but
withdrawn from the Senate Conservation and Finance Committees, passed by the
Senate and sent to the Governor. This substitute bill would provide that one
liable for the oil and gas emergency school tax on production from Jicarilla
Apache tribal land will have a credit each month equal to the lesser of the
tax that is exclusively dedicated to fund capital improvement projects on
the Jicarilla Apache tribal land (but not commercial buildings) imposed on
such production by the Jicarilla Apache Nation, or 0.7% of the taxable value
of such production. The burden of showing entitlement to this credit would
be on the taxpayer, who must furnish proof of payment of the Jicarilla
Apache tribal capital improvements tax. 

			HB 230-"Indian Country" Defined: Introduced by
Representative Leo C. Watchman, Jr., Dem., Dist. 9 (McKinley & San Juan).

Introduced by Representative Nick Tinnin, Rep., Dist. 1 (San Juan). Would
appropriate $300,000 to San Juan College for Fiscal Year 2003 and subsequent
years for an oil and gas field training program at the college that includes
certification and training for well, pipeline and drilling technicians and
field workers. This bill was received a "Do Pass" in the House Business &
Industry Committee and was sent to the House Appropriations & Finance

sent to the House Taxation & Revenue Committee, where, as amended, it
received a "Do Pass." It was passed by the House and sent to the Senate,
where it was referred to the Senate Finance Committee, where it received a
"Do Pass." Then, it was passed by the Senate and sent to the Governor. This
substitute bill, as amended, would provide that a refinery, natural gas
processor or person who operates an oil or gas well who produces water from
oil or gas drilling and production from a depth of 2,500 feet or more below
the surface or refining crude oil or processing natural gas may take an
income tax credit of $1,000 per acre-foot of produced water (not to exceed
$400,000 per year) if the party delivers the water to the Interstate Stream
Commission at the Pecos River in compliance with the New Mexico Water
Quality Act, to contribute to delivery obligations pursuant to the Pecos
River Compact, and subject to other conditions, and that the Interstate
Stream Commission shall indemnify the party from future liability.

a study by the Lea and Carlsbad Soil and Water Conservation Districts of
issues related to the use of water produced by oil and gas exploration from
"deep underground." This bill was found germane by the Senate Committees'
Committee, received a "Do Pass" in the Senate Conservation Committee, and
was sent to the Senate Finance Committee,  where it died.

			SB 283-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Senator Leonard Tsosie, Dem., Dist 37 (Dona Ana, Otero &
Sierra). This bill is identical to HB 165, was found germane by the Senate
Committees' Committee, and was sent to the Senate Indian & Cultural Affairs,
where it was withdrawn and sent directly to the Senate Finance Committee,
where it died.

			SB 345-Well Workover Projects: Introduced by Senator
Leonard Lee Rawson, Rep., Dist. 37 (Dona Ana, Otero & Sierra). Would amend
the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Production Incentive Act to expand the
definition of "well workover project" to include the installation by the
operator of workover equipment that is intended to substantially increase
the life of the well and that has been approved and certified by the OCD,
which approval shall be granted if the OCD determines that the equipment
will substantially reduce operating costs, thereby increasing the life of
the well and its recoverable reserves. This bill was found germane by the
Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the Senate Conservation Committee,
where it received a "Do Pass" and was sent to the Senate Finance Committee,
where it received a "Do Pass," but it died in the Senate.

Commission to apply for funding from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety
in the Department of Transportation, for authority to carry out a safety
program on interstate gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities and to
become an agent of the federal Secretary of Transportation in regard to such
facilities issues, and work to protect the safety of New Mexico residents
and visitors by developing a rigorous pipeline safety program and taking
action to prevent future pipeline accidents. This memorial was referred to
the House Energy & Natural Resources Committee, where it received a "Do
Pass, and it was passed by the House. 

			HJM 17-Coordinated Oil & Gas Permitting Process:
Introduced by Representative Patricia A. Lundstrom, Dem., Dist. 5
(McKinley). Would request that the Department of Environment, the Oil
Conservation Division and the federal Bureau of Land Management cooperate in
the development of a coordinated permit process for oil and gas activities.
This memorial received a "Do Pass" in the House Energy & Natural Resources
and Business & Industry Committees, was passed by the House, and was sent to
the Senate, where it was referred to the Senate Conservation Committee,
withdrawn and died. 

			SJM 83-Treat Produced Water For Recycling: Also
introduced by Senator Leavell. Would request that the State Engineer, the
OCD, representatives of the oil and gas industry and the Department of
Environment jointly study the issues raised by the potential for treating
produced water so that it may be put to beneficial use and report their
findings and recommendations to the appropriate legislative committee by
December 1, 2002. This memorial was referred to the Senate Rules and
Conservation Committees, but it died in the former.

- Thomas Noel, CEO, Electric Reliability Council of Texas
- Jim Ajello, President, Reliant Energy Solutions
- Carol Biedrzycki, Executive Director, Texas ROSE
- Brett Perlman, Commissioner, Public Utility Commission of
Texas
and more.

Don't miss you chance to participate in this landmark event.
Space is limited so be sure to register today.

For the current agenda or to register on-line, go to
http://www.xenergy.com/austin or call Kerin Seward at
1-800-892-2006, x:256.

_________________________________________________

Texas story...

XENERGY will soon publish The Texas Market LiftOff, the most
timely, comprehensive market intelligence available
including:

I checked the e-mail that went out for "girls' weekend", and Amy Gold
was first on the list.  I don't think I've heard back from her -- or, if I 
have, her name didn't make it to the rsvp'd list.

So find out if she's coming.  I'll put Sam down as "no".

J.

Subject:	TW Question in Amarillo

This is just to follow up on the phone message I left for you today (Friday, March 1).

The questions raised in the employee meeting with Stan Horton in Amarillo this week regarding gas that has gone off the system, had to do with NNG facilities not TW.
 As I stated in the voice mail, we do have an issue at the Ivanhoe station.  The HP there has not run in several years, but as long as it's in place, we are required to maintain the ESD system.  We would like to pursue the abandonment in place of the units.  If we don't do this, we are looking at some significant costs to make repairs and upgrades to the system.  Our question is, who do we need to work with on this effort?

Thanks for following up so quickly after Stan's visit.
Randy

We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. 

At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of "safety net" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.

The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under "ETS HR Manuals". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . 

I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

we will cancel these weekly meetings until we get some marketing contracts signed.  Any updates will be taken care of via weekly reports or in Steve Harris' weekly staff meeting.

By now you've probably heard that Kinder-Morgan shelved their Sonoran project.

Susan, please cancel any conf room reservation.

Ron you are correct.  The permitted horsepower forBloomfield is 5879.  We cant go over this value....without submitting a notification to the State of New Mexico and waiting for their approval....

This shows that with a 350 Hp increase per unit, we would still not exceed operational Hp even in the winter.  We max out about 4500 Hp in the summer on a good day and this winter TW had a one-hour peak of 5500 Hp.  Adding 5500 + 350 Hp still is below the 5879 Hp rating for emissions.  I'm copying Larry to be sure that the assumption the air permit was issued for 5879 Hp is true.  I'll verify with Larry ASAP.

guys, the turbines at Bloomfield are site rated at 5879 HP.  Solar rates the three units at sea level for around 7000, but due to the elevation impacts on the units they are derated to the 5879 number.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of February 3, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks ?

   First of all thanks to all of you who responded to the need for
financial help in our medical work in Bolivia. I can't recall
experiencing such generosity. We are going to be able to give them more
than they requested. Plus, several people are already on the list to go
down with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange
getting medical supplies to the clinic. Wow! Thanks.

   The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to "the
truth" and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious
and spiritual well being. We have become "fact fundamentalists." I also
deal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing
with terrorism. The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from
Ethiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood.

   What follows is a full text of the presentation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Is The Story You're Telling With Your Life the Truth?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist
complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked
how long it took him to catch them.

   "Not very long," answered the Mexican.

   "But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?" asked the
American.

   The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet
his needs and those of his family.

   The American asked, "But what do you do with the rest of your time?"

   "I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a
siesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my
friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs. I
have a full life."

   The American interrupted, "I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help
you!

   "You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the
extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger
boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a
second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of
trawlers.

   "Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can negotiate
directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant.
You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los
Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge
enterprise."

   "How long would that take?" asked the Mexican.

   "Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years," replied the American.

   "And after that?"

   "Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting," answered the
American, laughing. "When your business gets really big, you can start
selling stocks and make millions!"

   "Millions? Really? And after that?"

   "After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near
the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take
a siesta, and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends!"

   Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a
wonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about.

   I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase
"Journey Into Wholeness." It is so easy for those of us in the West to
think that that journey is out there somewhere, in the outer world. The
goal of spiritual work is to become a "self." Or, to become aware of
the Self. I can't adequately explain to you what this self is. It is
the center and, at the same time, the circumference of the personality.
It embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness. The Self is known
as the Christ in Christianity.

   Journey into Wholeness. The root meaning of the word "holiness" is
this wholeness. Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the
faculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a
dignified place in our personality. Usually for those of us in the
Western world our need, as reflected in the story of the Mexican
fisherman, is relatedness; relatedness to ourselves as well as to
others. This is the principle of equality I've spoken to you about so
often. We who speak English are limited to one word for "love." In
Sanskrit there are ninety-six words for love. We are highly specialized
in technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings.

   Jesus, and other Eastern spiritual teachers, saw the outer world to
be of little importance. The place where the kingdom of God was was
inside and among us. For us, however, reality is in the outer,
material, physical world. One of the ways this has affected Christian
theology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique, so
distinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death.
The religion out of which we came, Judaism, thought that after death
what happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the
sunrise. Yes, it has individuality while it exists as a separate
entity, but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great
primal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality. Does a drop of
water cease to exist when it falls back into the sea? Well, yes and no.
Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more. Jesus knew that the
ego was a great troublemaker for us.

   We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals. To
threaten this notion of who we are is hell. We protect what we call our
individuality at all costs. Death is bearable only if we are guaranteed
a life after death containing all the characteristics of our individual
human life.

   You can see how this would affect the way we go about living our
lives and making choices about who we are and what are we to do. Those
were the questions that shaped, by the way, what became our Bible.
After every great cultural upheaval the community of people raised the
questions: Who are we and what are we to do?

   e.e. cummings once wrote, "To be yourself in a world that is doing
its best to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle
any human being can fight, and never stop fighting."

   I love the story of the Pentecostal man who wandered into, let us
say, a Methodist church. During the sermon, the visitor got so excited
that whenever the preacher made a point, the Pentecostal man would
scream out, "Praise God!" or "Hallelujah!" or "Amen!" The ushers were
so distraught about the Pentecostal's behavior that the head usher went
down the aisle and whispered to him: "You'll have to keep quiet? The
pastor's right in the middle of the sermon!" The Pentecostal man said,
"Keep quiet? How can I keep quiet? I've got the Holy Spirit!" To which
the usher said, "Well, you didn't get it in this church!"

   The Pentecostal man made a theological error that many of us make.
You see, he didn't have the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit had him! And
that's the problem with much of our theology. We wish he had the Holy
Spirit. There's a part of us that wishes we could keep the Holy Spirit
in the nice, neat, tidy confines of our categories and barriers. We'd
like to put God in a box.

   Get this: Nobody has the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit always has us
and, given our Western orientation, that scares us so that we resist
and repress and deny until we are spiritual dead as doornails. We want
a God in a box like we want everything else in our lives predictable
and controllable. We want a religion that is safe. A journey that is
predictable. There is no true spiritual journey that is that way.

   We modern people have been victimized by own modernity. Of course,
we've benefited - we have the sciences, technology, modern medicine,
even emphases on human rights come from our modern approach to things.
But it has had two deeply destructive effects on our religious and
spiritual life.

   For one thing it has made people skeptical about spiritual reality.
If God can't be proved by modern means, then God must not be.

   Second, modernity has led us to be preoccupied with factuality -
with scientifically verifiable and historically reliable facts. Modern
Western culture is the only culture in human history that has
identified truth with factuality. We are, as Marcus Borg calls us,
"fact fundamentalists." If a statement isn't scientifically or
historically factual, it isn't true. These two things are serious
mistakes and deadly to the journey inward.

   Let me point out that both liberals and conservatives can be fact
fundamentalists. Liberals try to rescue a few facts from the fire.
Conservatives say the Bible must be factually true in order to be true
at all. This is why they emphasize the literal and historical
factuality of biblical texts. They both agree - facts are what matters.

   If I had a magic wand that worked, one of the things I would do is
to get both liberals and conservatives alike to see how modern both of
these positions are.

   What we've got when it comes to having faith today for most people
is whether they can believe "iffy" things or not. That, to most people,
is what Christianity has become. It is as if what God wants most from
us is believing highly problematic statements to be factually true.
And, if you can't believe them, then you don't "have faith" and
probably aren't a Christian.

   Listen carefully: Faith has to do with your relation to God, to
Self. Not whether you believe the Bible to be true or not.

   I'm going to come back to this in the weeks ahead.

   Let me see if I can give you an example. One of the questions that
has persistently come up in the discussion group has to do with what
Jesus' view on violence might be. This has been raised since the events
of 9/11. What would Jesus have us do? Does professing to be Christian
mean trying to live as Christ might live? And if so, why aren't we
doing what he asks us to do?

   First of all, I confess I have not a clue what Jesus would do in
response to 9/11. My hunch is not much. His interest was not in that
sort of thing. Besides, he had little political power.

   If we went to him and asked, I think he would probably tell a story.
He might tell the story of the Good Iranian Terrorist. That's what the
parable of the Good Samaritan sounded like to the people of his time.

   "Who are you he might ask?" Then tell a story to us as we stand
there with our mouths open and scratching our heads.

   Maybe he would tell a story like this:

   One day a rabbi, in a frenzy of religious passion, rushed in before
the ark, fell to his knees, and started beating his breast, crying,
"I'm nobody! I'm nobody!" The cantor of the synagogue, impressed by
this example of spiritual humility, joined the rabbi on his knees. "I'm
nobody!  I'm nobody!" The custodian, watching from the corner, couldn't
restrain himself, either. He joined the other two on his knees, calling
out, "I'm nobody! I'm nobody!" At which point the rabbi, nudging the
cantor with his elbow, pointed at the custodian and said, "Look who
thinks he's nobody!"

   I'll tell you something that might be misunderstood. I think that
one of the numbers that organized religion has done on us is to
convince us that we are supposed to be like Jesus. What God is
interested in is saving human beings. That being the case what we must
do is be human. The Christian conspiracy, I'm going to call it, against
being human is to convince us that what we are supposed to do is be
like Jesus.

   A couple of years ago there was a popular slogan: WWJD. The goal was
to ask before doing any and everything, "What would Jesus do?"

   If Jesus were here today, would he have worked for Enron? Would he
have been on the board of directors? If Jesus were here today, would he
go to church? Which one? The image that I had of Jesus when I grew up
was that Jesus would not go to movies on Sunday but he would go
swimming because we had a lot of water in our town. Would he be a
Republican or a Democrat? Would he be involved in the political
process?

   The one thing that Jesus Christ was about was love and he did this
by the extravagant way that he lived his life. He wasn't married; he
didn't hold down a job; he didn't have to raise kids. The Roman church
has it that Jesus was such a guy that not only did he not have a sexual
dimension, neither did his mother.

   What Jesus was about - and still is - is Love. The extravagant way
that Jesus lived his life was to communicate the overwhelming love that
God has for us. Boundless love. Inexpressible love. It is like God
comes down and puts arms around us and says, "This is how much I love
you. Now love yourself like that." This was the thing that marked the
ministry of Jesus. So Soren Kierkegaard writes, "To will to be that
self which one truly is, is the opposite of despair."

   How do you do that? Well, to be the self you truly are is to have a
particular history and it is to aspire to go beyond the limitations of
that history and it is to be frustrated when you realize you can't. To
accept this humanness means to be passionate about our aspirations and
compassionate about our limitations. It is like you get up from where
you're sitting and come up here and stand beside me physically and look
at the person who is seated in the chair where you are and you have
compassion for that person. It is that kind of acceptance.

   We are not to be like Jesus. We are to be Christ-like. There is a
world of difference.

   Jesus went around kicking self-esteem into people. All of the
stories that you find in the New Testament are like that. Look at the
stories of his ministry. If a man can restore sight to a blind man, he
gives that person a new lease on life, a new self-confidence. If a man
can absolve a prostitute's guilt in lasting forgiveness, he gives her
the gift of self-respect. The crippled, the insane, the leper, the tax
collector, the beggar - a motley assortment of humanity desperately in
need of self-esteem and he extended it to them.

   The same dynamic was at work even when he was chasing the
moneychangers out of the temple. It may be temporarily embarrassing to
be kicked out of your accustomed place of business, but it has been
known to lead to self-respect. The message is: You're made for
something better than this. You are loved by God. This self-compassion
is foundational for the abundant life and I'm sure that the response
Jesus would have us make to the terrorist situation as well as the rest
of life is this kind of love.

   He would tell a story. One of his central teachings was: You shall
know the Truth and the Truth shall set you free. (But first it's going
to mess with your life and upset you!) So, let me tell you a story
about Truth to ponder. This story is from the Ethiopian culture.

   Long ago, Fire, Water, Truth, and Falsehood lived together in one
large house. Although all were polite toward each other, they kept
their distance. Truth and Falsehood sat on opposite sides of the room.
Fire constantly leapt out of Water's path.

   One day they went hunting together. They found a large number of
cattle and began driving them home to their village. "Let us share
these cattle equally," said Truth as they traveled across the
grasslands. "This is the fair way to divine our captives."

   No one disagreed with Truth except Falsehood. Falsehood wanted more
than an equal share but kept quiet about it for the moment. As the four
hunters traveled back to the Village, Falsehood went secretly to Water
and whispered, "You are more powerful than Fire. Destroy Fire and then
there will be more cattle for each of us!"

   Water flowed over Fire, bubbling and steaming until Fire was gone.
Water meandered along, cheerfully thinking about more cattle for
itself.

   Falsehood, meanwhile, whispered to Truth. "Look! See for yourself!
Water has killed Fire! Let us leave Water, who has cruelly destroyed
our warmhearted friend. We must take the cattle high in the mountains
to graze."

   As Truth and Falsehood traveled up the mountain, Water tried to
follow. But the mountain was too steep; And Water could not flow
upwards. Water washed down upon itself, splashing and swirling around
rocks as it tumbled down the slope. Look and see! Water is still
tumbling down the mountainside to this day.

   Truth and Falsehood arrived at the mountaintop. Falsehood turned to
Truth and said in a loud voice, "I am more powerful than you! You will
be my servant. I am your master. All the cattle belong to me!"

   Truth rose up and spoke out, "I will not be your servant!"

   They battled and battled. Finally they brought the argument to Wind
to decide who was the master.

   Wind didn't know. Wind blew all over the world to ask people whether
Truth or Falsehood was more powerful. Some people said, "A single word
of Falsehood can completely destroy Truth." Others insisted, "Like a
small candle in the dark, Truth can change every situation."

   Wind finally returned to the mountain and said, "I have seen that
Falsehood is very powerful. But it can rule only where Truth has
stopped struggling to be heard."

   And it has been that way ever since.

   I think what Jesus would do if we asked him what we are to do is
that he would likely tell a story. And then he would remind us that we
ourselves are telling a story with our lives. After saying that,
perhaps he would ask, "Is the story you are telling with your life the
truth?"

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember
this: You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

NEW MEXICO
LEGISLATIVE STATUS REPORT

			 The following bills that may be of interest to our
members have been introduced in the Second Regular Session of New Mexico's
45th Legislature, which bills will be monitored during the Session, as I
will continue to watch for any other developments that might specifically
affect our industry:

			HB 165-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Representative Ben Lujan, Dem., Dist. 46 (Santa Fe). Would
provide that one liable for the oil and gas severance tax, conservation tax
or emergency school tax on production from Indian tribal land will have a
credit each month equal to the lesser of the tax that is exclusively
dedicated to fund capital improvement projects on the tribal land (but not
commercial buildings) imposed on such production by the Indian tribe, or 2%
of the taxable value of such production. The burden of showing entitlement
to this credit would be on the taxpayer, who must furnish proof of payment
of the tribal tax. This bill received a "Do Pass" in the House Energy &
Natural Resources Committee and was sent to the House Taxation & Revenue
Committee, where a hearing will be held on Monday, February 4, at 1:30 PM.

			HB 230-"Indian Country" Defined: Introduced by
Representative Leo C. Watchman, Jr., Dem., Dist. 9 (McKinley & San Juan).
Would broadly define "Indian country" under the New Mexico statutes. This
bill was referred to the House Rules & Order of Business Committee, where a
hearing will be held on Saturday, February 2, at 1:30 PM.

			HB 309-San Juan Oil and Gas Field Training Program:
Introduced by Representative Nick Tinnin, Rep., Dist. 1 (San Juan). Would
appropriate $300,000 to San Juan College for Fiscal Year 2003 and subsequent
years for an oil and gas field training program at the college that includes
certification and training for well, pipeline and drilling technicians and
field workers. This bill was referred to the House Business & Industry and
Appropriations & Finance Committees.

			HB 388-Tax Credit For Produced Water: Introduced by
Representative Robert W. Burpo, Rep., Dist. 23 (Bernalillo). Would provide
that a taxpayer who produces water from a depth of 3,000 feet or more below
the surface in the course of drilling for oil and gas may take an income tax
credit of $1,000 per acre-foot of produced water (not to exceed $400,000 per
year) if the taxpayer discharges the water into the Pecos River in
compliance with the New Mexico Water Quality Act, and subject to other
conditions. This bill was referred to the House Business & Industry and
Taxation & Revenue Committees.

			HB 423-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Introduced by Representative Donald L Whitaker, Dem., Dist. 61 (Lea).
This bill is identical to SB 369 and was referred to the House Energy &
Natural Resources and Appropriations & Finance Committees. 

			SB  16-Lea and Carlsbad Conservation District Study:
Introduced by Senator Carroll H. Leavell, Rep., Dist. 41 (Eddy & Lea). Would
appropriate $500,000 to New Mexico State University for Fiscal Year 2003 for
a study by the Lea and Carlsbad Soil and Water Conservation Districts of
issues related to the use of water produced by oil and gas exploration from
"deep underground." This bill was found germane by the Senate Committees'
Committee , received a "Do Pass" in the Senate Conservation Committee, and
was sent to the Senate Finance Committee,  where it was temporarily tabled.

			SB 283-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Senator Leonard Tsosie, Dem., Dist 37 (Dona Ana, Otero &
Sierra). This bill is identical to HB 165, was found germane by the Senate
Committees' Committee, and was sent to the Senate Indian & Cultural Affairs,
Conservation and Finance Committees.

			SB 345-Well Workover Projects: Introduced by Senator
Leonard Lee Rawson, Rep., Dist. 37 (Dona Ana, Otero & Sierra). Would amend
the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Production Incentive Act to expand the
definition of "well workover project" to include the installation by the
operator of workover equipment that is intended to substantially increase
the life of the well and that has been approved and certified by the OCD,
which approval shall be granted if the OCD determines that the equipment
will substantially reduce operating costs, thereby increasing the life of
the well and its recoverable reserves. This bill was found germane by the
Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the Senate Conservation and Finance
Committees.

			SB 369-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Also introduced by Senator Leavell. Would require the Legislative
Council to assign an Interim Committee to study the economic feasibility and
the costs and benefits of financing, constructing and operating a natural
gas pipeline to transport New Mexico natural gas to additional markets. This
bill was found germane by the Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the
Senate Conservation and Finance Committee. 

			HJM 17-Coordinated Oil & Gas Permitting Process:
Introduced by Representative Patricia A. Lundstrom, Dem., Dist. 5
(McKinley). Would request that the Department of Environment, the Oil
Conservation Division and the federal Bureau of Land Management cooperate in
the development of a coordinated permit process for oil and gas activities.
This bill received a "Do Pass" in the House Energy & Natural Resources
Committee and was sent to the House Business & Industry Committee.

			I will continue to keep you posted concerning any
changes or additional issues.

Energy and Power Consumers and Producers? 

Are you a consumer that hesitated to buy forward in 2000 or bought too soon last year?  Are you a producer who hedged too early in 2000 and did not hedge enough in early 2001?

Gary,

We just received this information regarding our new corporate expense card.  I'm not sure I see any benefits by getting one of the new Wright Travel Cards vs. using the EFCU.  Would you please look this over and let me know your thoughts.  If I choose to stay with the EFCU, I would probably like to get  a different card from the current EFCU Master Card so that I can keep my business and personal charges separate.  

Can you provide me your thoughts?

Thanks, Kim.

To:	DL-GA-all_ets
Subject:	Message from Morris Brassfield - ETS Travel and Entertainment Card Announcement

I am pleased to announce completion of negotiations with Wright Express to provide a travel and entertainment program for Enron Operations Services Company.   Travel and entertainment cards will be provided to any individual employed by the pipeline companies, who is required to travel on company business.   Each employee will be required to complete the attached application and agreement form, secure management approval and fax to Mary Ann Johnson at (713) 345-3479.   The T&E card will be mailed directly to the applicant. 

Implementation
Employees may use the T&E cards for domestic and international business travel.  Monthly, each employee will be required to complete an expense report utilizing the XMS system, if expenses are incurred.  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .    Approved business travel expenses will be reimbursed to the employee via direct deposit or check, depending on how your payroll is currently processed.  Personal use of the card is discouraged.

The Wright Express travel and entertainment card has contingent liability, whereas, the employee's personal credit may be evaluated if:
*	Outstanding balances exceeding $3,500 or delinquent payments beyond 25 days past the due date.
*	A monthly line of credit for business travel exceeding $3,500.

Employees who are required to travel on Company business and expect to exceed the monthly $3,500 spending limit, may request a higher limit.  If you routinely require a spending limit exceeding $3,500 per month, please check the box under "Company Information" on the attached application form.  Your request will be submitted to Enron Operations Service Management and Wright Express for approval.  You will be notified of approval or denial concerning your request.
	
All travel and entertainment MasterCard accounts are due each month to Wright Express.  Failure, by the employee to pay Wright Express each month, submit expense reports or submit receipts may trigger card cancellation.

Procedure
The travel and entertainment procedure can be found on the ETS website at http://www.ets.enron.com/pandSM/Employees will be responsible to review this procedure and comply with all requirements.  Following receipt of the signed, approved application and employee agreement form, employees should expect to receive a T&E credit card within ten to fifteen working days, but no later than March 15, 2002.

Card Activation:
Upon receipt of the travel and entertainment card, you will be required to follow the instructions on the sticker using the activation call-in number.  Following activation, you may immediately begin to use your T&E card.

Rewards Program
Wright Express travel card holders may participate in a rewards program, which is outlined in an attached document.  All fees charged by Wright Express for the rewards program is the employee's personal responsibility. 

Please address all questions concerning the travel and entertainment program to Bruce Martin 713-345-1833, Cheri Sublet 713-345-3475, Mary Ann Johnson 713-345-3479 or Morris Brassfield 713-646-7006.

Lindy,

Natural Gas Futures Rally Driven by Fund Buying  


    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX, driven by a 
fund buying rally, jumped well above key resistance levels and 
settled up $0.191 at $2.397 per MMBtu. The April contract gained 
$0.17 to $2.427 per MMBtu. The market opened up at $2.28 and 
continued to run higher as fund buying hit buy-stops for March at 
$2.345, jumped up to $2.38 and bounced between $2.38-$2.40 until the 
close. Look for the market to continue higher this morning ahead of 
the AGA storage report, perhaps into the $2.50s. A new bullish, below-
normal weather forecast for next week was enough to trigger the 
additional fund buying. Expectations are for a withdrawal of about 
110 ? 120 Bcf. A year ago, the AGA reported a 81 Bcf draw. Estimated 
volume yesterday was about 111,000 contracts, with 45,000 of those 
spreads. The market continues to carry a very high $0.92 forward 
difference between March and January 2003. Natural gas for next day 
delivery across the US and Canada was generally  $0.05 ? $0.15 higher 
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained 
$0.13 to $2.32 per MMBtu.

 JP Morgan Chase Sued Over Enron Exposure 

JP Morgan Chase was sued by shareholders who accuse the bank of 
failing to disclose the amount of money at stake because of exposure 
to Enron. A law firm has filed a class action suit on behalf of 
shareholders who purchased JP Morgan Chase shares between November 
28th and January 28th. Shares of JP Morgan Chase fell 8.5% during 
that time. The suit alleges that the bank was reckless when it issued 
a public statement on November 28th that did not fully disclose its 
exposure to Enron. JP Morgan Chase listed its total exposure to Enron 
at $900 million, then raised it to $2.6 billion, the attorneys said. 
JP Morgan Chase says that the action is without merit. It has been 
reported that the SEC is looking at JP Morgan Chase's disclosures 
about Enron exposure, and whether they were stated in a timely 
manner. JP Morgan Chases CEO has said that the bank assumed too many 
risks in dealings with Enron. It wrote off $456 million of trading 
losses and loans to Enron in the 4th quarter and has exposure to 
potential losses of $2.06 billion.

El Paso Energy Partners to Buy Texas Natural Gas Assets


    In a move to boost its balance sheet, El Paso Corp plans to sell 
10,677 miles of natural gas pipelines and gathering systems in Texas, 
and its share of a natural gas plant in New Mexico for $750 million 
to its partner El Paso Energy Partners. El Paso Energy will pay $560 
million in cash and transfer $190 million in assets to El Paso Corp, 
including a production platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The 
transaction is expected to close this quarter. El Paso Corp announced 
plans to sell $2.25 billion in assets after Moody's warned that it 
must reduce debt or face credit downgrades. Moody's has moved El Paso 
Energy Partners' credit outlook from positive to stable. El Paso 
Energy Partners' plan to pay for the deal by borrowing money and 
issuing shares will raise its debt by more than 50%, Moody's said. El 
Paso Energy Partners said the acquisition will raise its dividend 
this year by $0.10 per share to $2.60, the 4th increase in the past 
year. Including these purchases, El Paso Energy Partners has said it 
plans to spend about $1 billion this year on capital projects. El 
Paso Energy Partners plans to build and operate the 380-mile Cameron 
Highway Oil Pipeline System in the Gulf of Mexico and is looking for 
partners for up to a 50% share in the $450 million project. El Paso 
Corp owns 27% of El Paso Energy Partners, which was formed in 1998 to 
allow investors to buy shares in its natural gas storage, gathering 
and transportation businesses. El Paso has sold $416 million in 
pipelines and plants to El Paso Energy in the past year, not 
including their most recent deal. Late last year, El Paso said it 
would move $2 billion in debt held by affiliated partnerships onto 
its balance sheet and sell as much as $860 million in stock to 
reassure investors.

AES to Sell $1.5 Billion of Assets 
  
    AES, whose stock price plunged by 50% in just the last 2 
sessions, has said it would sell assets to raise between $1-$1.5 
billion, including some merchant and trading operations in New York, 
California and the UK. Shares of AES closed at $4.75, down $2.25, or 
over 32% yesterday. AES shares closed at $9.50 on Thursday. AES said 
that maintaining its cash flow cushion is the most significant 
priority at the moment. It also said it would reduce its exposure to 
Latin American markets. AES plans to sell Illinois utility Cilcorp; a 
minority stake in the Ipalco utility in Indiana; interests in Itabo, 
a coal-fired power plant in the Dominican Republic; and other 
unspecified AES plants. Fitch has downgraded AES debt and convertible 
securities because of tight liquidity, and put its debt on a negative 
outlook. S&P has put AES on credit watch with negative implications. 
There are questions about how much AES assets will fetch in a market 
already inundated with assets of other power producers attempting to 
shore up their balance sheets. Weak demand could also have an impact 
on sales. AES said it will cut capital spending by $490 million from 
a planned $1.2 billion, mostly from projects under construction. AES 
said it had $110 million cash on hand and another $155 million 
through a revolving loan credit, giving it a total liquidity of $265 
million. AES, whose Venezuelan unit Electricidad de Caracas was 
expected to generate about 10% of the companys total cash flow this 
year, was hurt by the devaluation of the bolivar, which fell by more 
than 10% after Venezuela began allowing the currency to float last 
week. AES has also said that because of the recent drop in its stock 
price, margin calls in connection with personal loans have led 3 
officers to sell shares.

Enron Problems Not from Mark-to-Market 


    Enron's accounting problems were not due to aggressive use of 
mark-to-market techniques but rather were the result of a lack of 
consistent, clear financial disclosure, according to a Dynegy senior 
executive at the Edison Electric Institute International Financial 
Conference in London. Increased financial disclosure is the critical 
issue for the industry, not mark-to-market itself. Accrual accounting 
for energy trading contracts, which has been replaced by mark-to-
market in most circumstances, provides more opportunities for fraud, 
manipulation and deception.

Marketers Say Derivative Bill Goes to Far 


    A bill that would provide greater regulatory oversight of 
derivatives, including those traded on electronic platforms, is an 
overreaction to Enron's collapse and could create more problems than 
it solves, according to the National Energy Marketers Association. 
The energy marketers say that the markets have already identified and 
punished companies that have problems similar to Enron. The bill is 
sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. It would remove 
existing exemptions and put the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
in charge of overseeing all energy derivative transactions conducted 
on multilateral markets and electronic trading platforms to ensure 
that such transactions are transparent. All bilateral transactions 
not regulated by the CFTC would fall under the FERC's jurisdiction. 
Also, the CFTC would ensure that entities running online trading 
forums maintain sufficient capital to carry out their operations and 
maintain open books and records for investigation and enforcement 
purposes.

Platt's Study Says Data Center Power Problems Never Happened


    Two years ago, utilities feared a surge of new data center 
development would overwhelm the electric power supply, but those 
fears were never realized. Now, utilities are preparing for the next 
wave of development of these facilities that house computers used to 
process and store digital information for the Internet, according to 
the latest in a series of E Source reports from Platt's. A series of 
studies titled, "Delivering Energy Services to Internet Hotels and 
Other High-Density Electronic Loads," explains why those anticipated 
electric loads never materialized. Many of the data centers that were 
planned for were never built. Those built and operating are running 
at low occupancy rates. Now, utilities are preparing for a future 
wave of data center development as the economy improves and demand 
for Internet-based services increase accordingly. The amount of power 
drawn by microprocessor chips continues to rise, and so the computers 
installed in future data centers may demand much more power than 
those installed today. However, a future power crunch is unlikely as 
utilities are already preparing for the next wave of expansion. 
Utilities are instituting infrastructure charges that shift risk from 
the utility industry to the data center developers. They are also 
encouraging their data center customers to use new, more efficient 
electronic technologies that only recently came onto the market.

TECHNICAL TRADERS OPTIMISTIC 

Market technicians are taking a close look at their charts to see if 
today's jump in prices will give way to bearish fundamentals.  "The 
earlier gap on the price charts should be a good reference point for 
price support," says John Beaver, President Private Futures Group, 
Oklahoma City.  Before today's trading a gap was left on the March 
daily bar chart by the trading that took place between January 18 and 
January 22, an extended holiday weekend. The low price for the March 
contract on January 18 was $2.21, but the high price on January 22, 
was $2.175 thus a 3.5 cent "gap" or area where no trading took place 
was left on the chart.  Today's trading also left a gap between the 
low, $2.27 and Friday's high of $2.21. The significance of the gaps 
is that typically buying demand is so great or selling pressure so 
heavy that the market will "gap" higher or lower with the next day's 
trading opening well above the previous day's high or substantially 
lower than the low of the day before.  "The gap on the (March) daily 
chart from 2.21 should be a good reference point for support. A gap 
was also left in today's trading. The area between $2.15 to $2.27 is 
good intermediate support. These gaps are significant in that they 
are holding," said Beaver.  Other traders aren't such strong 
believers.  "Gaps are almost always filled if for no other reason 
than markets go up and down. You wait long enough and they will be 
filled, the question is when," said a Houston trader.  "I look at 
them but they are overrated. Statistically they are extremely 
overrated, and traders put way too much emphasis on them but because 
people do that you have to pay attention to them," said a trader with 
Coquest, Dallas.  "Locals use more of an opening range than the 
gap, 'Let's say we've got a gap between $3.10 and $3.20. Are you 
buying 20's or 10's?  Where do you buy? Often the gap doesn't mean 
too much anyway'," he said.  "I look at them buy I wouldn't risk my 
reputation on them." Beaver is not deterred.  "I wouldn't mind seeing 
the AGA come out and push prices to $2.15 to $2.20 so i could buy 
some more. I think we could visit those support numbers very easily. 
If there were sell-offs, I would want to write some $2.00 put 
options. This last push down to $1.96 was a gift for writing out 
options," he declared.

FYI - I just reviewed the preliminary invoices for the global settlement contracts (8255, 20715, 20747, 20748, 20822, 20834, 20835, 21165, 21175, 25923, 25924, 26371, 26372, 26677, 26678) and the capacity release contracts (releasing and acquiring).  Everything looks good, including the necessary adjustments identified below.

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated last night for the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Texaco K #25923/25924 Comm - when verifying fuel rate of 4.5% between the lateral and mainline contract sched volumes, there is a ldifference that could not be attributed to rounding.  Need to verify if difference is caused by makeup volumes; and if delivery makeup scheduled, then invoice should be adjusted accordingly.

Please remember that the notes above are based on data as of 2/26/02.  I will review again on the 1st.  

Schedulers -  Please provide a final copy of the delivery tolerance report to both me and Marketing so it can be determined if makeup will affect the rate to be charged [some contracts are based on calculations, especially when charging incremental fees for alternate point usage].

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

California:

I99-07-003 SoCalGas Unbundling.  In addtion to the Southern California Generation Coalition (SCGC), the National Energy Marketers Association has also filed a Request for Rehearing of the unbundling decision.  Filing protests of the Implementation Plan this week were Indicated Producers, TURN, Dynegy, the City & County of San Francisco and SCGC.  

I00-11-002  Adequacy of SoCalGas System.  A number of parties filed comments on the impact of the unbundling decision on this proceeding.  All were in agreement that the CSA has created a system of unbundled, firm and tradable backbone transmission rights on the SoCalGas system and establishes the procedures for allocation of those rights therefore the capacity allocation proposals in the capacity OII are moot.  

Arizona:

Legislature - Gov. Jane Hull has advised lawmakers to either kill a scheduled 5% pay raise for the 50,000 state employees taking effect on April 1, 2002, or risk laying off 2600 employees.  With a 13 percent drop in withholding taxes, the states current revenue deficit is expected to be in the $200 to 250 million range.  Canceling the pay increases would save $24,000 in the current fiscal year and $100,000 next year.  Democrats are trying to save the raises, while the majority Republicans are supporting the proposal and threatening to shutdown the session by Feb. 15th if legislators don't face up to the budget problems and solve them.

New Mexico:

Legislature - Identical House Bill 423 and Senate Bill 369 were introduced this week to fund ($75,000) an update of the 1996 study regarding the economic feasibility of additional natural gas pipeline systems.  The 1996 study found a lack of capacity to move gas east especially from the Northwestern portion of the state.  If the bill is passed, a committee is to provide the results of the study and recommendations to the governor and legislature by December 15, 2002 for consideration in the next legislative session.

House Bill 230 provides for an expanded definition of "Indian Country" to include lands subject to "restriction by the United States against alienation" (i.e. lands held in fee by a tribe).  As proposed, the new definition would go beyond the current federal definition of "Indian Country".  The State Highway and Transportation Dept. Office of General Council has pointed out that if the proposed state law conflicts with federal law, then the federal law will take precedent.  This has been forwarded to Lou Saldano for review.

The following information and tips are provided to assist you as you're working with Outlook:

The Outlook mail file size restriction has been removed.  However, if you have ever submitted an eRequest for additional space, you will need to forward an email to the ETS Solution Center to have the email restriction lifted.

The steps listed below will allow you to turn off the Auto-Delete feature, so that your mail will not be deleted as you exit:
		Go to your inbox,
		Select tools,
		Select options,
		Select the "other" tab,
		Deselect the check box that says "empty deleted items folder upon exit".

You might want to consider creating a folder called 'Junk' or 'Undecided' for any non-business-related information or any retained items you don't want to clutter your normal folder structure.  

Regarding quarantined email messages:
Inbound - For inbound quarantined messages, a ticket needs to be opened with the Resolution Center, 713-853-1411.
If the intended email is of valid business-related content and you believe it requires Enron resources to retrieve it, the Help Desk will open a ticket to have the email released from quarantine and delivered to your e-mail Inbox. Your message will be scanned and checked for viruses prior to requested release.  If it contains a virus or there is reason to suspect it is malicious code, it will not be delivered.
Outbound - For outbound quarantined messages, an e-mail needs to be sent to IT Security and Controls (itsecurityandcontrols@enron.com) with the recipient's address and the subject line of message.

Williams Starts Up New Deepwater Pipelines in Gulf of Mexico

  

    Williams has begun receiving oil and natural gas into recently 

completed deepwater pipelines in the western Gulf of Mexico. First 

deliveries of oil were received January 28th and first deliveries of 

natural gas were received January 30th from the Nansen Field in the 

East Breaks area, located about 150 miles south of Houston in 3,700 

feet of water. The pipelines have a capacity of up to 80,000 bpd of 

oil and up to 360 MMcf per day of natural gas. Initially, deliveries 

into the line are expected to average about 20,000 bpd of oil and 

about 10 - 15 MMcf per day of natural gas. Production will continue 

to increase as new wells are tied in during the 1st and 2nd quarters. 

The pipelines will also serve a neighboring development in the 

Boomvang Field. Production from Boomvang is expected to start flowing 

into the pipelines in May. Williams' $200 million East Breaks project 

is made up of a 56-mile oil gathering system, a 114-mile gas 

gathering system, a new state-of-the-art 300 MMcf per day natural gas 

processing plant in Markham, TX, and a shallow-water platform at 

Galveston Block A244. The new Markham natural gas plant has been 

fully operational since the 4th quarter 2001.

Nuclear Power Plants Set Reliability and Output Records 

 

    Invigorated by another year of record operating performance, the 

US nuclear energy industry believes its prospects for future growth 

are as good or better than ever. Estimates for 2001 show that the 

nation's 103 nuclear power plants set an electricity production 

record for the 3rd straight year, increasing their output to about 

762 billion kWh.  The plants' average capacity factor--a measure of 

efficiency--reached a record high for the fourth straight year, 

climbing 1% to 91%. Other than their ability to reliably produce 

large amounts of competitively priced electricity, nuclear power 

plants have several other desirable, valuable attributes, such as 

providing a high degree of forward price stability, an attribute with 

significant value in a volatile commodity market. Nuclear plants also 

have clean-air compliance value. With support from the Bush 

Administration and nuclear-related provisions included in major 

energy bills introduced in Congress, nuclear energy is receiving 

strong bipartisan political support. Nuclear power plants supply 20% 

of the electricity in the US. 

 

EIA Says Natural Gas Prices to Drop Through this Summer 

 

 

    Natural gas prices will fall throughout the latter part of winter 

and continue to decline through the spring and early summer, 

according to the EIA. But the resulting decline in drilling would 

likely prompt a price recovery late this year or early next year. 

Assuming normal weather and barring any major supply disruptions, the 

average 2002 wellhead price should come be about $1.86 per MMBtu, the 

EIA reports in its latest short-term energy outlook. That estimate is 

down $0.19 from last month's  forecast and less than half of last 

year's average. The mild winter and subsequent high storage levels 

have combined to keep prices down. Spot prices have remained in the 

$2.30 - $3.00 range. But all that is likely to change later this 

year, the EIA predictes. Weak industrial demand and excess 

underground storage levels should keep a lid on spot prices until 

next fall. Next year as economic growth accelerates and as world oil 

prices rise, natural gas prices will also rise, averaging $2.39 per 

MMBtu in 2003. 

 

Although, EIA forecasts seem to always be a bit late in responding to
market changes and then seem to hang on to the current trend too long.

Also, today's Gas Daily has an article discussing EEA's recent natural
gas price forecast for the next two years.

As many of you know, yesterday we closed on Dynegy's option to acquire Northern Natural.  Shortly, a more comprehensive message will be distributed about that transaction and what it means for all of us.  

One important requirement under that transaction is that Enron Operations Services Company has agreed to continue providing certain services to Northern consistent with our past operations.  Northern will be billed for those services, and we will be required to demonstrate the basis for those billings.  

Effective, Feb. 1, all employees in the ETS family of companies that perform any services for Northern or related to Northern's operations in any way should keep timesheets documenting the amount of time spent on Northern projects or supporting personnel and activities related to Northern projects.  

If there are any questions about this requirement, please communicate with your department head or with me.  Thanks for your help in implementing this important requirement.  

Jim

I appreciate you moving so quickly on this. However, before we do anything, I need to see what you are proposing and visit with rod.
Thanks.

Kevin,

Donna and I are working on the floor plan.  We have you slotted to move with us (although we don't know exactly where yet), but we were not sure if we needed to make space for anyone else that works for you.  An assistant?  Davis Thames?

Please advise.

Thanks,
Kim.

OPEN SEASON

SG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR 
Holdings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage 
services at its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas

season will begin at 9:00 a.m. CDT on February 4, 2002, and will 
continue until 5:00 p.m. CDT on March 4, 2002. The project is located 
at the border of Mississippi and Alabama with access to the major 
pipelines serving the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeastern United 
States. The facility is ideally located to serve as a transportation 
and storage hub for shippers on any one of nine major pipelines that 
will be interconnected directly or indirectly to the project. 
Information on the facility and the Open Season is available on our 
web site at

Conoco and Tesco Unveil New Drilling Technology

  

    Conoco and Tesco will construct 3 innovative drilling rigs using 

Tesco's proprietary Casing Drilling technology. The drilling rigs 

will operate under an exclusive contract to Conoco for 2 years. Pilot 

testing shows the technology sharply reduces drilling costs and 

speeds well completion by using the conventional casing instead of 

drill pipe to drill the well. The companies say that Casing Drilling 

is safer and eliminates the time-consuming trips necessary to change 

drill bits and set casing. Tesco will operate the rigs for Conoco to 

conduct a 2-year development drilling program in Conoco's South Texas 

Lobo natural gas trend. The first rig is expected to be operational 

by September 1st. The other 2 rigs will be ready to begin work by 

year end 2002. Tesco says that wells drilled with Casing Drilling can 

be drilled up to 30% faster than conventional wells.

Demand Forecast to Rise Slower than Expected 

 

   Annual natural gas demand will eventually reach the 30 Tcf level, 

but it will take longer than initially predicted, thanks to the price 

spikes of last winter and the current economic downturn, according to 

Energy and Environmental Analysis. Instead of reaching 30 Tcf by 

2010, the nation will likely be consuming about 29.58 Tcf per year, 

and will reach 31.33 Tcf per year by 2015. Demand is forecast to 

increase in all sectors but most dramatically in power generation, 

which will likely see a 106% increase by 2015. Demand growth is 

driven by increased power generation demand, but a large amount of 

demand will continue to be for winter peaking needs. January 

consumption will increase from 86 Bcf per day in 2000 to 113 Bcf per 

day in 2015, or about 2 Bcf per year. The  production base is 

sufficient to satisfy growing demand, but regional production 

patterns will shift as production grows in the deep water Gulf of 

Mexico, Rockies and Arctic. Prices are forecast to average in the 

$2.80 - $2.90 per Mcf range until 2010. But from 2015 to 2020, prices 

are predicted to average between $3.00 - 3.50 per Mcf. 

 

Pakistan and Afghanistan Plan Natural Gas Pipeline 

 

     Pakistani President Musharraf and Afghan interim leader Hamid 

Karzai have agreed to cooperate in all spheres of activity, including 

a proposed natural gas pipeline project from Central Asia to Pakistan 

via Afghanistan. Pakistan and several multinational companies, 

including Unocal and Bridas of Argentina, have been considering the 

idea of constructing a 1,000-mile pipeline from Turkmenistan through 

Afghanistan to growing natural gas markets in Pakistan and, 

potentially, India. Musharraf told Karzai that Pakistan and 

Afghanistan are bound together by common geography, faith, history 

and culture. Karzai says he looks forward to a tremendously good 

future ahead with Pakistan. 

 

Alaska Introduces Legislation to Authorize Bonds to Finance Pipeline

 

    Alaska's governor has introduced state legislation to authorize 

the Alaska Railroad Corp to issue $17 billion in tax-exempt bonds to 

finance the proposed Alaska Highway natural gas pipeline. The bill 

would amend existing law to authorize the railroad company to issue 

the bonds to finance construction and maintenance of a natural gas 

pipeline and related facilities for transporting volumes from 

Alaska's North Slope. It also authorizes the company to negotiate 

with producers on the bond issue. The railroad company was granted 

tax-exempt status when it was transferred from federal to state 

ownership in 1983, a status reaffirmed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 

It can be used for conduit financing of the proposed pipeline to the 

lower market states, but neither the company nor the state would own 

the pipeline or be liable for the debt. Debt responsibility would 

fall on privately owned companies that build, own and operate the 

pipeline. The governor says the project could help Alaska deliver up 

to 6 Bcf per day to the nation. The project would bring good jobs and 

revenue to the state. ExxonMobil and Phillips Petroleum have been 

studying the feasibility of building a pipeline through Canada. The 

pipeline's cost has been estimated at $15 billion - $20 billion.

The TW team is running blind as far as pricing information is concerned.  NNG leaves today for Dynegy and we have been relying on Preston and Vernon for our princing information.

We need your help!  Kim has asked me to email you guys and ask if there are any updates on TW getting pricing information.

Please!  I'm begging.

Crude Oil Futures Slide Downward


    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX slid $0.62 to 
$20.88 per barrel yesterday, on concerns that Russia's pledge to trim 
150,000 bpd from exports will end in March. Prices took a hit after 
Russia said the export cuts executed last month by OPEC and other big 
oil producers had stabilized oil prices, leading many to believe that 
it will move to end its output curbs by the end of the 1st quarter. 
Early in March, OPEC will send a high-level delegation to Moscow to 
push for a continuation of the curbs until the end of June. The curbs 
have produced a surplus of crude and oil products in Russia's 
domestic markets, lowering prices by an average of $4.00-$5.00 per 
barrel. Some Russian firms have planned to export more refined 
product to replace lost crude sales. In addition, Russia's big oil 
companies have said that they plan to raise oil production by as much 
as 27% this year. According to IEA data, OPEC did not live up to its 
pledge to trim production as members cut output by less than 50% of 
the 1.5 million bpd it pledged. Non-OPEC Oman agreed to trim 40,000 
bpd, but made no changes in output. Angola, committed to cut 22,500 
bpd then boosted output by 70,000 bpd. Heating oil futures for March 
delivery on the NYMEX trimmed $0.0149 to $0.544 per gallon. March 
gasoline futures on the NYMEX lost $0.0184 to $0.5925 per gallon. In 
London, Brent crude oil futures for April delivery on the IPE were up 
$0.19 to $20.52 per barrel.

Consultants Say MTBE Phase Out Too Costly
  
    The California Energy Commission has been told by its consultants 
that the cost to phase out MTBE may be prohibitively expensive.  The 
consultants from Stillwater Associates told say that keeping the 
current phase out date for MTBE of January 1, 2003, will cause a 5% 
to 10% gasoline supply shortfall, and retail price increases of 50% - 
100%.  The consultants recommended delaying the MTBE phase out to 
November 2005. The CEC consultants pointed out many ominous 
similarities between the electric power and gasoline markets.  A few 
corporate players dominate both markets, and access to supply from 
outside the state is restricted by logistics.

Unocal Gasoline Patent Rejected 


    An alleged Unocal patent for cleaner gasoline was rejected in a 
preliminary review by the US Patent and Trademark Office after 
protests from refiners that face millions of dollars in license fees. 
The review last month by the patent office determined that Unocal did 
not invent anything new or novel in its number 393 patented gasoline 
blend, according to Valero Energy. Unocal accused Valero last month 
of infringing on its fuel patents. Unocal says it still expects its 
patent will be supported and borne out by the very documents that the 
other parties are using to support their argument. Unocal's 5 patents 
on cleaner-burning gasoline may generate about $75 million to $150 
million per year in royalties. Eight companies have signed license 
agreements, which require them to pay from $0.012 ? $0.034 per gallon 
to Unocal. Shares of Unocal fell $0.46 to $34.91.

TotalFinaElf Pursues Middle East Natural Gas Deals
  

    TotalFinaElf is pursuing natural gas deals with Iran and Saudi 
Arabia. It has already produced oil from Iran's Sirri field, and is 
currently starting production from the South Pars natural gas 
project. TotalFinaElf says that full commercial production of natural 
gas from the $2 billion South Pars project is expected before the end 
of the 1st quarter. The company said it would insist on a minimum 
return of 15% on capital in real terms for any new investments in 
Iran. Saudi Arabia is expected to sign agreements on its $25 billion 
natural gas reserves soon. The deals, which mark the end of 25 years 
of state control of Saudi Arabia's natural gas fields, were divided 
between upstream and downstream activities. Iran is opening the doors 
to foreign investment after 20 years of isolation. The Iran Libya 
Sanctions Act does not permit US companies to invest in Iran but 
European are anxious to cash in on the country's vast reserves. 
Recent declarations by President Bush that Iran was part of an axis 
of evil is not likely to change the way TotalFinaElf looks at 
possible investments in Iran, the company's CEO said. He contends 
that there is a certain level of political risk in the oil and 
natural gas industry because the Middle East controls 2/3 of the 
world's oil reserves and 1/3 of its natural gas. TotalFinaElf is 
expected to meet its target of 10% growth in production in 2002, 
despite cuts by OPEC. It expects to boost its current 2.2 million bpd 
of oil equivalent to 2.8 million bpd by 2006.

PetroChina Interested in Husky Energy 


   PetroChina is considering the purchase of Husky Energy's 
exploration and production assets. Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing owns 
72% of Husky. Trading of Husky's stock was halted on the TSE after 
word got out that PetroChina was interested in acquiring its assets, 
which are valued at $4.4 billion. Husky's stock jumped last fall 
after it was thought that TotalFinaElf might be making a bid for the 
company. PetroChina is conducting an internal feasibility study for 
the purchase but has not entered into formal negotiations with Husky. 
PetroChina is also in talks on a $2 billion, 1,490-mile oil pipeline 
running from Siberia to China. Husky has an interest in the Terra 
Nova oil field off Newfoundland and could possibly proceed on another 
project in the area, White Rose. Along with these assets, Husky has 
oil and natural gas fields, heavy crude production projects in 
western Canada and it operates a chain of service stations and the 
60,000 bpd Husky Upgrader, which transforms heavy oil into light 
crude. It also has a 40% share in the Wenchang development in the 
South China Sea in partnership CNOOC. PetroChina has proven reserves 
of 11 billion barrels of oil and 32.5 Tcf of natural gas. Husky owns 
proven reserves of about 600 million barrels of oil and about 2 Tcf 
of natural gas. Phillips and another Canadian company have also been 
mentioned as potential bidders for Husky.

Weekly Retail Gasoline Prices Jump Higher

  The retail price for gasoline increased $0.009 last week to $1.116 
per gallon, according to the DOE. The price of regular unleaded 
gasoline is down $0.33 from a year ago due to a drop in overall 
petroleum demand from the slowing economy, plenty of gasoline 
supplies and lower crude oil costs. The national average price for 
RFG was up $0.017 to $1.169 per gallon. Prices on the West Coast 
increased $0.016 to $1.244 per gallon. The lower Atlantic states had 
the cheapest fuel an average price up $0.001 to $1.049 per gallon. 
The average price for diesel fuel nationwide increased $0.003 to 
$1.156 per gallon, but down $0.32 from a year ago. New England had 
the highest diesel fuel at $1.29 per gallon, up $0.005. The Gulf 
Coast states had the cheapest diesel at $1.126 per gallon, up $0.004.

Saudi Arabia Expects Russia to Extend Cuts through June


    A battle could be brewing after Saudi Arabia said it expects 
Russian oil companies to extend export curbs through the end of the 
2nd quarter. OPEC and other producing countries, including Oman, 
Mexico and Norway, committed to maintain their cuts through June, but 
Russia has been vague on the duration of its output reductions. 
Russia's prime minister will meet today with oil companies to discuss 
ending its 150,000 bpd cut. Russian officials have said that it wants 
a stable oil market and that the current cuts have achieved the 
country's aims. Russia, which wants to reclaim its position as the 
world's top oil producer, produced 7.6% more crude last year than in 
2000 and increased exports by 11%. Some Russian oil companies have 
said that they plan to increase production by up to 27% this year. 
The IEA has said that Russia was not alone in not living up to its 
pledge to cut production as OPEC members cut output by less than half 
of the 1.5 million bpd it pledged. Non-OPEC Oman agreed to cut 40,000 
bpd, but made no changes in output. Angola, committed to cut 22,500 
bpd then boosted output by 70,000 bpd.

We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

Stan

It is with sincere sadness that I inform you of a tragedy that occurred.  Doug Hammer, an Enron Northern Natural Gas senior operations and maintenance technician located at the LNG facility in Wrenshall, Minnesota, died earlier this week.

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

On January 29, 2002, Enron named Stephen F. Cooper interim CEO and chief restructuring officer. To keep employees informed about developments, Mr. Cooper left voicemail messages to employees on January 29 and February 8.   Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcripts of those messages.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Friday, February 8, 2002

Hi everybody.  This is Steve Cooper.  It's about 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock Houston time, Friday afternoon.  It's been a pretty hectic week, but I'd like to take just a moment to bring everybody up to date so that everybody is fully in the loop with what's gone on this last week.

Beginning last weekend, the Board's special investigative committee released a fairly lengthy report - in fact it's about 200 odd pages, and it's fairly pointed and blunt.  The report was troubling, and as I'm sure any number of you has seen from the various investigatory committees this week, its findings have further dented our corporate history.  Nonetheless, I just wanted to let you know that my role and the job I'm paid to do, and hopefully, the job all of you are getting paid to do, is to look forward and proceed that way at 100 percent full speed.  I continue to believe we really have a lot to look forward to.

The committee and the report didn't offer any specific recommendations.  Rather, it just compiled what they believed to be a series of facts about transactions that have been undertaken over the last several years.  Enron's board, management and Creditors' Committee are now working together to evaluate the reports' findings and take whatever action is required.  I, like many of you, am looking forward to management changes that result from these actions because to successfully to restructure the company, we're going to have to have a management team in place that is credible, that's committed to moving forward for the future, that is trusted by our outside constituents, and are firmly committed to make a new Enron work.  Next week, after the Board meeting, I hope to be able to share with you the management changes that are being contemplated and outline a team that Jeffrey and myself are compiling to rebuild the company.

The Washington hearings this week heated up considerably and made for some either very dull or very expected or pretty interesting television viewing.  And obviously, this has been translated into the daily headlines.  Hopefully, these investigatory processes will continue to help uncover and address any past misconduct or negligence surrounding Enron.  And with this, I'm sure we'll be able to establish appropriate safeguards for employees and shareholders going forward - not only for Enron - but for other corporations.  This situation, I believe, will have a national impact.

It's going to force the big five accounting firms to change the way they do business - in fact it already has.
It's going to bring in new and more effective reporting rules.
It's going to put more teeth into the SEC,.
ARISA is going to be modified.
There's not a doubt in my mind that Congress or these Committees are eventually going to look at Wall Street and the commercial banks and put them in their sites.

During the last week I've spent almost all my time dealing with the company's Creditors' Committee and chatting with individual members of the committee to understand their current thinking, concerns and issues so we can begin to construct with them an absolutely open agenda, a free flow of information, a free flow of communications, and begin to work with them to develop a plan to reorganize Enron.  As I continue to look at our various businesses, I'm as optimistic as I was a week ago that there is a reorganizable platform here that ought to allow us, if everybody is reasonable and responsible, and we can begin to put some of our emotions aside to create a viable strong company that ought to be able to be successfully reorganized.

In any event, I'll continue to keep you updated as we move forward.  In the meantime, if you have any specific questions or comments about Enron or its restructuring or anything else that's on your mind, don't hesitate to either send me an e-mail or give me a buzz and I will do the best I can to respond as quickly as possible.  If my response isn't satisfactory the first time around - just buzz me again.

Listen everyone, have a wonderful weekend and I hope to see you next week in Houston.  Bye-bye.

STEPHEN F. COOPER VOICEMAIL
Tuesday, January 29, 2002

Good morning everyone, this is Steve Cooper ? it's the morning of January 29th and I wanted to take an opportunity to introduce myself and tell you how pleased I am to have been selected as Enron's interim CEO.  My firm, Zolfo Cooper, my partners and I have assisted hundreds of companies as they have worked their way through the restructuring and reorganization process.  I just wanted to give you some of my thoughts about it as we move forward.

I can't imagine what the past few months have been like for all of you.  I'm sure it's been incredibly difficult, particularly with the glare of the media attention and the numerous investigations and inquiries that have been launched and continue to be launched.  In that environment, I've got to believe it's difficult, if not impossible, for you to focus on what lies ahead for Enron and for the organization.

I'm not going to bother to restate what is in the press release announcing my selection and our new management team this morning, however, I'd like to tell you how we typically approach situations like this.

It's been the experience of myself, my firm, my partners, that in helping companies emerge from bankruptcy, we look at a number of key metrics to gauge the potential for successful restructurings.  Those metrics are typically the organization, the asset base that the company has to bring to bear, customer base, and liquidity.  From what I've been able to tell over the last couple of days and with my exposure to the management team here, Enron has a very, very bright, very capable, very committed, hardworking and dedicated organization.  All of the people I have met are committed to reorganize, restructure and bring Enron to a successful new beginning and emerge from bankruptcy.

Number 2, the physical assets look to me to be of an enormous advantage here.  The regulated assets, the pipelines, the generating plants provide steady and reliable cash flow and provide a very sound fundamental base to restructure around.

Third, loyal customers.  Most of Enron's customers have continued to stand by the company and continue to take delivery of natural gas and electricity on a daily basis.

And fourth, liquidity looks good with the cash the company has on hand, the cash it expects to generate in the near term, and with the backstop of the DIP financing, it doesn't appear that we will have any liquidity issues going forward.

With those four resources nicely in place, I'm very confident that we can successfully restructure this company.  I don't want to leave the impression that it will be easy.  It's going to be an enormous amount of work.  There will be upsets, issues, and concerns along the way.  But I can tell you that I've seen companies in bankruptcy that don't have nearly as strong a position as this company.  They were able to emerge successfully from bankruptcy, and I'm certain Enron will also.

I'm looking forward to working with all of you over the next few months and I'm very pleased to be here.  Jeff, Ray and I will keep you informed on a regular basis as we move forward.  If there are any thoughts, concerns, issues that you would like to bring to my attention, please don't hesitate to drop me a note or give me a call.

Thanks so much, and I look forward to working with all of you.

Yes, but I still make sure Richard has included everything.  He sometime leaves the sales out.

TK,

These reports seem to be looking good.  Are you comfortable with them since they are now being done out of Houston?

Dear You watson, 

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel: 

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft. 

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight. 

SECURITY FEE
The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket. This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002. It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.

Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority. Be sure to stay informed with continental.com at:
http://continentalairlines.rsc01.net/servlet/cc4?JHEVCU*rPHmlhgQLgkhgEJht*z*UA
before leaving for the airport. We're looking forward to welcoming you onboard! 

Sincerely,
Mark F. Bergsrud
Vice President, Marketing
Continental Airlines, Inc.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================

PREVIEW for March 3, 2002

======================================================

Dear Folks -

   I hope you have been allowing the story of One/Two Man to work its magic
on you. It is a most wonderful story.

   But what in the world - either the outer or inner world - does such a
story have to do with us? And those various animals who helped One/Two Man
in his task? Especially the snake?

   When we gather this week, as promised, I'll give you some ideas about
what this story means. What I'm mostly interested in is how we can use this
story and others like it - and there are many - for our own movement toward
freedom and love.

   I also want to connect this story to that primal Judeo-Christian story of
the exodus.

   I hope to see you this week as we continue our journey
   from bondage to freedom,
      from darkness to light,
         from death to life.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

========================================

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an
enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment.

The gathering meets on Sunday mornings at 9:45 am in Fondren Hall at St.
Paul's UMC - 5501 South Main, Houston, Texas and is taught by Dr. Bill
Kerley. If you would like more information -

Hunt Oil Commissions Study for Camisea LNG Project

 

    A subsidiary of Hunt Oil, Camisea LNG, has selected Kellogg Brown 

& Root, a division of the Halliburton, to conduct a Front End 

Engineering Design study for a LNG liquefaction facility and marine 

terminal on the coast of Peru south of Lima. The $8.5 million study 

is expected to be complete in about 8 months. The facility will be 

near the Camisea natural gas field, which is estimated to contain 13 

Tcf.  Development of the field and construction of a pipeline and 

related facilities to deliver gas to Lima are currently underway and 

are expected to be completed in 2004. If the plant is constructed, 

Peru would become the first country in South America to export LNG, 

with shipments expected by the last quarter of 2006. The FEED 

contract will include studies from the inlet to the LNG facility, 

through the liquefaction process, to the marine LNG loading facility. 

The design study contemplates a one-train liquefaction plant with a 

total production capacity of at least 545 MMcf of gas per day. 

Kellogg Brown & Root will also study and engineer plans for a 

dehydration facility, an acid gas removal facility, and other 

necessary infrastructure. Concurrent with the FEED contract, 

environmental impact assessment for the Camisea LNG export project 

will be conducted.

Most New Single Family Homes Prefer Natural Gas Heat 

 

    About 70% of the single family homes completed in 2000 featured 

natural gas heat, demonstrating consumers' strong preference for the 

efficient, clean-burning fuel, according to the AGA's 2000 

Residential Natural Gas Market Survey. Electric heat was 2nd at 27%, 

followed by heating oil at 3%. Natural gas has been consumers' 

favorite energy for home heating for more than 12 years, because 

customers prefer its comfort, reliability and value.  Along with 

natural gas heating systems,  builders are also including natural gas 

fireplaces, barbecue grills, garage heaters and other amenities in 

new homes to meet consumer demand.  The natural gas share of new 

single-family home completions matched or exceeded the electric share 

in all regions. More than one of every 10 new natural gas residential 

customers in 2000 converted to natural gas from electricity, heating 

oil and other energy sources, the AGA survey reported. In the multi-
family sector, 

natural gas was in 45% of the units completed in 2000, 

up from 43% in 1999. When both single and multi-family units are 

considered, natural gas house-heating market share of new housing 

increased from 64% in 1999 to 65% in 2000. The electric home-heating 

market share dropped from 33% to 32% in 2000. Overall, 59 million 

residential customers, or 61% of total US households, had natural gas 

service in 2000. About 83% of those natural gas customers use natural 

gas for house-heating purposes, representing 51% of total US homes. 

The total number of natural gas residential customers rose by almost 

1 million from 1999 to 2000. 

 

Baker Hughes Weekly Rig Count

 

     The number of rigs searching for oil and natural gas in the US 

fell by 15 to 838 last week, according to Baker Hughes.  There were 

1137 a year ago. The number exploring in Canada was down 13 to 439, 

compared to 565 a year ago. The number of rigs in the Gulf of Mexico 

was up 2 to 116, compared to 161 a year ago. The number searching on 

land was 694, and the number of offshore rigs was 123. There were 21 

inland rigs. The total North American rig count dropped 28 to 1,277, 

compared to 1,702 a year ago. The total searching for oil rose by one 

to 144, and the number searching for natural gas fell by 16 to 693. 

There was one miscellaneous rig, unchanged from last week.

Subject: TW Red Rock Schedule

This week we conducted another detailed Red Rock schedule and risk review.  Due to several continuing and cumulative negative factors, we are re-forecasting the project schedule.  The forecasted dates are now:

*	Station 1	15 June 2002 (was 1 June)
*	Station 2	15 June 2002 (was 1 June)
*	Station 3	1 July 2002 (was 22 June)

Factors which previously impacted the schedule include late air permits and the inability to start construction due to the contractors' unwillingness to work on credit.  Please recall that we were originally scheduled to start construction in mid-October, but were delayed about six weeks due to the air permits.  Permits were received and construction scheduled to start in early December, when the bankruptcy / advanced payment issues caused the contractors to delay the start.

Factors which continue to impact the project are

*	Lack of materials causing lack of construction progress.  Several vendors and contractors continue to delay until they receive payment; due to a lack of cash, some payment needs identified in December are just now being paid.  The table below indicates the lag in payments.
*	Nuovo Pignone unit testing delay (only affects unit 3).
*	Winter weather - not out of the ordinary, but we are impacted by trying to do civil work during winter weather.  Our original plan was to be complete with civil work before winter.

The dates above are based on resolution of the material delivery items immediately.  Further delay in vendor payments / material deliveries could impact the dates further.

We have considered many alternatives to minimize construction schedule, and are doing those that are feasible at this time.  They include

*	maximum piping pre-fabrication
*	early tie-in at Station 2
*	geotech experts on site to immediately approve variations in construction specifications
*	installation of tents to enable civil construction

We will continue to evaluate schedule-enhancing activities and may be able to take additional steps at the appropriate phases of construction (e.g., working 2 shifts when the work can be done safely at night, and having Nuovo Pignone representatives on site early).

Jerry

I spoke with Paul Haas with Kinder Morgan (NGPL) today about this.  He said it is not NGPL's intention to ever shut this point in if TW is overdelivering, only to cut the point back to rate.  He pledged their continued cooperation and as a followup, Darrell Schoolcraft and I have a conference call with Paul and Darrell's countepart scheduled for Tuesday, 2/19 to discuss the operation of TW/NGPL points and possible payback of volumes on the OBA.

Randy - if you have anything in particular that you would like us to bring up during the call, please call Darrell.  Thanks.

Lorraine,

Would you please have a conversation with KMI about Randy's concern of KMI shutting in the Gray I/C w/o notifying us and the problems it would cause at P-3.  Also, keep Darrell, Market Services and, of course, Randy, plugged into the status.

Thanks, Kim.

I've just been included in some discussion about this interconnect.  Apparently Kinder-Morgan wants to put a control valve downstream of our measurement point.  They want to do this to have some control of deliveries off TW onto their system.  They have some concern about over-deliveries.  I understand that this happened on a couple of occassions in the past (possibly due to a malfunction with our valve).  They assure us that this control valve is only to provide them with the protection against over delivery.
It would be set to flow at a rate equal to their nomination, I guess.  
As I said, they intend to set this valve downstream of measurement, on their pipe.  Since it will be installed on their pipe, I don't think there's much we can do about it.
However, we were wondering if there can be some wording or agreement formalized that says they would not shut this point in before contacting our field personnel and/or gas control.  I don't think this is their intention, but if they did shut in without notification, it would cause problems at our P-3 station.
We've tried to talk them out of this installation, but they seem adamant to proceed.
I wasn't sure who to contact about this.  Could you let me know if this is a major concern with marketing and scheduling?
Thanks

Lisa, Steve Harris suggested I share with you our concerns on the subject of "Shared Drives".  We had some problems on last week with deleted files on the TW_NNG Shared Drive -"S".  The Help Desk has resolved these problems, but in the process, we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  

Our concerns are such that some files should be viewed only by ETS, specifically TW.   Would you please check on this concern as soon as possible?

If you would, please update me on the status of this request.  If you have additional questions concerning this problem, please do not hesitate to call me (x35849).  

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention.

Dennis -

Yeah, I heard about your misadventure yesterday from Kim.  Those airbags are
pretty exciting, aren't they?

You can mope, or you can take the approach I took:  "Goody!  I can buy that
convertible that I'm now middle-aged enough to deserve!" and get yourself
another little sportster.  I hear that Ken Lay has a couple of Benz' that
have been repo-ed and may be looking for a buyer.

Glad you've lost nothing but a little skin and a ton of metal and plastic.
The rest can be replaced.

Been there, done that...

Subject: 2002 Better ???



I know 2002 was supposed to be better than 2001, but we are off to an
imperfect start up here in the hills.

I totaled my Red Racer yesterday [subject to insurance adjuster's
certification, of course].  Man, we were supposed to grow old[er] together
and all that stuff and it was just getting broken in good @ 124,000 miles
and it just gobbled up and zipped up, down and around all these hills like
it owned them [which it did].  No "zipping" was going on yesterday, I will
testify.

And now Janell thinks we should get a "tankier" replacement to protect
against these old geezers who have now proven they can get in my way.  No
serious damage to either driver [I know the other guy].  Just my first
experience with air bag explosion and associated abrasions and broken heart
from losing my old red buddy.  I made the stupid mistake of telling mom I
was only in a coma for "a couple of hours", and now I will have to work to
get that image out of her head, but, hey, I am not myself, I had a big
wreck.  I shall, of course, exploit that sentiment to the max.

When I went out in the garage today to run Janell to work and my car wasn't
there, it was not a good moment, but I am being very, very brave.

I went out last night and bought a new computer rig to cheer me up and next
tuesday I will get cable modem internet connection, so we will be cookin' up
here in the woods.  I have always had state of the art PCs, but have never
had to buy one before.  My bosses used to do that, but they seemed to have
stopped now for reasons I must investigate.  I also upgraded my hotmailbox
to 10mb, so you can send me tons of funny graphics without it choking now.
I wanted to get DSL, but SWBell doesn't offer it here yet, and the cable
boys beat them to the punch by finally completing their fibre optic intalls,
so I had to go that way to get speedier.  Oh well, we're ahead of Afhanistan
up here in technology, but probably won't be after we finish spending
billions of our $$$ over there.

Be careful drivin'
Dennis

On February 27th, the FERC approved TW's Electronic Contracting filing to become effective March 4, 2002.  We made the filing to correspond with the implementation of the new contracting system in Market Services.  Shippers can still contract via fax and in writing; however, they will now (I believe after this coming weekend) by able to do requests and contracting electronically.  This include capacity release.  There were a few minor changes in the shipper requests requirements, but I believe most of these were already occurring; we just updated the tariff language.  

One change which is very different is that a service agreement must be signed and returned within 15 days instead of 30 days. 

If you have any questions, please call myself (x54600) or Teb (x36868).

Jane -

You'll have a more traditional "thank you" note coming shortly, but I wanted
to drop you a line to say how much Kim and I enjoyed the cuisine, the
company, the conversation and the cordials (if we'd have smoked cigars, it
would have been 5-for-5).  Richard and Judy were delightful, and you and
Barry the consummate hosts.  Your home is even lovelier than before.

Thanks for including us and we look forward to our next outing with the
Hills!

Take care,
John

To follow up on our phone conversation this morning...you had found an additional 4,514 MMbtu/day of West Texas receipts available during the months of 11/02, 12/02, 01/03, and 02/03.  Let's allocate this to the remaining 2 shippers still looking for West Texas supply.  Please allocate on the administrative contract as follows:  2,000 will go to PP&L (they will now have everything they need from West Texas) and 2,514 allocated to Calpine (they will also now have everything they need).  Paperwork is forthcoming.  I believe these will be the last amendments prior to flow.  Thanks.

Crude Oil Futures Rise as Economy Brightens


    Crude oil futures for April delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.45 to

helped out by increased sales of SUVs, warmer than usual winter 
temperatures and lower retail prices. Recently, total fuel demand has 
been about 2% below last year, after remaining about 4% below for 
most of the winter due to unseasonably warm temperatures, which 
lowered heating oil demand, and a sharp drop in airline flights after 
September 11th. An agreement between OPEC and other producing nations 
to trim output by almost 2 million bpd appear to be finally taking 
hold. Refiners have also cut runs because of poor profit margins, 
which could add to the total oil in inventories but lowers products 
supply. According to EIA data, oil inventories dropped by 1 million 
barrels, or 0.6%, last week, marking the 2nd consecutive week 
supplies have fallen. Heating oil futures for March delivery rose 
$0.0089 to $0.5628 per gallon in pre-expiry trading. April heating 
oil futures gained $0.017 to $0.5715 per gallon. Gasoline futures for 
March delivery on the NYMEX, which also expired yesterday, lost 
$0.003 to $0.581 per gallon. April gasoline futures climbed $0.0135 
$0.6778 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures on the IPE was 
up $0.48 to $21.33 per barrel.

OPEC Production to Stay Unchanged

    OPEC is will not to adjust production in its March meeting, 
according to its secretary general. OPEC expects oil prices to remain 
at current levels through the first half of this year. The cartel cut 
its production by 1.5 million bpd in January in an effort to bolster 
prices. OPEC may consider adjusting production at its September 
meeting or call an emergency meeting before then if necessary. Prices 
have rallied recently amid rumors of a possible attack on Iraq and 
expectations of a decline in inventories.

    Kinder Morgan shares fell over 11% yesterday, down $5.20 to 
$41.00 per share, and shares of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners dropped

Canadian Producers Receive C$85 Million to Drop Oil Sands Dispute 


    A group of seven Canadian producers will receive C$85 million 
from the Alberta government to end a dispute that threatened to block 
further development of Alberta's massive northern oil sands. The 
agreement with the government and Conoco will settle a complex 
dispute that has dragged on for years. Conoco became involved after 
buying Gulf Canada last year. The companies claimed they were 
deprived of their rights after provincial regulators told them in 
1999 to shutdown about 150 natural gas wells located at Surmont, near 
Fort McMurray. The wells produced natural gas from reservoirs 
overlying the oil sands deposits. The regulators ruled gas production 
would deplete underground pressures, jeopardizing plans by Gulf 
Canada to develop a C$1.3 billion oil sands project. Alberta has 
decided not to pay compensation to the producers which claim C$200 
million annually in lost revenues. Alberta's oil sands, with total 
reserves of 300 billion barrels, are expected to attract at least 
C$25 billion in spending as energy companies proceed with numerous 
projects.

Marathon Holds First Investor Meeting

    At its first investor meeting since its split from US Steel, 
Marathon Oil revealed plans for 2 natural gas projects, a North Sea 
natural gas pipeline and a LNG facility in Mexico. The LNG facility 
would have the capacity to convert 750 MMcf per day of LNG back into 
natural gas to be sold in Mexico and California. Marathon could face 
some stiff competition as there are more than a dozen plans to build 
LNG facilities in or near the US. The project which includes a LNG 
terminal, pipelines and a power plant could start up in 2005. The 
other project is a North Sea pipeline, with a 900 MMcf per day 
capacity, that would run 675 kilometers to a terminal in England. 
Marathon and US Steel traded under a tracking stock structure over 
the last 10 years or so, which restricted the performance of 
Marathons stock. In the past few years, Marathon has been revamping 
its exploration and production business, which was having trouble 
replacing it oil and natural gas reserves. Marathon has cut nearly 
25% of the jobs in its exploration and production unit since 1999 and 
sold most of its Canadian oil assets. It is now focusing on projects 
in Russia, North America, North Africa, Indonesia and the North Sea. 
Marathon was also awarded a stake in one of Saudi Arabia's highly 
valued natural gas projects and has a strong refining and marketing 
partnership with Ashland. In January, Marathon reported a 4th quarter 
loss of $898 million and has about $900 million of debt from the 
breakup with US Steel.

Oil Shares Climb on Rating Upgrade


    Shares of oil companies traded mostly higher yesterday after 
Deutsche Banc Alex Brown upgraded its rating on integrated oil 
companies, citing better prospects for prices ahead. The integrated 
oil group was upgraded to `overweight' from `neutral'. Despite the 
near-term risks to prices and equities, the fundamentals are 
improving, eroding the fear of a price war. As a result, the oil 
price forecast has been increased by $1 to $20.50 per barrel for 
2002. It also upgraded ExxonMobil to `buy' from `market perform' and 
raised its price target on its stock to $46 from $41 to reflect an 
improved outlook for earnings, returns, upstream volume growth and 
the potential for significant multiple expansion during 2002.

BP to End Political Donations 

  
    BP, which operates in over 90 countries, says that as a global 
policy from now on it will make no political contributions from 
corporate funds anywhere in the world. The move comes as US lawmakers 
consider restrictions on corporate donations to politicians and 
political parties. The downfall of Enron has added pressure to revamp 
political campaign finance laws. Enron donated about $6 million to 
politicians since 1989 and had close ties to a range of lawmakers and 
government officials. BP says that it will engage in policy debate, 
stating its views and encouraging the development of ideas, but it 
will not fund any political activity or any political party. BP 
conducts about 40% of its business in the US and is one of the 
largest foreign firms operating in the nation. Most of BP's $840,000 
in US political donations made last year were tied to Amoco and Arco, 
which are now merged with BP. At a federal level, BP's $250,000 of 
donations were split about 60-40 in favor of Republicans, while the 
$590,000 donated at state level was split about 60-40 in favor 
Democrats. In the US, BP has received criticism from environmental 
groups opposed to drilling in protected areas in Alaska. Outside the 
US it has been targeted by human rights groups for its relationships 
with Chinese firms.

I have talked with Jennifer McQuade at UBS and she had stated that UBS will not allow TW to continue the Data Feed that we had before on EnronOnline.  She also said that TW will not be allowed view only status.  At this time TW must fill out an application and must be creditworthy before access to their online system will be allowed.  

I have let Bobby and Martha know this and asked them to approach UBS from the technical side.

 Crude Oil Futures Drift Downward

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX slipped $0.14 
to $19.64 per barrel yesterday after traders had time to digest the 
latest weekly inventory statistics. API and EIA figures raised 
concerns about tepid demand and overshadowed reports that OPEC is 
moving closer to compliance with its output reductions effective on 
January 1st. The latest data from the API says that crude inventories 
grew by 978,000 barrels while the EIA reported a much larger 2.4 
million barrel increase. Although distillate and gasoline inventories 
decreased from the previous week, they remain substantially larger 
than year ago levels as do crude supplies. News that more European 
gasoline cargoes are bound for the US kept the lid on buying, traders 
said. According to the EIA demand for refined petroleum products in 
the US was 3.5% lower than a year ago. Also pressuring prices was 
word from Kuwait that its 280,000 bpd refinery which caught fire last 
week is now back on line and no further interruptions in production 
are expected. Signs of increased OPEC compliance came from reports 
that exports for last month were 22.74 million bpd, down 1.06 million 
bpd from 23.8 million the previous month. Heating oil futures for 
March delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.0085 to $0.5194 per gallon. March 
gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0013 to $0.5697 per gallon. In 
London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were 
down $0.10 to $19.21 per barrel.

Conoco Replaces 432% of Production in 2001
  
Conoco added more than 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 
including syncrude, to its proved global reserves in 2001, replacing 
432% of the oil and natural gas the company produced during the year. 
Conocos 2001 proved reserves were 3.58 billion BOE, including 
syncrude, up 35% from 2000. International proved reserves, which 
accounts for about 83% of Conoco's global reserves, were up 45% to 
2.98 billion BOE. Conoco's 2001 reserve additions mainly came from 
its purchase of Gulf Canada. Significant reserves also came from the 
UK, US, Vietnam and Indonesia. Conoco replaced 113% of production, 
excluding the Gulf Canada reserves and other acquisitions throughout 
the year. Conoco says that between 1997 and 2001, it replaced an 
average of 246% of production, among the best in the industry. 
Conoco's 2001 production of 281 million BOE reflects a 17% increase 
over 2000. Natural gas production was up 19% to 741 Bcf. Natural gas 
production rose from 35% of total production in 1997 to 44% in 2001. 
Conoco says that 7 out of 19 exploratory wells drilled during 2001 
resulted in discoveries, with a potential of about 100 million BOE 
from the Sutu Vang field in Vietnam. Conoco sanctioned 2 fields last 
year, the Gulf of Mexicos Magnolia field and the Sutu Den field 
offshore Vietnam. In the North Sea, Conoco made 5 discoveries close 
to existing processing and transportation facilities and is also 
drilling  at sites in the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, Western 
Canada, San Juan Basin and Indonesia that are close to processing 
facilities and pipelines. Conoco has more than 40 wells planned for 
exploration and appraisal in 2002 at an estimated cost of $500 
million.

Shells Earnings Tumble 47% in 4th Quarter


    Royal Dutch/Shell Group says 4th quarter profits tumbled by 47% 
from $3.58 billion a year ago to $1.91 billion, excluding special 
charges. Analysts had expected earnings in the $2 ? $2.4 billion 
range. Shell is still sticking by its annual growth target of 3%, 
which was lowered from 5% last year. Shell's target growth rate for 
oil and natural gas production is comparable to Exxon Mobil's, but 
much lower than TotalFinaElf's 6% projection. Over the past 3 years, 
Shell has cut costs by $5.1 billion. In the last quarter, oil 
production dropped by 1%, while natural gas climbed 6%, yielding an 
overall output rise of 2%. Exploration and production earnings fell 
by 52% in the 4th quarter from $2.58 billion a year ago to $1.24 
billion, excluding special items. However, Shell is still cash rich 
with $7 billion on hand, and has a debt to equity ratio of 10%, below 
target of 20% - 30%. Shell is looking to use the money to increase 
its natural gas holdings. It plans to complete acquisition of 
refineries from ChevronTexaco in the coming weeks and expects to 
eliminate 10% - 15% of jobs to cut costs. Chemical earnings nose-
dived 69% to $33 million, excluding one-time charges and fuel sales 
profits fell 38% to $585 million. Earnings from the natural gas and 
power unit climbed by 10% in the last quarter to $172 million from 
$157 million. Shell may spend up to $5 billion to repurchase shares 
for cancellation this year, after spending $4 billion last year.

    Royal Dutch/Shell Group plans to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars to put its name on thousands of Texaco stations it is 
receiving getting from ChevronTexaco as part of a $3.86 billion 
purchase. About 13,000 Texaco stations in US will be renamed, The 
company will also give its Shell stations a new look. Shell and Saudi 
Refining also bought ChevronTexaco stakes in two refining ventures. 
ChevronTexaco got the assets when Chevron purchased Texaco last 
October for $45.8 billion. The renaming is part of a larger plan to 
reinvigorate the Shell brand in the US and improve financial 
performance.

Valero on Lookout for New Acquisitions


    After announcing that it would sell its 168,000 bpd Golden Eagle 
Refinery near San Francisco and 70 retail stations in Northern 
California to Tesoro for $1.08 billion, Valero now finds itself on 
the lookout for other properties to acquire with its proceeds. One 
asset that Valero may be considering is El Paso's 140,000 bpd Eagle 
Point, NJ refinery. El Paso has said that it will sell $2.5 billion 
in assets to shore up its balance sheet, with over half of the deals 
to be completed in the 1st quarter of this year. But Valero may hit a 
roadblock in gaining regulatory approval to buy the refinery. 
Pursuant to Valero's recent acquisition of  Ultramar Diamond 
Shamrock, the FTC required it to divest the Golden Eagle refinery. 
The FTC may balk at allowing Valero to purchase another refinery, 
even in a different part of the country, since it already has 12 
refineries in the US and Canada. Valero estimates its total refinery 
system throughput at 2 million bpd and it also has a 5,000-store 
retail network. Alternatively, Valero could spend its proceeds to 
repurchase $400 million in stock this year and to pay down debt, but 
has reiterated its interests in adding to its refining capacity. 
Valero's criteria for possible purchases is a capacity of more than 
100,000 bpd, easy access to waterborne transport and the potential 
for upgrades.

Petrobras 2001 Output Rises 

    Brazil's state oil company, Petrobras,  says daily average oil 
output in 2001 rose to 1.38 million barrels from 1.32 million in 2000 
despite the loss of its biggest rig. Natural gas production rose to 
41.03 million cubic meters per day from 38.36 million in 2000. The 
2001 record crude output exceeded Petrobras' latest production target 
for the year of 1.34 million bpd even after the sinking of the huge 
rig in March and a 5-day oil workers strike in October. The P-36, a 
180,000 bpd rig sank after a series of explosions that killed 11 crew 
members. Petrobras last year also delayed introducing another rig by 
several months due to problems in obtaining an environmental license. 
In January, it set a new domestic monthly production record of an 
average of 1.47 million bpd, 1.4% higher than in December.

Thank you

Subject:	Enron Federal Credit Union Announces New Name!

We're beaming with excitement to share our new name with you!  It's a name that reflects the
true culture and beliefs of your Credit Union, and represents the reliable and innovative services
you expect and enjoy as a member.
  
 << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >> 

Due to the unfortunate circumstances that surround Enron Corp., we believe it is important to change our name
for the sake of our membership and our organization.  Careful consideration went into choosing a name that we
feel describes our Credit Union's trustworthiness, shining service, and extensive product line that offers value
and convenience to each of our members. 

All of your Credit Union accounts remain unaffected, including your membership, loans and other account
services, as does our friendly staff.  Over the next few weeks, watch your mail and our web site (currently www.enronfcu.com) for information about our new web portal and e-mail addresses, as well as communications regarding your options to receive new ATM cards, VISA check cards, credit cards and checks.  

Give us a call with any questions at 713.853.6242, or drop us a note at efcu@enron.com.  Also, watch your mail for
information about our new location coming soon!  We look forward to sharing a bright future with each of you under our new name!

Ordinary Life Gourmands -

We're ready to meet at Tom & Jerilynn's house for our bimonthly gathering of
the Gourmet Group, Saturday, March 23.  I believe the plan is to meet at 6
p.m., so mark your calendars accordingly.  If that is not correct, I'll let
you know.  Directions will be provided before the event.

Kim has doffed her toque long enough to do research on various recipes a la
Francais, and we submit the following assignments pour du nuit:

Jennifer & Jerry -

Bring French bread, plus

Title: Roasted Garlic

Servings: 2
Total Time: 45 min.
Baking Time: 40 min.
Preparation Time: 5 min.
Comments:
This a really simple appetizer to make. If you haven't had roasted garlic
before, you'll be amazed how roasting makes the pungent garlic into a
buttery, mellow spread. I like it best spread on fresh bread with goat
cheese on top. Its also a great butter and mayonnaise substitute for
sandwiches, that's low in calories. (Ignore the 83% fat percentage in the
nutritional information below, its counting all of the olive oil, most of
which slips off) The whole head of garlic has only 24 calories!!

Ingredients:
1 head garlic
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
Instructions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Chop top 1/5 of garlic head (from the pointy
tip).  Discard any extra garlic skin, leaving most of it intact.  Place
garlic head in a medium sized piece of aluminum foil.  Pour olive oil on top
of garlic.  Wrap foil around garlic, encompassing the entire head.  Bake in
oven until the garlic is golden brown and the garlic pulp is easily removed
from its individual shell (around 40 minutes).  Remove from oven; let cool.

Natural Gas Futures End Friday Flat


    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX  ended 
another boring session flat for the day last Friday at $2.138 per 
MMBtu. The April contract gained $0.008 to $2.198 per MMBtu. The 
market opened lower, but was soon boosted by short-term cold and 
short-covering from speculators and locals pushing as high as $2.165 
per MMBtu. Buy-stops were believed to be above $2.17 per MMBtu, and 
will still likely be there today. Estimated volume Friday was only 
about 50,400 contracts, with 19,600 of those spreads. There just was 
not enough volume to hit the buy-stops as the market hovered mostly 
between $2.14 ? $2.15. With the market unable to breach $2.17, 
speculators were forced to back-off late. If $2.17 can be breached 
today, the market could rise to the next resistance level at $2.22, 
and then possibly as high as $2.48 before reality once again sinks 
in. However, if the cash market opens lower this morning, the market 
may not get a chance to test the resistance. With still more than 1 
Tcf in excess storage over last year and a relatively mild winter so 
far, the market's short to medium term bias is still down. Natural 
gas for weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat 
to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry 
hub gained $0.05 to $2.19 per MMBu.

Enron Power Trading Falls in 4th Quarter

  
    Enron's 4th quarter power trading volumes were about 26% lower 
than the previous quarter, which is surprising since it was bankrupt 
for a third of the quarter and in deep trouble for over half of the 
period. Enron Power Marketing sold almost 221 million MW from October 
through December, down from about 300 million MW sold during the 3rd 
quarter. Last week, the FERC began investigating allegations that 
Enron unfairly raised wholesale power prices during California's 
power crisis last year. After Enron took a $1.2 billion write-down in 
shareholder equity related to its off-balance-sheet transactions, 
other energy firms limited their trading with Enron out of concern 
credit obligations. In the first 3 quarters of 2001, Enron had about 
15% of the nations wholesale power market and AEP was next in line 
with about an 8% share. The table below shows Enron's biggest 
customers, the total MW sold and the highest price paid by each for 
the 4th quarter.

Mirant Moving to Allay Investor Fears


    In an attempt to allay the fears of investors, Mirant plans to 
sell assets and reduce expenditures to lower its debt. Shares of 
Mirant have fallen by 50% in the last 2 months, following the 
downfall of Enron and the downgrade of about $4.9 billion of its debt 
to junk status by Moody's. Last week, Mirant said that 4th quarter 
earnings had dropped by 55%, due to lower energy prices and a charge 
of $66 million from exposure to Enron. It also cut its capital budget 
by 50% and lowered its earnings forecast in 2002 to $1.60 to $1.70 
per share, from its December estimate of  $1.90 to $2.00, because of 
lower profit margins. Mirant expects 1st quarter profits of $0.30 per 
share, lower than last year's $0.52 per share. Profit for the 4th 
quarter dipped to $30 million, or $0.09 per share, from $67 million, 
or $0.20 per share a year ago. Revenue was off 9%, to $7.24 billion 
from $7.96 billion. Mirant was spun off from Southern Company in 
September 2000 and the deal was completed last April, when Southern 
distributed 272 million shares, or 80% of Mirant for $9.44 billion. 
In efforts to distance itself from Enron, Mirant points out that 
assets, such as power plants, contributed 90% to its profitability, 
unlike Enron, whose trading unit was responsible for 90% of its 2000 
revenue. Mirant has delayed plans to spend $3 billion on tripling its 
15,000 MW of power this year. Instead it will limit capital spending 
to the completion of power plants that will produce 5,700 MW. Mirant 
will also cut about 65% of job at its German unit, Bewag, which it 
wants to sell.

Midwest ISO Begins Selling Regional Transmission Service  

    The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator has 
implemented its tariff and will now provide regional transmission 
service for bulk power in the Midwest ISO footprint. Transmission 
customers are now able to request transmission service from Midwest 
ISO without going to individual transmission owners. The Midwest ISO, 
which serves 21 transmission owners in 15 states, is responsible for 
evaluating and coordinating requests for access to the regional power 
grid on a non-discriminatory basis. The Midwest ISO says that 
transmission customers in the Midwest will now benefit from 
standardized rates, terms and conditions for service over its 86,000 
miles of transmission lines. Transmission customers are now able to 
request transmission service from the MISO's OASIS website, giving 
them the ability to view transmission availability data at the same 
time and request transmission service in the same manner. It also 
provides for streamlined electronic scheduling which allows customers 
to easily schedule approved transactions for service across multiple 
control areas in the MISO footprint. In addition, customers will now 
have access to an independent, regional analysis of bulk power flows 
utilizing a standard methodology. The MISO will provide a single bill 
to customers for all transmission service provided.

Wisconsin Energy Power Plant Plan 

    Wisconsin Energy plans to build $3 billion in new electricity 
generators over the next nine years to meet growing energy demands. 
Forecasts indicate Wisconsin will need more than the 2,800 MW the new 
units will generate by 2011. The projects include 2 natural gas fired 
generators and 3 coal burning units at existing power plants. Other 
power producers including Calpine and Mirant have delayed new 
construction in the state because of lower electricity demand and 
prices. The first natural gas fired should be under construction by 
early next year to be in service before the summer of 2005. Wisconsin 
Energy has created a subsidiary that would build and own the 
generators and lease them back to the utility for up to 25 years. 
Calpine, Enron and PG&E had opposed the proposal, saying it would 
delay deregulation in the state by more than a decade.

Thanks for the kind words, Jerilynn.

Regarding "toque blanche," I knew that a toque was the traditional brimless
chef's hat, but was unsure of the spelling.  Looking at my on-line
dictionary (www.m-w.com), I got the right spelling and found out that the
adjective "blanche" (white) was commonly appended.  So I added it, too.

I'll pass along your appreciation to Kim.

John

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of January 27, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   This on-line newsletter offering previews and summaries of the
Ordinary Life gathering now goes to almost 800 people all over the
United States and in at least three foreign countries that I know of. I
am both delighted and stunned that my rantings are useful to so many.

   Of course, I hope what I have to teach has universal applicability
even though it is spoken to a group of 100 to 120 folks in Houston each
week. Sometimes things are more meaningful to the local gathering. That
may be the case for what happened this past Sunday. Then, again, maybe
not. Read on ?

   Richard Wingfield put together a moving and informative video about
work that the Ordinary Life gathering has had a stake in for some years
now. We have sent both people and money to our "sister" church in
Cochabamba, Bolivia. I want to quote at length from a letter sent to
the Ordinary Life gathering by Wilson Boots. He was on the video shown
Sunday.

   "I trust that you have had opportunity to see the video record
filmed by Richard Wingfield of the dedication of the health clinic at
Emmanuel Methodist in Cochabamba, Bolivia. It was a wonderful day,
filled with hope for the host of church and community people who
gathered to celebrate this special moment. With much gratitude we
expressed heartfelt thanks for the vision and commitment of the
Ordinary Life Class that through your special offing made possible the
construction of this community health center. It's location adjacent to
the back wall of our small church sanctuary symbolizes in a special way
the profound Gospel dimensions of the healing and health that are
shared here daily in the lives of very poor people of the community.

   "It will be of interest to you to know that the small room where
Rev. Diane Wimberley is living during her year of service with Emmanuel
is just thirty feet away from this modest clinic. Diane is involved
daily in ministry with the dedicated community M.D. and nurse who
provide such excellent care for so many children, women and men who
have no other possibilities for medical care due to their situation of
poverty and absence of other health care alternatives.

   "This is a time of serious crisis, however, for this medical
outreach ministry. Due to the general economic crisis in Bolivia, and
the ending of financial support for the Doctor and nurse due to the
unusual circumstances of the international organization that has been
giving support, the work of this medical outpost has been seriously
curtailed. In fact, if minimal monthly funding cannot be made available
for at least a few months until some alternative grant can be secured,
it is the real possibility that the clinic will be closed.

   "I want to ask your consideration for the possibility of some
immediate support of this urgent need."

   Diane Wimberley sent a letter to Richard Wingfield in which she also
explains the situation. I cites parts of it:

   "One of the things that I am writing about is a need for money. The
center is in bad shape. The doc is having to cut his hours back in
order to take another job - a situation caused both by the situation
here and his practice not pulling in what it should due to the economic
crisis in the country.

   "He is a rare one who is deeply committed to this center and
everything that it stands for. He recruits other doc's in the city to
volunteer, works on soliciting other clients. He basically has told me
that his life was changed by the center when he began and nothing can
make him leave it now. So he will work three jobs: for the government
which he hates, for the university, in his private practice and come
here 2 hours in the middle of the day. He is completely committed to
helping children and their families. "

   Diane states that up until this crisis he was being paid $250 a
month by the center. That is the amount she is asking for from Ordinary
Life.

   I have gotten both calls and e-mails from folks after last Sunday
indicating that people are more than willing to see us do this - or
perhaps even more. We didn't have time to discuss this Sunday but I
wanted you to have this information and we'll talk about it when we
gather this week.

   Thanks again to Richard Wingfield for doing such an outstanding job
bringing us the story.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

Eric and Kim:
I was hoping to send some information to a potential equity investor (ArcLight) regarding both the TransPecos and Sun Devil transactions.  I have a  very brief presentation or detailed model - nothing in between.  I'm looking for commercial overview, strategic rationale and summary economics.  Do you have anything like this already prepared? If not, is there anyone who could quickly pull this together? 
Kevin

What's Next for
Enron Federal Credit Union

Over the years, Enron Federal Credit Union has been proud to share the Enron name and support many wonderful employees and their family members around the world.  Here are some of the exciting changes slated for the Credit Union in the coming months.

New Name
We believe it is important to change our name for the sake of our members and our organization. Our new name will reflect everything that we stand for: trustworthiness, outstanding service, innovative products, value and convenience. You can expect to hear about our official new name later this month.
    
Expanded Field of Membership
Also, being a single sponsor Credit Union for Enron Corp., it has become necessary to expand our field of membership. We continue to welcome and serve current Enron employees and their families, but we will now also invite individuals and businesses that live, work or worship in Downtown Houston and the surrounding areas to become members of our Credit Union.

Additional Location
Another immediate area of focus for the Credit Union is our location. We have made plans to open an additional full-service facility that will be located in close proximity to the Enron Building in the downtown area with easy access. More information about our new location will be announced as soon as it becomes available. At this time, our current office facility will remain open and accessible for all of our members.  

We are excited about the changes that 2002 will bring and look forward to sharing the experience with each of our members.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 6, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   I know that lists like the following pop up now and again on the
internet. This one, sent to me by George Leyendecker, has some fresh
ones ?

   1. The best way to get even is to forget.
   2. Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.
   3. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts.
   4. Some folks wear their halos much too tight.
   5. Some marriages are made in heaven, but they ALL have to be
maintained on earth.
   6. Unless you can create the WHOLE universe in 5 days, then perhaps
giving "advice" to God, isn't such a good idea!
   7. Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks up.
   8. Standing in the middle of the road is dangerous. You will get
knocked down by the traffic from both ways.
   9. Words are windows to the heart.
  10. A skeptic is a person who when he sees the handwriting on the
wall, claims it's a forgery.
  11. It isn't difficult to make a mountain out of a molehill just add
a little dirt.
  12. A successful marriage isn't finding the right person, it's being
the right person.
  13. The mighty oak tree was once a little nut that held its ground.
  14. Too many people offer God prayers, with claw marks all over them.
  15. The tongue must be heavy indeed, because so few people can hold
it.
  16. To forgive is to set the prisoner free, and then discover the
prisoner was you.
  17. You have to wonder about humans, they think God is dead and Elvis
is alive!
  18. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just
be sure to flush when you are done.
  19. You'll notice that a turtle only makes progress when it sticks
out its neck.
  20. If the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, you can
bet the water bill is higher.
  21. You are richer today if you have laughed, given, and forgiven.

   These are pithy sentences that can cause us to laugh and to think.

   There is another phrase I use in our work from time to time. It is -

   Having a heart as light as a feather.

   What does that mean?
    Is it possible?
     If it is, what keeps us from experiencing it more?

   These are some of the questions I want to talk with you about when
we gather this Sunday. I invite you ?
   to be present,
    to bring your heart,
     to be prepared to lay aside some of your burdens, and
      to dare to open some doors to new life.

   My heart is hoping to see you Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX  ended another boring session flat for the day last Friday at $2.138 per MMBtu. The April contract gained $0.008 to $2.198 per MMBtu. The market opened lower, but was soon boosted by short-term cold and short-covering from speculators and locals pushing as high as $2.165 per MMBtu. Buy-stops were believed to be above $2.17 per MMBtu, and will still likely be there today. Estimated volume Friday was only about 50,400 contracts, with 19,600 of those spreads. There just was not enough volume to hit the buy-stops as the market hovered mostly between $2.14  $2.15. With the market unable to breach $2.17, speculators were forced to back-off late. If $2.17 can be breached today, the market could rise to the next resistance level at $2.22, and then possibly as high as $2.48 before reality once again sinks in. However, if the cash market opens lower this morning, the market may not get a chance to test the resistance. With still !
more than 1 Tcf in excess storage over last year and a relatively mild winter so far, the markets short to medium term bias is still down. Natural gas for weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.05 to $2.19 per MMBu.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
  <BR>
    Enrons 4th quarter power trading volumes were about 26% lower than the previous quarter, which is surprising since it was bankrupt for a third of the quarter and in deep trouble for over half of the period. Enron Power Marketing sold almost 221 million MW from October through December, down from about 300 million MW sold during the 3rd quarter. Last week, the FERC began investigating allegations that Enron unfairly raised wholesale power prices during California's power crisis last year. After Enron took a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity related to its off-balance-sheet transactions, other energy firms limited their trading with Enron out of concern credit obligations. In the first 3 quarters of 2001, Enron had about 15% of the nations wholesale power market and AEP was next in line with about an 8% share. The table below shows Enron's biggest customers, the total MW sold and the highest price paid by each for the 4th quarter. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    In an attempt to allay the fears of investors, Mirant plans to sell assets and reduce expenditures to lower its debt. Shares of Mirant have fallen by 50% in the last 2 months, following the downfall of Enron and the downgrade of about $4.9 billion of its debt to junk status by Moodys. Last week, Mirant said that 4th quarter earnings had dropped by 55%, due to lower energy prices and a charge of $66 million from exposure to Enron. It also cut its capital budget by 50% and lowered its earnings forecast in 2002 to $1.60 to $1.70 per share, from its December estimate of  $1.90 to $2.00, because of lower profit margins. Mirant expects 1st quarter profits of $0.30 per share, lower than last years $0.52 per share. Profit for the 4th quarter dipped to $30 million, or $0.09 per share, from $67 million, or $0.20 per share a year ago. Revenue was off 9%, to $7.24 billion from $7.96 billion. Mirant was spun off from Southern Company in September 2000 and the deal was completed last !
April, when Southern distributed 272 million shares, or 80% of Mirant for $9.44 billion. In efforts to distance itself from Enron, Mirant points out that assets, such as power plants, contributed 90% to its profitability, unlike Enron, whose trading unit was responsible for 90% of its 2000 revenue. Mirant has delayed plans to spend $3 billion on tripling its 15,000 MW of power this year. Instead it will limit capital spending to the completion of power plants that will produce 5,700 MW. Mirant will also cut about 65% of job at its German unit, Bewag, which it wants to sell.<BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator has implemented its tariff and will now provide regional transmission service for bulk power in the Midwest ISO footprint. Transmission customers are now able to request transmission service from Midwest ISO without going to individual transmission owners. The Midwest ISO, which serves 21 transmission owners in 15 states, is responsible for evaluating and coordinating requests for access to the regional power grid on a non-discriminatory basis. The Midwest ISO says that transmission customers in the Midwest will now benefit from standardized rates, terms and conditions for service over its 86,000 miles of transmission lines. Transmission customers are now able to request transmission service from the MISO's OASIS website, giving them the ability to view transmission availability data at the same time and request transmission service in the same manner. It also provides for streamlined electronic scheduling which allows!
 customers to easily schedule approved transactions for service across multiple control areas in the MISO footprint. In addition, customers will now have access to an independent, regional analysis of bulk power flows utilizing a standard methodology. The MISO will provide a single bill to customers for all transmission service provided. <BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>    Wisconsin Energy plans to build $3 billion in new electricity generators over the next nine years to meet growing energy demands. Forecasts indicate Wisconsin will need more than the 2,800 MW the new units will generate by 2011. The projects include 2 natural gas fired generators and 3 coal burning units at existing power plants. Other power producers including Calpine and Mirant have delayed new construction in the state because of lower electricity demand and prices. The first natural gas fired should be under construction by early next year to be in service before the summer of 2005. Wisconsin Energy has created a subsidiary that would build and own the generators and lease them back to the utility for up to 25 years. Calpine, Enron and PG&E had opposed the proposal, saying it would delay deregulation in the state by more than a decade. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#001020" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE!

Jennifer -

I haven't heard from Sam, so I don't know her status.  She got the same
e-mail everyone else did, so if I hear from her, Kim will give her an
assignment.

I'm forwarding your message to Kim so she can answer your question about the
pear dish.  We have not made it before, so I can't answer your question.

John

John,
Do we know if Sam is coming?  I am wondering on my assignment for the pears.
Also, have you and Kim made this before?  Would it be OK to make the pears
and sauce ahead of time or shall I bring it for preparation?
Thanks.

Thanks Tiny. Kim and Darrell let us know how you want to do this and we'll =
move forward. If we can get some kind of agreement put together with Citize=
ns on what they need maybe we can do these changes one time. As you know we=
 have had a lot of issues with them since start up.=20
Thanks

Subject:=09Griffith Interconnect Pressure

I'm going to try and clear this up:

Robert Francen (928-226-2219) with Citizens called about the Griffith inter=
connect a couple of weeks ago.  He made a request that we configure our flo=
w control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pre=
ssure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although=
 I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to che=
ck with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was th=
at by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to s=
witch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pre=
ssure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they=
 cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutt=
ing TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without =
direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I ca=
lled and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in ag=
reement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going t=
o communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm=
 not sure how to handle his request at this point. =20

Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently =
out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pr=
essure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state =
pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dra=
matically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that =
if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ou=
rselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then=
 getting into competing issues with El Paso. =20

I do not care how we configure this point.  However, again it could have im=
plications for marketing and gas control so, I prefer that you all make tha=
t call.

The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates. 

How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?

Thanks: John Buchanan

OPEN SEASON

 

SG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR 

Holdings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage 

services at its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas 

storage facility, known as the Southern Pines Energy Center. The open 

season will begin at 9:00 a.m. CDT on February 4, 2002, and will 

continue until 5:00 p.m. CDT on March 4, 2002. The project is located 

at the border of Mississippi and Alabama with access to the major 

pipelines serving the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeastern United 

States. The facility is ideally located to serve as a transportation 

and storage hub for shippers on any one of nine major pipelines that 

will be interconnected directly or indirectly to the project. 

Information on the facility and the Open Season is available on our 

web site at 

http://www.sgr-holdings.com <http://www.sgr-holdings.com/>  

or contact us at 713-914-8188.

 

>From http://www.enerfax.com <http://www.enerfax.com/> :

 

Baker Hughes Weekly Rig Count

 

   The number of rigs searching for oil and natural gas in the US 

fell by 6 to 853 last week, according to Baker Hughes. The total was 

down from 1,138 a year ago. The number searching in Canada was down 7 

to 452, compared to 579 a ago. The number of rigs in the Gulf of 

Mexico was down 3 to 114, compared to 159 a year ago. In the US, the 

number searching on land was 714, and the number offshore was 121. 

Eighteen were operating in inland waters. The total North American 

rig count fell by 13 to 1,305, down from 1,717 a year ago.

Audrey,

Someone from Infrastructure should be contacting you this morning.  We will need to know the specifics of which files should not be accessed by only TW (or ETS).

Thanks,
Scott.

Subject:	Shared Drive Concerns


Lisa, Steve Harris suggested I share with you our concerns on the subject of "Shared Drives".  We had some problems on last week with deleted files on the TW_NNG Shared Drive -"S".  The Help Desk has resolved these problems, but in the process, we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  

Our concerns are such that some files should be viewed only by ETS, specifically TW.   Would you please check on this concern as soon as possible?

If you would, please update me on the status of this request.  If you have additional questions concerning this problem, please do not hesitate to call me (x35849).  

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention.

Hey, Kim-
I tried to call you today (I was out sick yesterday - respiratory crud) but your voice mail didn't ever pick up.  I'm ok, just working myself out of a job pretty quickly.  Hope you are well.

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

Regards,
Mansoor Abdmoulaie & Perry Frazier

Okay!  I have to be the bad guy and say I can't meet Monday.  I have a meeting with Kevin Hyatt from 9 - 10 am.  Can't skip that one.  Mansoor agreed we can meet on Tuesday at the same time in his office.  Is this still okay with you Michelle?

Lorraine,

I take it that contracts 25923 and 25924 should remain under Texaco's control?

Sold 5,000 MMbtu/d of firm transport to Western Gas Resources from Permian to Topock at .095 plus fuel, generating over $101,000 for the 7 summer months of April through October.
Agreement reached between ENA and TW for capacity for February.  Transwestern, as agent for ENA, released a package of 25,000 MMbtu/day from Ignacio to Blanco to Burlington.  The new contracted max rate of .1020 is .0420 higher than the original rate and will be split 50/50 with ENA.  This will net TW an incremental $14,700, in addition to regaining the original $42,000.
New OBA, containing cash out provision, with Mojave is executed.

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)

Dennis -

Thanx for the laughs!  Not many around here, these days...but things are
looking up with the trip tomorrow on tap.

"New Look"?  Last time you introduced a new look, Gillette equities went
through the roof.  Do I need to buy some stock in Nair or Neet, now?  You'll
be quite the hit at the Aquatorium, or the Natatasium, or the cement pond.
Will probably cut minutes off your lap time...and, no, I don't mean to
suggest that you're drinking directly from the pool.

We're up at 3 a.m. tomorrow to make it to IAH by 5.  Four-hour flight to
Newark, then a mere 17-hour jaunt over the Pole to HK, fortunately in the
front of the bus.

When he heard about the trip, one of my docs advised me to take an aspirin
before the flight.  I thought he was concerned about the prophylactic
treatment of a hangover from the free wine in first, but he said I should
thin my blood so we don't throw a clot from sitting in one place for too
long.  Oh.

Frankly, sometimes you can have too much information.

Glad to hear you're a part of the mbps crowd...broadband is best!  (unless
you are Enron Broadband)  Now you'll be able to download twice as much trash
in half the time...HOORAY!

If your Austin trip allows it, maybe we could meet you on neutral ground
(think Switzerland, or Chappell Hill) and have lunch.  Or you could take the
easterly leg and sail through Houston and drop in on your friends here.  You
could even meet the new cat and/or spend the night.  Tempting, isn't it?

Great news about Janell!  Maybe she'll be up to a trip in '03 (we're talking
about something special in August 2003 to coincide with our 20th
anniversary...think Edinburgh, London, Paris, two weeks).

Man, your connection is so fast, my fingers are getting all tied up trying
to stay ahead of your reading.

Gotta go.  See you on the other side of the International Date Line.

Ah yes, my favorite topic [fast losing favor to the tales of Enron's

PS - I am now zipping all of this info around on my new >1 mbaud link that I
finally shamed the cable company into getting hooked up [only took two
separate visits and plenty of customer "motivation"]  In tandem with my new
1.5ghz CPU, 80gb disk and CD burner, I believe I have moved us into the 20th
century [Alas, I know that everyone now agrees that you are in the 21st in
Houston].

Got the settlement on my old red buddy, but am still grieving and in a
quandry about what to do [no enthusiasm by either partner up here for
spending $$$ after the first year of Prince George's economic slide and the
Enron debacle].

Janell is now improving rapidly and we actually have a small jaunt planned
to Austin that looks very unlikely to be cancelled.  I have a new "look"
that I have been dying to spring on "the group" since before the Italia trip
was scrubbed.  It may be an old look [or gone] before we meet again.

I hope you get to see King Kong in hong Kong...isn't that where he lives??

Subject:	RE: San Juan Pigging/DRA

I am attaching a profile of the efficiencies between Bloomfield and Bisti for Feb 22-
March 11.

 
Summary
1)	Before pigging, (i.e. 21-27th), the efficiency was about 96.5%
2)	After the pig run on the 27th, the efficiency increased to about 102% for two days.
3)	It averaged about 101% for the next 6 days (i.e. 28th-5th March).  
4)	It then steadily plummeted to 98% over a 3-day period - a percent degradation a day! (5th-8th March)
5)	It remains around the 98% average today.

Essentially, the high efficiency resulting from the 27th Feb pigging lasted just about a week.
The targeted efficiency for this section is 103%.

At the TW commercial meeting this afternoon, we indicated that applying the DRA around the end of May (together with other planned outages) may be the way to go. Meanwhile,  I believe we should schedule another pig run as soon as we can. 
I did also receive the sample collected from the last pig run. I will have it analyzed and report on our findings.

Please let me know any thoughts you may have on this issue

We kicked a pig down the San Juan Lat. on 2-27-02 @ 08:03 MST Pressure was 1145 PSI, Flow of 840.  It was a newly rebuild pig and was kicked dry.   Bisti was down for 55 min, and the pig went by Bisti @ 10:26 MST.  Data at each valve site retreved off RTUs.   If you have any questions or comments, please call.

We know how interested all of you are in the Retention & Severance Plan, so we want to update you on its status.
 
As many of you know, we have been working with members of the Creditors' Committee and their consultants since December to formulate a Retention & Severance Plan, and we formally presented the plan to the committee on Friday, February 22.  We had hoped the committee would approve the plan quickly so that we could file it with the bankruptcy court and share the details of the plan with you before the end of the month.
 
We know that many of you have career options outside of Enron and that the Retention & Severance Plan may impact your decision to stay or to leave.  We sincerely regret to inform you that approval of the plan for debtor companies is delayed.  We're learning that, in bankruptcy, most things don't move as quickly as we are accustomed.
 
The committee outlined some concerns related to our proposed plan, but we are confident we will be able to reach agreement with the creditors on those concerns.  The Creditors' Committee fully supports the implementation of a Retention & Severance Plan.  Such plans align the company's objectives with the goals of the creditors and are fairly standard in bankruptcy.  These plans are designed as a way to preserve and maximize value for the estate.
 
The Creditors' Committee also understands that time is of the essence for getting a plan in place and has established a subcommittee to expedite their review and approval process.  To that end, we are meeting regularly with the subcommittee.  We intend to work hand-in-hand with them to reach agreement on an acceptable plan as quickly as possible.  This is currently our top priority, bar none!
 
When we filed for bankruptcy, we did not fully grasp how tedious the process of developing an acceptable plan would be.  Unfortunately, that lack of understanding led management to set unrealistic expectations about how quickly a plan might be in place.
 
We now know that it takes significant time, resources and effort to understand, identify and gather the massive volume of required details, to formulate that information into a reasonable program, and to prepare a rationale and compelling presentation.  The process mirrors the most time-intensive business presentation or deal negotiation with which Enron has been involved.  That serves only as an explanation - it is not intended as an excuse.
 
We remain committed to working with the Creditors' Committee until we can reach agreement on a plan.  We anticipate that negotiation process will take another week or so, and have targeted the week of March 11 to file a motion to adopt a plan with the bankruptcy court.  We will continue to hold retention and severance as our number one priority until a plan is approved by the bankruptcy court.
 
With respect to non-debtor companies, or those companies not in bankruptcy, new severance plans are being approved and will be rolled out to employees in those companies in the very near future.
 
In the meantime, we have been working to finalize merit increases and promotions across the entire organization and plan to communicate those to employees next week.
 
And of course, we will update you on retention and severance as soon as possible.

Hi Audrey,

Sorry I missed your phone call the other day.  It is actually a 14 hour 
time difference and we didn't get to the phone before it went to voice 
mail and we didn't see the message light until the next morning. Sorry 
about that.

I am fine coming home from Dallas at the same time as Steve on Wed 
morning.  If Mark would prefer me to stay and meet with the Aquila 
folks with him on Wed morning, I'm happy to do that too.  Whatever he 
prefers. 

We are having a great time.  Hong Kong is wonderful.  We are eating way 
too much.  We are off to the New Territories today.

Hope all is well.  The big E is on the top news on the international 
CNN channel.  

Have a great day.  Thanks for all of your help!  Kim.

Kim and Eric:
Could we send to ArcLight the models for TransPecos and Sun Devil that reflect what we had in today's presentation? You can either send directly to him (and cc me) or send to me and I will forward on to them.  Everyone did a great job today.  Thanks again.
Kevin

NEW MEXICO
LEGISLATIVE STATUS REPORT

			 The following bills that may be of interest to our
members have been introduced in the Second Regular Session of New Mexico's
45th Legislature, which bills will be monitored during the Session, as I
continue to watch for any other developments that might specifically affect
our industry:

			HB 165-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Representative Ben Lujan, Dem., Dist. 46 (Santa Fe). Would
provide that one liable for the oil and gas severance tax, conservation tax
or emergency school tax on production from Indian tribal land will have a
credit each month equal to the lesser of the tax that is exclusively
dedicated to fund capital improvement projects on the tribal land (but not
commercial buildings) imposed on such production by the Indian tribe, or 2%
of the taxable value of such production. The burden of showing entitlement
to this credit would be on the taxpayer, who must furnish proof of payment
of the tribal tax. This bill received a "Do Pass" in the House Energy &
Natural Resources Committee and was sent to the House Taxation & Revenue
Committee, where it was temporarily tabled for amendment.

			HB 230-"Indian Country" Defined: Introduced by
Representative Leo C. Watchman, Jr., Dem., Dist. 9 (McKinley & San Juan).
Would broadly define "Indian country" under the New Mexico statutes. This
bill was referred to the House Rules & Order of Business Committee, where it
remains.

			HB 309-San Juan Oil and Gas Field Training Program:
Introduced by Representative Nick Tinnin, Rep., Dist. 1 (San Juan). Would
appropriate $300,000 to San Juan College for Fiscal Year 2003 and subsequent
years for an oil and gas field training program at the college that includes
certification and training for well, pipeline and drilling technicians and
field workers. This bill was received a "Do Pass" in the House Business &
Industry Committee and was sent to the House Appropriations & Finance
Committee.

			CS/H 388-Tax Credit For Produced Water: Introduced
by Representative Robert W. Burpo, Rep., Dist. 23 (Bernalillo). A House
Business & Industry Committee substitute bill received a "Do Pass" and was
sent to the House Taxation & Revenue Committee. This substitute bill  would
provide that a refinery, natural gas processor or person who operates an oil
or gas well who produces water from a depth of 3,000 feet or more below the
surface in the course of producing oil and gas may take an income tax credit
of $1,000 per acre-foot of produced water (not to exceed $400,000 per year)
if the party delivers the water to the Interstate Stream Commission at the
Pecos River in compliance with the New Mexico Water Quality Act, to
contribute to delivery obligations pursuant to the Pecos River Compact, and
subject to other conditions, and that the Interstate Stream Commission shall
indemnify the party from future liability.

			HB 423-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Introduced by Representative Donald L Whitaker, Dem., Dist. 61 (Lea).
This bill is identical to SB 369, received a "Do Pass" in the House Energy &
Natural Resources Committee and was sent to the House Appropriations &
Finance Committee. 

			SB  16-Lea and Carlsbad Conservation District Study:
Introduced by Senator Carroll H. Leavell, Rep., Dist. 41 (Eddy & Lea). Would
appropriate $500,000 to New Mexico State University for Fiscal Year 2003 for
a study by the Lea and Carlsbad Soil and Water Conservation Districts of
issues related to the use of water produced by oil and gas exploration from
"deep underground." This bill was found germane by the Senate Committees'
Committee, received a "Do Pass" in the Senate Conservation Committee, and
was sent to the Senate Finance Committee,  where it was temporarily tabled.

			SB 283-Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Senator Leonard Tsosie, Dem., Dist 37 (Dona Ana, Otero &
Sierra). This bill is identical to HB 165, was found germane by the Senate
Committees' Committee, and was sent to the Senate Indian & Cultural Affairs,
where it was withdrawn and sent directly to the Senate Finance Committee.

			SB 345-Well Workover Projects: Introduced by Senator
Leonard Lee Rawson, Rep., Dist. 37 (Dona Ana, Otero & Sierra). Would amend
the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Production Incentive Act to expand the
definition of "well workover project" to include the installation by the
operator of workover equipment that is intended to substantially increase
the life of the well and that has been approved and certified by the OCD,
which approval shall be granted if the OCD determines that the equipment
will substantially reduce operating costs, thereby increasing the life of
the well and its recoverable reserves. This bill was found germane by the
Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the Senate Conservation and Finance
Committees.

			SB 369-Additional Natural Gas Pipeline Systems
Study: Also introduced by Senator Leavell. Would require the Legislative
Council to assign an Interim Committee to study the economic feasibility and
the costs and benefits of financing, constructing and operating a natural
gas pipeline to transport New Mexico natural gas to additional markets. This
bill was found germane by the Senate Committees' Committee and sent to the
Senate Conservation and Finance Committees. 

			HJM 17-Coordinated Oil & Gas Permitting Process:
Introduced by Representative Patricia A. Lundstrom, Dem., Dist. 5
(McKinley). Would request that the Department of Environment, the Oil
Conservation Division and the federal Bureau of Land Management cooperate in
the development of a coordinated permit process for oil and gas activities.
This memorial received a "Do Pass" in the House Energy & Natural Resources
and Business & Industry Committees, was passed by the House, and was sent to
the Senate. 

			SJM 83-Treat Produced Water For Recycling: Also
introduced by Senator Leavell. Would request that the State Engineer, the
OCD, representatives of the oil and gas industry and the Department of
Environment jointly study the issues raised by the potential for treating
produced water so that it may be put to beneficial use and report their
findings and recommendations to the appropriate legislative committee by
December 1, 2002. This memorial was referred to the Senate Rules and
Conservation Committees.

			I will continue to keep you posted concerning any
changes or additional issues.

Hey Guys - A couple of follow up items from yesterday's meeting to update you on.

Affiliates - Transwestern still has the same affiliates as we did prior to Enron's declaration of bankruptcy.  No changes.

Pooling - I spoke with Perry Frazier today to consider whether TW would gain any capacity if it were to do away with pooling.  This is really a moving target because we don't know the exact receipt point of all the gas with a receipt pool on its contract, but Perry will discuss this with his team and let us know.

We have encountered a conflict with our proposed tagline: Beyond Banking.  There is bank in Georgia who has that slogan federally trademarked.  We have slightly revised our tagline to: Going Beyond Banking.  We believe this actually strengthens the tagline and makes it more active.  

Please let me know as soon as possible if you strongly object to using this new tagline, otherwise we will proceed with production.

Thanks,
Stephanie

Kim and Mark,
Butch Bentley, who is on the Panhandle Team, called me this morning and said he had heard on a local radio station that Duke had paid the city of Clovis, NM $50,000 for water rights for a 6 month period.  This sounds like Duke is again interested in building a power plant near Clovis.  About a year ago they were proposing a power plant South of Clovis about 2 miles from our Panhandle lateral.  The proposed plant would be gas fired with a fuel need of up to 100mmcfd.   Later I was told that the project was a dead issue because of problems getting water.
Butch will get a newspaper today and see if there's any more information.  This could be a good opportunity for us.  If you contact Duke, please let us know the results.
Thanks,
Arnie Bailey

Please proceed to issue a Work Order to install inlet air cooling facilities on Units 1 & 2 at the Bloomfield Compressor Station. 
The ambient temperature for this area is 95 ?F and the new coolers should be designed and capable of lowering the inlet air 
temperature  from 95 ?F to 80 ?F ( 15 ?F temperature drop). The anticipated in- service date for this project is May-1-2002. 

If you have any questions please call.

Regards,

Mansoor

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

Does anyone know what the timing of the expenditures would look like? Demonstrating financial ability to fund would be difficult at the current time! I thought we wanted KMI to do the construction? I don't have any real issues with the LOI.

Stan/ Rod, here is the most recent red-lined version of the TransPecos agreement. We have substanially changed numerous items from the prior
red-line and feel this more accurately represents TW's interests. Please review the  document and let me know if you are comfortable with it. In particular, we have softened the language requiring us to demonstrate our financial ability to provide services under the agreement. 

At this point, we are just trying to agree on the basics of the K/M LOI so that we can get the transport rate proposal in front of Pemex.

Earlier today, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message.

------------------------------------------------------
Voicemail Transcript - Steve Cooper
February 14, 2002

Hi everybody, this is Steve Cooper.  It is February 14, so Happy Valentine's Day to everybody. I just wanted to bring everybody up to speed on a number of items - I want to make sure that I keep you all in the loop so everyone has a pretty good sense of what's going on.

First of all, I want to thank a number of you for some very nice voice mails or emails.  They've been very supportive and I thank you for that.  I do intend to get back to everybody personally -- I've just been busy and jammed up this week, but I do want you to know I really appreciate it.  It's been a little hectic this week, so I do apologize for the delay in getting back to you.

Anyway, a couple of things have happened this week and I just want to make sure everybody understands what they are.  Number one is the result of the special investigative report.  We're beginning to reshape the senior management team and as a result Rick Buy and Rick Causey's employment with the company has been terminated.  To the extent that there are any additional changes, obviously I'll keep you up to speed.

We're also in the process of shrinking and reconstituting the Board.  Six directors resigned earlier this week and their resignation is effective in 30 days.  We're initiating a fairly aggressive search for some new directors, which will continue to replace some existing directors and at the end of the day the board will be reconstituted.

At the Board meeting this week, I reiterated that it's my intent in working with all of you to present some restructuring proposals to the creditor's committee by the second quarter, and nothing that I see today leads me conclude that we can't make that schedule.  I continue to believe that there is a very nice re-organizable platform here, so that the company can move forward.

There was some bad news with respect to Enron stock.  As far as I can tell, the claims base here - that is bank debt, bond holder debt and other unsecured creditors debt - is going to overwhelm the reorganized value of whatever platform that we move forward.  As a result, it's not probable that there will any residual value for existing shareholders.  That's not good news.  It's an unfortunate result of this problem, and I wish it was different.  But I don't want you to be misled and I don't want any of you to believe that there is value there, because I don't think there will be.  In particular I don't want you to continue to invest your earnings in Enron stock without being aware of, at least in my view, shareholder value at the end of the day.

The media sometimes interprets the elimination of existing shareholder value as a sign that this is going to be a liquidation.  I don't believe that will be the case here.  I think we have a tough road to hoe.  I think that it is going to require us to rebuild credibility in this company and its management team.  None the less, I do believe that we are going to have a reorganization here, and I'm absolutely committed and dedicated to making that happen.

A couple of other things that I want you to be aware of:  as soon as the dust settles around the reformation of the management team, we will get out a memo as to who the new management team will be and what their roles, responsibilities are.

We are continuing to shape and push forward with the creditors committee a retention and severance program, which I know is important to all of you.  As that gets cemented, I will provide you with additional updates.  

And another thing, I've asked a number of our colleagues to plan in early to mid-March, an employee meeting at one of these local hotels.  It will, more likely than not, be in the evening and it can go as late as you want it to go.  What I thought we would do is give everybody, in a plain vanilla way, a short presentation as to where we are going and how we intend to get there.  Then we will have a giant question and answer session, so that if any of you have concerns, issues, problems, or upsets, we can get it all out on the table and figure out collectively the best way to deal with these things.

That's where we stand as of Valentine's Day.  Once again, I would like to thank all of those of you who have given me some real nice emails and voicemails for your support. Again, I apologize that I haven't been able to get back to you as quickly as I would like, but I promise you I will and I hope everybody has a great day.

If you have any questions or issues, send me an email, give me a buzz or drop by my office.  I would be more than happy to have a chat with you.  Happy Valentine's Day.  Thanks again so much and I'll give you the next update as soon as practicably possible.

FYI

I received a voice mail from Jack Foley at PG &E wanting to breakup the prepayment ($ 1,700,000 ) due December 26 into four weekly installments. My response is to reject that request and walk him through TW with the most current information. This would be similar to what Kevin did with two vendors this morning, Nuovo Pignone and LaBarge Steel.

Kevin Hyatt and I are going for "sghetti" at Spaghetti Warehouse today.  If you anyone wants to go, let me know.  It could be our last lunch together before we all move.  
We are departing at 11:15 if interested.  Toodles noodles (get the pun, Italian food, hee-hee).

Not sure exactly what you said there, pardner, but it sounds delicious!  If
I wasn't on a diet, I'd ask for a double serving!

Weekend is fairly open, as far as I know, but will defer to mi espousa's
social calendar.  We'll be in touch.

Buon colonoscopy, paesano!

What's your weekend like?  I maybe bike riding Saturday AM depending on
weather and my feelings after C'stopy exam on Friday AM.  Other than that I
think we're open.

Well, Rick has made me enough assurances that I have agreed to stay with Enron; I'm calling Conoco this afternoon to advise them of my decision.  Rick and I have a few more items to finalize as far as company assignment (NNG vs. TW).  You and I should have more to discuss on this topic by next week.  I'll keep you updated.  Thanks for you help.

The following items were presented in this week's corporate change control....

Feb. 2
>From 6:00 - 9:00 a.m., the Envision team will re-index the databases.  This outage will affect corporate-wide applications accessing the Envision web query, FileNet Panagon IDM Desktop, FileNet IDM for R3, Panagon Capture professional. Users will be able to access IBuyit and IPayit from SAP but will not be able to view invoices. 

Feb. 16
>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Omaha Infrastructure team will reconfigure the power connections for the Omaha Inverse MUX.  This change will result in a total disruption of IP communication between Omaha and Houston.  The outage should only last for a few minutes.  The maintenance time will be coordinated with the HotTap helpdesk to ensure processing has been completed.  All support staff whose applications are affected by this outage should communicate this change to their customers.  Please ensure they are aware of the possibility of an extended outage in the event the Inverse MUX does not properly re-establish communications.  LAT and DecNet communications for gas control will not be affected by this maintenance.

Jerry-

Just a follow up.

I have not rec'd the license we discussed last week and am concerned as we have been doing some email changes and I wanted to make sure I care for this prior to some travel later this week.

many Thanks

Independent Petroleum Association of New Mexico

New Mexico Legislative Status Report

The following bills that may be of interest to our members have been
introduced in the Second Regular Session of New Mexico's 45th Legislature,
which bills will be monitored during the Session, and I will continue to be
alert for any other developments that might specifically affect our
industry:

HB 165--Tribal Capital Improvements Tax Credit:
Introduced by Representative Ben Lujan, Dem., Dist. 46 (Santa Fe). Would
provide that one liable for the oil and gas severance tax, conservation tax
or emergency school tax on production from Indian tribal land will have a
credit each month equal to the lesser of the tax that is exclusively
dedicated to fund capital improvement projects on the tribal land (but not
commercial buildings) imposed on such production by the Indian tribe, or 2%
of the taxable value of such production. The burden of showing entitlement
to this credit would be on the taxpayer, who must furnish proof of payment
of the tribal tax. This bill was assigned to the House Energy & Natural
Resources and Taxation & Revenue Committees. On Friday, January 25, a
hearing was held before the former, where it was temporarily tabled until
Monday, January 28, at 8:30 a.m., to allow industry and the Jicarilla Apache
Tribe to try to agree on its language.

HJM 17--Coordinated Oil & Gas Permitting Process:
Introduced by Representative Patricia A. Lundstrom, Dem., Dist. 5
(McKinley).  Would request that the Department of Environment, the Oil
Conservation Division and the federal Bureau of Land Management cooperate in
the development of a coordinated permit process for oil and gas activities.
This joint memorial was assigned to the House Energy & Natural Resources and
Business & Industry Committees, and a hearing before the former will be held
on Monday, January 28, at 8:30 a.m.

SB 16--Lea and Carlsbad Conservation District Study:
Introduced by Senator Carroll H. Leavell, Rep. Dist. 41 (Eddy & Lea). Would
appropriate $500,000 to New Mexico State University for Fiscal Year 2003 for
a study by the Lea and Carlsbad Soil and Water Conservation Districts of
issues related to the use of water produced by oil and gas exploration from
"deep underground." This bill was found germane by the Senate Committees
Committee and, on Thursday, January 24, a hearing was held before the Senate
Conservation Committee, where it received a "Do Pass" and was sent to the
Senate Finance Committee.

I will continue to keep you posted concerning any changes or additional
issues.

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Dear Transwestern Staff:
 
    I'm not certain where to direct this request, so I hope you will route same to appropriate group ASAP.
 
    I have some clients (munis in Southern California) who are interested in tradeable rights on SoCal's system and possibly obtaining their own transport on TWPL.  
 
    I have an old (1991) Transwestern system map, and I would like to get an up to date set of system maps (system & laterals, compressors, delivery points, etc) at your earliest.
 
    Please do not hesitate to call me should you wish to discuss this or if there is a charge.

					In a scenario vaguely reminiscent of the California energy crisis,
most of the news focuses around one big story- the continuing Enron saga. 
There&#39;s no lack of stories about the Enron disaster, and each one
seems to be more dire than the last.  With Congressional probes, security
guards posted at Enron&#39;s headquarters and the recent sacking of an
Andersen partner, it looks like the story&#39;s still got a way to play
out.  You can keep up with all the latest including Al Massey&#39;s
ongoing articles and interviews at Eyeforenergy.
<p>
We&#39;ve got a packed briefing for you this week.  After focusing the
last few editions on the developments surrounding deregulation and energy
trading in both the US and Europe, we&#39;re taking a closer look at two
other issues of interest to the energy community-emissions and weather. 
Two of the articles below focus on the growing market in emissions
trading-the first a look at the market, how it&#39;s developing, where the
money&#39;s to be made, and the second article takes a closer look at the
regulations governing the market.  We&#39;ve also got an article on the
latest developments in weather trading which seems to be a growing part of
many energy traders portfolios and is increasingly popping up on Risk
Managers&#39; radar screens.
<p>
All these articles serve as an excellent segue into a few announcements
here at Eyeforenergy.  Just a quick reminder about the upcoming European
Energy, Weather and Emissions Trading conferences in mid-February. 
We&#39;re quickly running out of hotel space, so if you&#39;re planning on
registering make sure to do it soon before space runs out.  Also,
we&#39;re issuing a call for papers for our upcoming Emissions Trading
show in the US... if you&#39;d like to get involved drop our conference

    <font size="2"> <i>January 22, 2002---After receiving mounting
criticism for pulling out of the Kyoto Protocol, the United States is
close to formulating an alternative plan on global warming that stresses
containing greenhouse gas emissions rather than cutting them, sources
close to the government said Saturday.</i><br>
    <br>
    But the initiative to be put forward by the world&#39;s largest
emitter of greenhouse gases is likely to spark further international
criticism as it links emission cuts to economic growth rates and fails to
require companies to carry out reductions.

an three-year $40 million contract with the World Bank&#39;s International
Finance Corporation (IFC) will also provide the Netherlands with credits

treaty to trim greenhouse gas emissions.</i><br>
    <br>
    In signing the deal, Environment Ministry spokeswoman Babette Graber
said, "We are now the first country to use state money to buy C02

Enron debacle are combining to make Sir Walter Scott?s old adage ?Oh what

When first we practice to deceive,? a metaphor for the 21st Century.

    Like schoolboys on the playground the Enron saga is full of charges,
counter charges, finger pointing and blame. The blame game continued in
full force Sunday as the head of Arthur Andersen blamed the energy
company?s business model as the source of its failure.

Stan, 
	I talked to the folks in the field regarding this and it turns out the issues were not with TW but, in fact, with Northern. The Amarillo team will address it with them. I knew we had no issues with Oneok nor did we have capacity available as referenced. Plus, we have very good communications with the TW field operations employees.

Stan................just a reminder to follow up with the commercial group regarding the question about gas going off the system.  While we have capacity, the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers.  There was also the issue of better communication between the commercial group and the field.  They specifically mentioned a situation with ONEOK.  The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them, not our commercial group.

Again...............you did an outstanding job yesterday.

this change is for today only as I have a meeting conflict on another project.  

Let me know please if you can't make it.  We have some interesting developments to discuss including lower cost estimates and additional service offerings.

The following additions have been made to this weeks corporate changes....

Mar. 16

California:

CP02-41-000  PG&E Section 7 FERC Proceeding.  On Monday, Jan 28, 2002, Transwestern will file an intervention in the PG&E FERC filing to convert their current intrastate backbone system into an interstate open access pipeline.

A01-09-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  A Meet and Confer meeting was held on Tuesday to discuss a revised procedural schedule.  Given the ALJ's directive that SoCal must submit a revised BCAP application to reflect the unbundling decision and to include both the LRMC cost methodology and the embedded cost methodology on March 4th, two procedural schedules were submitted to the ALJ for consideration.  SoCal presented a schedule which retains the original Hearing dates to begin on May 21, 2002 and with a final decision by the end of 2002 to allow for implementation of revised rates on Jan. 1, 2003.  The Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) submitted a schedule pushing the hearings back to late August and seeking a Commission decision by the end of March 2003.  The parties were unable to reach a consensus, however more parties objected to the SoCal schedule than the ORA schedule.  An ALJ decision should be forthcoming. 

Arizona:

AZ Legislature.  Due to revenue shortfalls in the current fiscal year, Gov. Hull has announced that  an emergency session beginning Jan. 29, 2002, will need to be called to deal with an estimated $200 million deficit.  On the table for possible cuts are surpluses in special funds such as the tobacco education fund, the Heritage Fund for parks and game preserves and a special lake fund.  Others feel its time to use the remaining "rainy day" fund of $160 Million.  However with a $850 Million deficit expected in 2003, the Gov. wants to keep this fund intact.

Most of you already know but to update the rest.  

Disasembly took place today in IRS's Farmington shop.  Brian Dils was on location as the company representative.  The stator has failed and taken the laminations out.  The rotor has one pole that has failed as well.  

Looking at approximately 6 to 8 weeks to turn around, from the time a purchase order is issued.  Cost for rebuild only is approximately $470K.  This was (according to IRS) a major failure.  Does not include cost already incurred for removal and cost that will be required for reinstallation.  

A recommended scope of work and a detailed cost estimate will be provided by IRS within the next day or so.  Hopefully in time for the next conf. call.

Conf. call 3/19/02 Tuesday 3:00 pm CST (2:00 MST) will be held to update.  877-795-3687  pin 552068

The motor is on a trailer and will be on the road before nightfall.  Disassembly will begin either Sunday or Monday morning.  (Brandy Jones, shop foreman for IRS, indicated it would be more like Monday.)  The team will have a rep on site for disassembly and Todd Ingalls along with Brian Dills will be in discussions with IRS so that an update is available for Monday afternoons conf. call.  

The San Juan Team has done an excellant job in expediting this removal.  

Questions up to this point?  Please let me know.  Thanks

Subject:	#3 Bisti Motor Update

Contractors are on location and making good progress this morning.  The heavy iron used to skid the motor in position for a lift through the ceiling is being transported from the San Juan Station.  Motor wiring disconnects have been completed.   The roof is being removed and the crane should be on location this evening.  IRS has sub-ed Foutz and Bursham for necessary welding, support personnel and some heavy equipment.    The compressor coupling has not yet been disconnected as one final runout will be taken per IRS's request.  Exhaust ducting has been removed and will have to be shipped in for repairs.  (the foam material sprayed in the duct has burned and will need to be replaced)  

Now anticipating a lift sometime tomorrow morning instead of tomorrow evening, if all continues to move along as well as it has to this point.

Subject:	Bisti Motor Update

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)

	1. Do they belong on a template?
	2. Is the template listed the correct one?

Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.

Lindy,

While testing the new CMS TW contract system, we have come across situations with the firm contracts & PNR points. We need to know how marketing sets up the PNR points on firm contracts. 

Do you want all valid PNR points within the path, to be added as alternate receipt & delivery points  on every firm contract or do you add the PNR points only on request form the customer? Looking at most of the Firm contracts in production today, I do not see many PNR points attached as alternate points.

Please let us know how we should handle PNR points for firm contracts?

Thanks Ramona

is no longer a part of Enron which is why their emails have been
returned to you.  Thank you for your thoughts, I will keep you posted. 

 

Kim.

Just wanted you both to know that we received the original contract in the mail today.  Now I have the faxed copy and the original.  Sorry to have been such a pest - - -thanks again for all your help.
p.s. we'll get going on the amendment and we'll be in touch.

PS - I am now zipping all of this info around on my new >1 mbaud link that I
finally shamed the cable company into getting hooked up [only took two
separate visits and plenty of customer "motivation"]  In tandem with my new
1.5ghz CPU, 80gb disk and CD burner, I believe I have moved us into the 20th
century [Alas, I know that everyone now agrees that you are in the 21st in
Houston].

Got the settlement on my old red buddy, but am still grieving and in a
quandry about what to do [no enthusiasm by either partner up here for
spending $$$ after the first year of Prince George's economic slide and the
Enron debacle].

Janell is now improving rapidly and we actually have a small jaunt planned
to Austin that looks very unlikely to be cancelled.  I have a new "look"
that I have been dying to spring on "the group" since before the Italia trip
was scrubbed.  It may be an old look [or gone] before we meet again.

I hope you get to see King Kong in hong Kong...isn't that where he lives??

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Below is an Excel spreadsheet that shows all outstanding November 2001 TW transportation invoices mailed to ENA on 12/03/01 in which they were designated as the payor.  Of the $569,434.56 invoiced, $213,603.58 was through our capacity release program as the acquiring shipper for two Citizens Communications Company contracts.  Another $226,350.00 was for ENA acting as agent for Eastern New Mexico Gas Association, Enervest San Juan Operating, LLC, and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.  The remaining $129,480.98 is for their own contracts with TW.  Please see the attached schedule for the details.

Citizens is aware of their accountability for ultimate payment of the demand portion of the contracts in which they released capacity.

Crude Oil Futures Dip as Kuwait Maintains Output Levels

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.31 to 
$20.07 per barrel yesterday after reports that a fire at a Kuwaiti 
oil gathering facility last week would not affect exports for the 
time being. Kuwaits oil minister said that the 6 million barrels of 
oil in the nations storage could replace the 280,000 bpd shortage for 
about 20 days. It is expected to take 15-30 days to repair the 
facility. Remarks by the OPEC secretary-general that the cartel was 
unlikely to raise production before September because slow global 
demand will not recovere until then also pressured the market lower. 
Traders said prices were also down because without fresh market-
moving news, many pulled out of long positions when news of the 
Kuwaiti oilfield fire drove prices up $0.90 last Friday. In addition, 
weak petroleum products futures failed to provide any support for 
crude. Heating oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX fell 
$0.0150 to $0.5381 per gallon. Gasoline futures for March delivery on 
the NYMEX tumbled $0.0103 to $0.5931 per gallon. In London, Brent 
crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were down $0.17 to 
$19.81 per barrel.

OPEN SEASON

SG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR 
Holdings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage 
services at its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas 
storage facility, known as the Southern Pines Energy Center. The open 
season will begin at 9:00 a.m. CDT on February 4, 2002, and will 
continue until 5:00 p.m. CDT on March 4, 2002. The project is located 
at the border of Mississippi and Alabama with access to the major 
pipelines serving the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeastern United 
States. The facility is ideally located to serve as a transportation 
and storage hub for shippers on any one of nine major pipelines that 
will be interconnected directly or indirectly to the project. 
Information on the facility and the Open Season is available on our 
web site at 
http://www.sgr-holdings.com

Pennzoil-Quaker State Restates Earnings 

    Pennzoil-Quaker State plans to restate results dating as far back 
as 1999 to fix an error in the financial statements at Excel 
Paralubes, a joint venture with Conoco. Pennzoil says the restatement 
will cut into its net income in each of the restated periods and 
reduce earnings per share in some cases.  The restatement was 
necessary because the allocation of certain products meant to be 
distributed between Excel Paralubes and Conoco was measured 
incorrectly and had been incorrect since operations at Excel began in 
1997. The change reduces net income for 2000 by $1.6 million, or 
$0.02 per share, and cut 1999 net income by $600,000, which amounted 
to no change per share. Net income for the 3rd quarter of 2001 
dropped by $600,000, or $0.01 per share, while 2nd quarter income 
fell $100,000 and 1st quarter income dropped $400,000, with no change 
to earnings per share.

Contract Negotiations On-Going at Some Refineries

  
    The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers 
International Union has been continuing contract negotiations with 
some refineries. The union said there was no immediate threat of a 
strike at any of the locations. The union is encouraging locals and 
refineries to use a national pact reached last week as a template for 
their contracts. The contract will not go into effect until it is 
ratified by union locals at each refinery. The workers' previous 
contracts expired February 1st and is being extended on a day-by-day 
basis. Contract talks are on-going at: Conoco's Commerce City, CO and 
Billings, MT refineries; Phillips refineries in Trainer, PA and 
Ferndale WA; BP's refineries in Whiting, IN and Texas City; 
ChevronTexaco's Port Arthur refinery; Frontier Oils refinery in El 
Dorado, KS and an Equilon refinery in the San Francisco Bay area, 
where workers have argued for better compensation because the cost of 
living in northern California is higher than in other areas of the 
country. Workers at several chemical plants and a BP pipeline also 
have yet to ratify the national deal. Most workers at US refineries 
have already ratified the contract.

CMS Energy Reports 4th Quarter Loss 

    CMS Energy has reported a 4th quarter loss due to an extended 
nuclear plant outage and a sharp drop in power and natural gas 
prices. CMS losses of $138 million, or $1.03 per share, were less 
than a year ago when it lost $171 million, or $1.44, after it took a 
$268 million charge for an investment in a Australian power plant. 
Revenue dipped 26% to $2.35 billion from $3.19 billion. CMS has 
projected earnings in the $2.00  $2.05 range for 2002, with average 
estimates by analysts being $1.99 per share. The devaluation of 
Argentinas currency, where CMS has energy assets, may result in a $19 
million reduction in earnings to $24 million, or $0.13  $0.17 per 
share. Profit at CMS Consumers Energy utility plunged 61% in the 4th 
quarter from $193 million to $75 million because of warmer than usual 
weather and an extended outage at its Michigan nuclear plant, forcing 
the utility to pay higher prices for power to serve its customers. 
Profits from CMS other businesses dropped by 30% to $84 million from 
$120 million as wholesale power and natural gas prices nose-dived. 
Energy marketing and trading lost $7 million, compared to $12 million 
in profits a year ago. Natural gas transmission earnings fell 31% to 
$38 million.

Alaskan Lawmakers Debate Oil and Natural Gas Subsidy

                          
    Alaskan lawmakers are debating a bill which would expand a 
program that cuts the state's share of oil and natural gas from some 
projects. The bill would expand the discovery royalty credit program 
which currently applies only in Cook Inlet to the Tanana basin. 
Critics of the measure do not think it provides an effective 
incentive and it costs the state money. The program lowers Alaska's 
share of oil and natural gas royalties from the usual 12.5% to 5%, 
which detractors say is a relatively small amount to those who would 
invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a project, compared to 
other factors, such as price. They also say that Alaska lost $29 
million on the Redoubt Shoals project in Cook Inlet, which had been 
planned before the incentive became available. Backers of the Redoubt 
Shoals project argue that the incentive is effective in luring new 
investment because it allows companies to better manage risks. 
Legislators that support the measure say they are very concerned 
about stimulating the economy in Alaska and say that if the program 
is available in Cook Inlet, it should also apply to the Interior. 
Another proposal, House Bill 307, which would extend the expiration 
date of an exploration incentive credit program from 2004 to 2007 
passed with no trouble. That program would allow the state to provide 
a credit of up to $5 million per project for companies willing to 
drill on state or private land, provided the company agrees to share 
its data with the state in a timely manner.

Occidental Reports $247 Million 4th Quarter Loss

    Occidental Petroleum has posted a $247 million loss, or $0.66 per 
share, in the 4th quarter compared to earnings of $333 million or 
$0.90 per share a year ago. Revenue was down 40% to $2.38 billion 
from $3.94 billion. Occidental had costs last quarter of $282 
million, including $240 million for the planned sale of its 30% stake 
in chemical company Equistar, and expenses for environmental cleanup 
and the closure of a chemical plant. Excluding these items, earnings 
would have been $35 million, or $0.09 per share, near the average 
earnings estimate by analysts of $0.10 per share. During the 4th 
quarter, earnings from oil and natural gas production plunged 78% to 
$166 million from $763 million. Occidental said about $500 million of 
that was because of lower prices for oil and natural gas. 
Occidental's chemicals business lost $4 million in the 4th quarter, 
much less than a $51 million loss a year ago.

Kim - I have my annual gyno appt. tomorrow, Thursday, 8:30 am.  I'll be in shortly thereafter.  Also, remember I'm taking Friday, 12-21 as a vacation day (I get my catheter out!!!).  I've checked with Michelle and Mark and they'll both be in the office on Monday, 12-30.  Is it alright if I take that as a vacation day and then just role the rest (about 20 hours) to next year?  Merci.

Lorraine

BEFORE RUSHING OUT THE DOOR, TO SEE IF THERE WAS AN EMAIL REGARDING DINNER
CLUB! AS I WAS CHECKING SOME OTHER CORRESPONDENCE, YOUR EMAIL POPPED UP !!
CARL JUNG WOULD CALL IT "SYNCHRONICITY" (SP?)!!

EVERYTHING LOOKS WONDERFUL !! TOM AND I ARE SO  EXCITED!!

WE WILL BE BACK IN TOUCH -- WE'LL HOPEFULLY SEE YOU BOTH ON SUNDAY !! (PS
KEEP ME IN YOUR THOUGHTS-- MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PARENTS HAS BEEN A
DIFFICULT ONE THROUGHOUT MY LIFE, AND I'M COMING TO SOME "TERMS OF
ENDEARMENT" FOR THE "WHAT IS" WITH THEM!)

TAKE CARE!
JERILYNN

Crude Oil Futures Slip After 6-Day Rally

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX slipped $0.47 
to $19.58 per barrel, ending a 6-day rally amid forecasts of another 
weekly build in crude oil inventories. Many expected the API to 
report that crude oil stocks increased by 1.3 million barrels for the 
week ended January 25th. In general, the expectations for inventory 
builds across the petroleum board were strong. Earlier in the week, 
some support for the market was found in a report by Petrologistics 
that the 10 OPEC countries with quotas trimmed output by 1.4 million 
bpd, not far from the cartel's pledge to lower production by 1.5 
million bpd. But prices were pressured downward yesterday after a 
survey by Dow Jones that contends the cartels production in January, 
excluding Iraq, will be 22.78 million barrels, more than 1 million 
barrels above its new quota of 21.7 million barrels. February heating 
oil and gasoline futures on the NYMEX, which are expire on Thursday, 
came under increased selling pressure. Heating oil for February 
delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.0108 to $0.5205 per gallon. February 
gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0142 to $0.5669 per gallon. In 
London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were 
down $0.41 to $19.24 per barrel

Refinery Earnings Tumble


    Economic recession, high product inventories and mild weather 
have cut 4th quarter profits at oil refineries, despite lower crude 
oil prices. Valero Energy says January's profit margins were even 
weaker than those posted in the 4th quarter, when margins declined 
40% from last year. Valero reported net income fell 45% to $51.6 
million, or $0.82 per share, compared with $93.3 million, or $1.47 
per share. in the prior year's 4th quarter. Marathon Oil also says 
profits from its 62% stake in MAP, a joint downstream venture with 
Ashland, fell on lower refining and wholesale marketing gross profit 
margins. Last Friday, Ashland reported earnings from refining and 
marketing fell about 32% on lower profit margins. Marathon says 4th 
quarter refining, marketing and transportation income was $221 
million, compared with the $305 million a year ago. Including all 
operations, Marathon posted a loss before special items of $898 
million, or $2.90 per share, compared with a loss of $310 million, or

Petro-Canada Buys Veba Assets from BP


    Petro-Canada is buying the exploration and production assets of 
Germany's Veba Oil & Gas from BP in a C$3.2 billion deal that will be 
funded by debt. The cash deal brings Petro-Canada assets in the North 
Sea, North Africa and South America. It opens the door to a host of 
new international prospects in concentrated areas. The transaction is 
expected to increase Petro-Canada's earnings and cash flow per share 
immediately, allowing it to fund growth and pay down the debt it is 
taking on. It is Canada's 4th largest oil producer, refiner and 
gasoline marketer by stock market value. Last year it bought Lundin 
Oil's Libyan assets to complement its Algerian holdings. It is best 
known for natural gas and oil sands assets in Western Canada, stakes 
in offshore projects on the East Coast and a national chain of 
gasoline stations. Petro-Canada beat out Australia's Woodside 
Petroleum for the assets. Veba produces 175,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day and has proved reserves of 600 million barrels. 
The addition will increase Petro-Canada's reserves by 71% to 1.4 
billion barrels of oil equivalent, and output 78% to 400,000 barrels 
of oil equivalent per day. In North Africa, Veba has production in 
Libya and Syria and a small position in Egypt.

ChevronTexaco Posts 4th Quarter Loss 


    ChevronTexaco has posted a 4th quarter loss, mainly due to write-
offs of $1.85 billion in assets because of lower oil and natural gas 
prices and $1.17 billion for merger costs. ChevronTexaco had a loss 
of $2.52 billion, or $2.36 per share, compared to net income of $2.04 
billion, or $1.92, a year ago, based on the combined pre-merger 
reports of Chevron and Texaco. Revenue fell by 33% to $21.5 billion 
from $32.3 billion. Earnings from oil and natural gas production 
tumbled 73% to $544 million from $2.05 billion. Refining profit 
margins dropped 45%. Merger expenses, estimated to be about $1.5 
billion through 2003, climbed because of higher costs associated with 
workforce reductions. ChevronTexaco has cut about 2,000 jobs out of 
the 4,500 it has planned. Merger expenses of $1.17 billion included 
about $700 million for the workforce reduction, $300 million for the 
relocation and closing of offices, and $150 million from the sale of 
assets. It now expects its total costs from the $45.8 billion merger 
to rise by a third to $2 billion. ChevronTexaco also wrote-off the 
$100 million cost of a computer program. In the 4th quarter, 
ChevronTexaco's oil and natural gas production climbed to 1.8 million 
barrels of oil equivalent per day from 1.74 million. Income from 
refining, marketing and transportation business slid 57% to $215 
million from $498 million. The price ChevronTexaco received for its 
oil was down 39% to $16.95 in the 4th-quarter and natural gas fell to 
$2.27 per MMcf from $5.62. Sales of gasoline and refined products 
slipped 3% to 1.65 million bpd. Operating losses from ChevronTexaco's 
chemical joint venture with Phillips Petroleum increased to $17 
million last quarter from $13 million a year ago, due to a drop in 
chemical profit margins. The company wrote down the value of oil and 
natural gas producing properties by $1.4 billion because of a price 
drop in the quarter. It also lowered the value of assets in its 
chemical unit and properties that were deemed as unprofitable to 
develop by $452 million. Excluding special items, ChevronTexaco's 4th 
quarter earnings would have been $498 million, or $0.47 per share, 
almost half of analysts average estimates of $0.90 per share.

Marathon Posts $898 Million Loss 

    Marathon Oil has reported a 4th quarter loss of $898 million, or 
$2.90 per share, from $310 million or $1 per share a year ago, as a 
weak economy and mild temperatures sliced demand for oil and natural 
gas. Revenue fell to $6.85 billion from $8.05 billion, or 15%. 
Marathon, was split into a separate company after parent USX spun off 
its steel business. USX changed its name to Marathon and will focus 
on oil and natural gas production and refining. It took charges of 
$996 million in the 4th quarter, mainly due to its split from USX's 
steel business. Excluding the charges, profit would have been $98 
million, or $0.32 per share. The average estimate of analysts was 
$0.41. Profit from oil and natural gas production plunged 71% to $117 
million. Earnings from refining crude oil, transportation and 
marketing dropped 28%, to $221 million.

Kevin,

Donna and I are working on the floor plan.  We have you slotted to move with us (although we don't know exactly where yet), but we were not sure if we needed to make space for anyone else that works for you.  An assistant?  Davis Thames?

Please advise.

Thanks,

We will see record numbers of new powerplants coming on line this year. New, much larger RTOs promise dramatic increases in liquidity.

Price volatility will continue, and risk management techniques will continue to be honed.

Subject:	RE: Duke's Proposed Power Plant At Clovis

Duke does plan to build a merchant plant in Curry County, NM.  They think it will be a 2-stage project with each stage 600 megawatts.  The proposed in-service date of the 1st phase is 2Q04.  They will need a minimum pipeline pressure off TW of 500 psi.  Perry Frazier and I have met with Duke reps as recently as Jan. 02 about this plant.  A draft interconnect agreement has been forwarded to Duke who is working on providing their comments to TW.  So far, we have not determined any items such as who will build a line to the plant and pay for and operate it.  I will keep everyone posted as this develops.

Subject:	Duke's Proposed Power Plant At Clovis

Kim and Mark,
Butch Bentley, who is on the Panhandle Team, called me this morning and said he had heard on a local radio station that Duke had paid the city of Clovis, NM $50,000 for water rights for a 6 month period.  This sounds like Duke is again interested in building a power plant near Clovis.  About a year ago they were proposing a power plant South of Clovis about 2 miles from our Panhandle lateral.  The proposed plant would be gas fired with a fuel need of up to 100mmcfd.   Later I was told that the project was a dead issue because of problems getting water.
Butch will get a newspaper today and see if there's any more information.  This could be a good opportunity for us.  If you contact Duke, please let us know the results.
Thanks,
Arnie Bailey

 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/>	 Three trading conferences under one roof...
at the Hotel Okura, Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002	 
 <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/>

Over 70% of European companies
face weather-related risk

Today's business has become all about risk and how to mitigate it. Weather derivatives have become one of the key tools industries as wide ranging as utilities, airlines, agriculture have at hand to offset risks associated with temperature and precipitation.

So how do you take advantage of this new market in weather trading that has emerged in Europe? What key issues do you have to be aware of to mitigate your operational and trading risks through weather? Amsterdam will be the place for traders, marketers, exchanges, brokers, and executives powering the weather trading industry to network with each other.

 	 
Speakers at this event will include:

Aquila, Systeia Capital Management, Mirant, LIFFE, Element Re, Entergy-Koch Trading, Risk Management Solutions, Centrica, Utilicorp, weatherXchange, Aon Capital Markets and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c459583>...

UBS Warburg estimates that profits
from European power trading alone
will top $2.4 billion in 2002

Now in its 3rd year, this is THE conference where the European Energy Industry talks about the business of energy trading. Case studies from traders, brokers, online exchanges and energy companies to help you stay at the forefront of the exploding energy trading market.

"Carbon credits represent a significant asset that companies ignore at their peril"
Jonathan Johns, Ernst & Young

Emission trading options are ripe for the picking - but how can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it - you really can't afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of US$20 billion per annum by 2010.

Eyeforenergy is delighted to bring you this event which will focus on how you can best seize this exciting new market opportunity.

BP, European Commission, Shell, Amerada Hess, Powergen, RMS, Fortum, Natsource, RMC Group, EcoSecurities, Rolls Royce, KfW, Point Carbon, IETA, TransAlta, UK Dept of Environment, and many more <http://193.128.182.100:8081/ss?click&eyeforenergy&3c45bbc4>...

Ordinary Life Gourmands -

We're ready to meet at Tom & Jerilynn's house for our bimonthly gathering of
the Gourmet Group, Saturday, March 23.  I believe the plan is to meet at 6
p.m., so mark your calendars accordingly.  If that is not correct, I'll let
you know.  Directions will be provided before the event.

Kim has doffed her toque long enough to do research on various recipes a la
Francais, and we submit the following assignments pour du nuit:

=================================================
Jennifer & Jerry -

Bring French bread, plus

Title: Roasted Garlic

Servings: 2
Total Time: 45 min.
Baking Time: 40 min.
Preparation Time: 5 min.
Comments:
This a really simple appetizer to make. If you haven't had roasted garlic
before, you'll be amazed how roasting makes the pungent garlic into a
buttery, mellow spread. I like it best spread on fresh bread with goat
cheese on top. Its also a great butter and mayonnaise substitute for
sandwiches, that's low in calories. (Ignore the 83% fat percentage in the
nutritional information below, its counting all of the olive oil, most of
which slips off) The whole head of garlic has only 24 calories!!

Ingredients:
1 head garlic
1/2 teaspoon olive oil
Instructions:
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.  Chop top 1/5 of garlic head (from the pointy
tip).  Discard any extra garlic skin, leaving most of it intact.  Place
garlic head in a medium sized piece of aluminum foil.  Pour olive oil on top
of garlic.  Wrap foil around garlic, encompassing the entire head.  Bake in
oven until the garlic is golden brown and the garlic pulp is easily removed
from its individual shell (around 40 minutes).  Remove from oven; let cool.

plus

Baked Pears on Sugared Puff Pastry with Caramel Sauce
http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=10012

=================================================
Jim & Hattie
Haricots Verts a La Vapeur
http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=11972

plus Red Pepper Soup (to be faxed by Kim to 409-938-3710)
plus two bottles of red wine (French, of course)

================================================
Tom & Jerilynn - our hosts for the evening

pate (purchased), cocktail party toast
2 selections of French cheese
crackers
2 bottles of white wine (French)

===============================================

Kim & John
Duck with Orange Sauce
2 bottles of red wine (French)

===============================================

Sam Cook - is not sure whether she can attend, so her assignment is pending.

===============================================

We look forward to seeing you all there!

Bon jour et bon chance!

Kim & John Watson

I wanted to send out a quick note to let people know that I've started a new job with Delinea.  The division I'll be working with  focuses on energy & energy trading companies and is located in Greenway Plaza (if you're in the neighborhood).  My new work phone # is 713-544-5305.  Also, while I have a new e-mail address here, you can always reach me at rudy@alumni.rice.edu.

Thank you everyone for your help, referrals, and support.

California:

Legislature - Non-partisan Legislative Analyst Elizabeth Hill reported that an additional shortfall of $5.0 billion for this fiscal year is now being predicted on top of the already passed cuts of $2.2 billion as assumed by Gov. Davis.  This estimate is based on further errosion of tax revenues from capital gains and stock options and required payments to schools.  

PG&E Plan of Reorganization.  In response to the CPUC's alternative plan for reorganization for PG&E filed with the bankruptcy court earlier this month, PG&E filed their analysis.  PG&E argues that the CPUC POR contains a $4.5 billion mistake because it overlooks such basic obligations as taxes and interest payments and could only be covered by a large increase in consumer power rates.  Further, PG&E states that the Commission plan fails to budget money for improvements vital to preventing blackouts or to restore the utility's credit-worthiness to enable PG&E to begin buying power again.  Judge Montali continues to review both plans.

New Mexico:

Legislature - In the final days of their 30 day session, the House passed a Memorial requesting that the PRC apply for and obtain funding from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety and to become authorized to conduct safety program audits, etc. on interstate gas pipeline facilities or liquid pipelines.  This is consistent with the discussions held in public meetings last summer/fall by the Legislative subcommittee on safety and is in response to concerns from the El Paso incident a couple of years ago.

Let's use the fact sheet for now - I was hoping to get something to them in the next 24 hours.

Kevin, 

For Trans Pecos, we have a couple of slides with a fact sheet prepared that we used in the presentation with Stan a couple of weeks ago.  Would you like those or are you looking for a 2-3 page narrative?  I'd be happy to provide either.   What is the time frame - how quick?

Kim.

Eric and Kim:
I was hoping to send some information to a potential equity investor (ArcLight) regarding both the TransPecos and Sun Devil transactions.  I have a  very brief presentation or detailed model - nothing in between.  I'm looking for commercial overview, strategic rationale and summary economics.  Do you have anything like this already prepared? If not, is there anyone who could quickly pull this together? 
Kevin

Wednesday afternoon Febuary 6th, 2002, the Enron building experienced a brief power outage.  The building is powered by one of two Reliant circuits.  Yesterday, while a backup circuit was turned off for nearby construction of the light rail system, the primary circuit failed.  Typically, the backup system would have switch on immediately, but because the backup circuit was off the building's backup generators were activated creating what was perceived by some as smoke.  While there was no fire within the building, many employees quickly evacuated the building through the stairwell.  Given heighten concerns for national security, evacuation was indeed appropriate and we appreciate that employees conducted the evacuation calmly and courteously.

All photos associated with the Red Rock Expansion that are sent to Houston should be saved and archived in a central location on the (P:) Drive.  Folders have been set up for each station and some vendors.  When saving new station photos, create a subfolder within the appropriate station folder.  This subfolder should be labeled with a date (month, date, year) and any relevant wording.  If you have new vendor photos, save in the same manner.  

The path is as follows:

P: Drive
	'E&C' Folder
		'Project Data' Folder
			'014630_Red_Rock_Expansion' Folder
				'Project Engineering'Folder
					'Pictures Digital'
						Vendor or Station Folder

FYI--Below is the Press Release regarding Com. Bilas' resignation from the CPUC for health reasons.  With the upcoming elections, appointment of a new Commissioner will most likely become another campaign issue for discussion.  gh




February 27, 2002 			PUC:  	19	
Media Contact:  PUC Press Office - 415.703.1366 - news@cpuc.ca.gov				
				
PUC Commissioner Richard A. BIlas RESIGNS
	Commissioner Richard A. Bilas of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has resigned from the PUC, effective at the close of business on March 8, 2002.  
	In a resignation letter to Governor Gray Davis, Commissioner Bilas said that concerns about the health of himself and his wife have made it impossible for him to adequately and effectively serve as a Commissioner.  "I am thankful for having been able to work in a policy making position in California," said Commissioner Bilas.  "I hold only good memories of the experience."  Commissioner Bilas' term was set to expire on January 1, 2003.
	Fellow Commissioners expressed comments on Commissioner Bilas' resignation: 
"I enjoyed working with Commissioner Bilas and I wish both him and his wife well," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC. 
	"I'm sorry to hear of the Commissioner's resignation," said Commissioner Henry Duque.  "He has been a great asset to the Commission, and I will miss him."
	"I am sorry to hear of Commissioner Bilas' resignation," said Commissioner Carl Wood.  "I wish him and his wife good health."
	"I am sorry to see Commissioner Bilas leave," said Commissioner Geoffrey Brown.  "He was a major force on the Commission.  His intellectual critique was always brilliant and he will be greatly missed."
	Commissioner Bilas was appointed to the PUC on January 1, 1997, by Governor Pete Wilson.  On February 1, 1998, he became Commission President and served in that capacity until March 2000.  
A biographical sketch of Commissioner Bilas is available on the PUC's web site at: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/static/aboutcpuc/commissioners/bilas/index.htm.

As you may know, Jim Fallon and Rich DiMichele have elected to leave Enron.

Effective immediately, Dan Leff will assume management and leadership responsibility for Enron's wholesale businesses, in addition to his current responsibility for our retail businesses.  It is critical that we continue to focus significant effort and attention toward maximizing the value of these businesses.

Bob Semple, of Zolfo Cooper, will continue to stay closely involved in an advisory capacity with Enron's wholesale and retail business activities.

Dan will report directly to Enron's Office of the Chief Executive.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Crude Oil Futures Rally on IEA Report


    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.62 to 
$20.26 per barrel on Friday as speculators and small traders covered 
short positions ahead of the weekend. The market softened last week 
after a report by the EIA of a 2.4 million barrel rise in crude 
stocks as refineries cut production due to poor margins. The latest 
report from the IEA gave the market a boost by indicating that OPEC, 
excluding Iraq, exported 640,000 bpd less of oil last month than in 
December. The IEA pegged production by the 10 cartel members with 
quotas at 23 million bpd, still well above their 21.7 million bpd 
limit. Even though OPEC's cut is less than half of their promised 
curbs, non-OPEC producers only trimmed exports by a third of their 
promised reductions. The IEA says that there are opposing forces at 
work in the oil market, while OPEC and others are lowering exports, 
refiners are cutting runs, reducing demand and largely offsetting the 
export reductions. Reports that Kuwait's state oil refiner would 
shutdown its 200,000 bpd Shuaiba refinery for 7-10 days due a 
mechanical problem helped lift prices. Heating oil for March delivery 
on the NYMEX climbed $0.014 to $0.5334 per gallon. March gasoline 
futures on the NYMEX rose $0.018 to $0.5877 per gallon. In London, 
Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were up $0.51 
to $19.72 per barrel.

Hunt Oil Commissions Study for Camisea LNG Project

    A subsidiary of Hunt Oil, Camisea LNG, has selected Kellogg Brown 
& Root, a division of the Halliburton, to conduct a Front End 
Engineering Design study for a LNG liquefaction facility and marine 
terminal on the coast of Peru south of Lima. The $8.5 million study 
is expected to be complete in about 8 months. The facility will be 
near the Camisea natural gas field, which is estimated to contain 13 
Tcf.  Development of the field and construction of a pipeline and 
related facilities to deliver gas to Lima are currently underway and 
are expected to be completed in 2004. If the plant is constructed, 
Peru would become the first country in South America to export LNG, 
with shipments expected by the last quarter of 2006. The FEED 
contract will include studies from the inlet to the LNG facility, 
through the liquefaction process, to the marine LNG loading facility. 
The design study contemplates a one-train liquefaction plant with a 
total production capacity of at least 545 MMcf of gas per day. 
Kellogg Brown & Root will also study and engineer plans for a 
dehydration facility, an acid gas removal facility, and other 
necessary infrastructure. Concurrent with the FEED contract, 
environmental impact assessment for the Camisea LNG export project 
will be conducted.

Williams Cuts Deliveries on Pipeline

    Williams says it has cut deliveries in its oil products pipeline 
in the Midwest through the end of February and then will re-evaluate 
the situation. Sharply lowered demand for diesel fuel and gasoline 
have led to a supply glut in the Midwest, despite cutbacks in 
refinery runs. Current low prices make it more economically feasible 
to store the products rather than take them out of storage. As a 
result, there is danger of a backup of gasoline and diesel fuel 
supplies in the Gulf Coast region. Williams would not provide 
specific figures on the volumes being cut on its 9,000 miles of 
pipeline that includes 39 terminals in 11 states. In 2001, the 
Williams Pipe Line system moved an average of about 740,000 bpd. 
Currently, there is about 6.8 million barrels in storage, out of a 7 
million barrel capacity for 87 octane gasoline in the Williams 
system. Williams' diesel fuel capacity is about 4.5 million barrels, 
and for the past 2 weeks Williams has carried more than 5 million 
barrels in the system. As summer approaches, the pressure is on for 
Williams to turn around its gasoline stocks. The winter-grade 
gasoline is now in the tanks. The oversupply will make it more 
difficult this year for Williams to turn over the product in time for 
summer-grade gasoline, which must be at terminals by May 1st.

Senate Seeks to Increase Vehicle Fuel Standards

    Democrats in the Senate have introduced legislation to raise 
vehicle fuel efficiency standards and close a loophole that allows 
SUVs to get lower gasoline mileage than cars. The bill, which aims to 
reduce dependence on foreign oil by cutting back on gasoline use, 
would require the vehicle fleet to average 35 miles per gallon by 
2013, up from the current 24 mpg. Currently, the Corporate Average 
Fuel Economy standards require passenger cars to average 27.5 mpg, 
while sport-utility vehicles, along with mini-vans and other vehicles 
in the light truck category, need get only 20.7 mpg. The proposed 
legislation would slowly increase the fuel efficiency of both cars 
and light trucks. The CAFE standards would increase to 33.2 mpg for 
cars and 26.2 mpg for light trucks by 2010, and then jump to 38.3 mpg 
for cars and 32 mpg for light trucks in 2013. The legislation would 
combine the passenger car and light truck categories beginning with 
the 2010 model year. However, heavy-duty pickup trucks are not 
included. Gasoline demand accounts for 45% of the 19.8 million 
barrels of oil that is consumed daily in the American market. Half of 
that oil is imported. Raising the fuel standard would save 2.6 
million bpd by 2020. Republicans have come up with a competing CAFE 
plan that would require an average fuel economy for fleet of 36 mpg 
by 2016. Higher fuel requirements would be phased in beginning with 
the 2007 model year. That bill would combine light trucks and SUVs 
with passenger cars when calculating the fleet's fuel economy, 
thereby eliminating the SUV loophole. It would also allow auto makers 
to trade greenhouse gas emission credits with other industries to 
help meet the higher CAFE requirements. Auto makers say a significant 
boost in mileage requirements would force them to make more 
expensive, light-weight vehicles that they claim would be less safe. 
Whichever CAFE standard the Senate Committee approves will be 
included in a broad energy bill the Senate will begin debating this 
week. However, higher fuel requirements might not make it beyond the 
Senate floor if the parties are not able to resolve differences over 
both the CAFE standard and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge. The Senate will also have to work out differences on energy 
policy with the House of Representatives. The House passed its own 
version of a broad energy bill last August that would allow drilling 
in ANWR and increase the vehicle mileage requirements only slightly.

Shell to Rebrand Newly Acquired Stations


    In one of the largest rebranding efforts ever undertaken in the 
US, Shell plans to spend about $500 million to replace the Texaco 
name with its own logo on thousands of gasoline stations it acquired 
from ChevronTexaco. The Texaco stations will be given a new look, 
similar to those of Shell's European stations and about 9,000 current 
Shell stations in the US will also be given a facelift to match. 
ChevronTexaco sold the stations to Shell after the FTC required it to 
divest the stations and other assets in order to gain approval for 
its merger. Shell says it may either close or sell 10%-30% of the 
retail outlets it acquired in the deal and could trim about 15% of 
jobs at those stations. The acquisitions will give Shell over 20,000 
retail outlets in the US, or about 15% of the market, making it the 
largest retailer of gasoline in the country. It will also be the 
largest retail gasoline operator worldwide, with about 45,000 
stations, mostly in Europe. Shell was also given the rights to sell 
Texaco's Havoline motor oil for 18 months. The acquisition be 
approved by the attorneys general in 12 states.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

I was hoping to send some information to a potential equity investor (ArcLight) regarding both the TransPecos and Sun Devil transactions.  I have a  very brief presentation or detailed model - nothing in between.  I'm looking for commercial overview, strategic rationale and summary economics.  Do you have anything like this already prepared? If not, is there anyone who could quickly pull this together?

In response to where to charge your time to for TW projects, Jim Saunders prefers that you charge directly if possible.  Let me know if we need to discuss.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================

Summary of February 17, 2002

======================================================

Dear Folks ?

   When we gathered on Sunday, I spoke with you about the importance and
value of great questions in our lives. During this season of Lent I am
focusing on themes having to do with the metaphorical movement from -
   bondage into freedom,
      darkness into light,
         Death into life.
   We did take an excursion to talk about the importance of managing one's
state of mind and I spoke about two ways to do that ? how we manage our
bodies and how we manage the focus of our attention.
   Then we revisited the Quest for the Holy Grail story because I had had so
many questions about it. Indeed, I wasn't able to finish what I had planned
to say (we'll wrap that up next week ? along with the telling of another
story I learned from Robert Johnson.)
   What follows is the full text of the presentation.

Much love,

Quest I On

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   When you leave the sessions that we share together here, I want you to
leave feeling better than you did when you came in the door. Better about
yourself, better about your life, better about your relationships, better
about what you do, better about where you live - I'm not talking about the
physical place where you live; though that might be involved.

   I just love this season of the year. In the liturgical calendar we call
it "Lent." It is that time from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday when we make
what I call the journey from bondage to freedom, from darkness into light,
from death into life. So much of our spiritual journey can be put under the
general theme of a journey, or a quest.

   The principles of Ordinary Life are about the beliefs and behaviors we
can have that will empower us to have an enhanced experience of life.

   How can you get what you really want out of your life on a daily basis?
That's the question. Well, it may not be the question but it is an important
one.

   Question. That's what we are going to talk some about today - questions.
The word "question" can be written as a sentence: "Quest I on."

   We are on a quest. We are in fact spending the precious moments of our
lives on a quest for something. Is the one you are on what you want? Really?

   In order to get what you really want, you have to, what? Know what you
want. But even more than that in the belief system we are bringing to our
work in here - as reflected by the Ordinary Life principles, wanting just
anything and everything misses the point. What do you want?

   Most responses to this question are so general and not what we really
want anyway. A lot of people last night hoped to win the lottery. People
think that having lots of money would bring them happiness. But I would
contend that it is not the money that people want. People don't want little
pieces of green paper with dead presidents pictures on them. People want
what they think they are going to get from those things - freedom, fun, the
ability to get with others, to have some kind of pleasure.

   I want to put kind of a parenthesis in here before we come back to the
heart of the matter.

   One of the most important things we can do to create the power, the joy
and the passion we really want to live our lives with is to learn to manage
our own states of mind. If you don't do this, it will cost you virtually
everything you really want in your life - friends, family, success, and joy
on a daily basis.

   What determines how you feel?

   How you feel at any moment in time is purely designed by and the result
of how you are directing your own mind and body at that moment. No matter
what is happening in your life, you are in control - unless you are in
intense physical pain or stressed to the point of exhaustion and mental
failure - of your own state. Once you understand this and use it, you have
control of your life at a whole new level. You can have more fun, joy, and
passion than you ever dreamed of once you take that responsibility and take
that control.

   Some people resist this notion because it is close to the principle of
our having a moral obligation to be happy. It is a heavy responsibility but
look at those who never learned to manage their state. Almost every week -
sometimes it seems like every day - you read in the paper of people who seem
to have had all that would make most happy but didn't learn to manage their
state within themselves. There is a major price to pay in not managing your
state. For example, a tragic event can happen in one person's life and,
after an appropriate time for physical and emotional adjustment, they are
able to let the event go and move on in their lives. For other people, they
seem to hang on to bitter disappointments forever. It is all a matter of
learning to manage your state of mind. In managing it there are major
rewards.

   How do you do it? There are two primary ways to control your state of
mind.
   1. Controlling the way you use your physical body.
   2. Controlling your mental focus. That is, what you pay attention to,
what you think about, what you picture, what you say to yourself when you
talk to yourself.

   Let's talk about each for a moment.

   First, let's see how we can use our physical bodies to create the
emotions we want at any moment in time.

   In order to feel anything in life, you feel it through your physical
body.

   Do this exercise: Stand up. Tall. Breathe fully. Look up. Put a huge
silly grin on your face. Now, without changing any aspect of your body, get
depressed. You can't do it. Changing your body sends a totally different
message to your brain. The way we move our facial muscles, the way we
gesture, the way we walk, the pace at which we talk - all of these things
determine how we feel in any given moment. So when we feel bad, just talking
positively to ourselves or making affirmations is not enough.

   When most Americans don't like the way they feel, they do something to
change their body. Drink, smoke, or eat.

   Find some gestures and movements you can make that will instantly change
your state. These are your power moves.

   How, for example, would you walk if you felt totally successful and
unstoppable? Sit the way you would be sitting if you had five times more
energy than you ever can remember. Breathe the way you would if you felt
strong and excited and energized. Put a facial expression on you would have
if you felt totally passionate and excited.

   Now go from this state to being in a state of boredom. Sit that way.
Bored and tired. What did you change?  Notice.

   Though this may sound weird, this is a valuable skill to have. Developing
new ways to handle your body is a most valuable way to change states.

   Learn how to use your physical body to have enough energy to live with
passion and enthusiasm.

   A second way to change your state of mind and spirit is to control and
direct the focus of your mind. That is, what are you paying attention to
right now at this moment? There is tremendous power in controlling the focus
of your mind.

   We can control what we are focusing on. That is, what we are picturing in
our mind, what we are saying to ourselves.

   If you go to a party the only things you will have feelings about are the
things you focus on. The problem is that you can?t focus on everything. We
become deletion creatures. The price we pay for this is to walk around
believing that our experience of the world is real.

   Some people have, and we'll get into reasons for this in a moment,
trained themselves to notice what they don't want and what they don't like.
Guess what shows up for them in life? What they don't want! What they don't
like!

   If you want the party of your life to be one you are happy with and not
one you are upset with, you have to focus on what makes you feel great.

   The quality of your life is the quality of the state of mind you live in
day to day. How you feel day to day determines how you treat yourself, how
you treat other people, how great you feel about your life. What determines
this is how you use your body and what and how you focus on things. This is
how some overcome tragedy and how others don?t.

   No matter how good it is, you can always focus on something that isn't
perfect or doesn't match your expectations.

   Success is creating consistent pleasure in your life and causing yourself
to grow. Failure is being able to find pain no matter how good it is.

   Understand we are always making decisions about what to focus on. Our
hope is in turning off the automatic pilot and taking control. When you do,
you instantly change the quality of your life.

   In life, we get what we focus on. Whatever you pay attention to is what
you experience instantly.

   If you feel a certain way on an ongoing basis it is because you ask
certain questions on an ongoing basis.

   "Why does this always happen to me?" The presupposition is that bad
things are always happening to you. Do you presuppose things that limit you,
that put you down, or that create consistent feelings of success in your
life?

   The quality of your life is based on the quality of your questions.

   Asking, for example, about a horrible situation, what can I learn from
this that will enhance my life and the life of others as well? How can I use
this situation to help me create more power for me and for others?

   If angry at someone you might ask, "What do I respect about this person?"

   Or, "What is funny about this that I haven't noticed yet?"

   When you ask such questions, you have to be willing really to search for
the answer. Ask with a sincere interest and desire for an answer.

   What could I do today that would be more fun than ever before? To connect
more with my loved ones?

   Here are some questions I use:

   What am I most happy about in my life right now? What about that makes me
happy? What else am I happy about?

   What am I really excited about in my life right now? What about that
makes me excited?

   What am I really grateful for in my life right now?
You will feel a state change when you answer these questions.

   Come up with some questions whose answers can put you in the state you
want and read them every morning.

   You are already doing this. I'm suggesting that you do it in a way that
is useful.

   I want to revisit a story I read to you just a few weeks ago. The story
is The Quest of the Holy Grail. It is a story rich in meaning and
significance. I've had a number of questions seeking clarification.

   When the knights of King Arthur's court had seen an apparition of the
Grail through a veil, they determined to go on a quest to find it. Remember
this is a myth and it is filled with symbolic/metaphorical language. The
knight energy within us serves the king. The king energy is that which
reflects our sense of integrity and wholeness; our understanding of who we
are and what our purpose in this life is. In the story the knights thought,
"We should go out together to find the Grail." But then they realized that
this could be "a disgrace." No, each must go alone into the forest and enter
at the point he himself would choose, "where it was darkest and there was no
path." The vision of and the search for the Grail is the quest for meaning
and purpose.

   Entering the forest alone at the darkest spot, this is the road less
traveled. This is the hero?s journey. These times together in Ordinary Life
are designed for those ready to take such a journey.

   The word hero is related to the words heresy and heretic. All three are
derived from a Greek word meaning "able to choose." A hero is a chooser. A
hero chooses the questions of his or her life and therefore the quest that
person chooses to live.

   For all of us, the question is the quest-I-on. The questions we ask ? or
fail to ask ? shape the journeys of our lives. What distinguishes the person
who is experiencing abundant life from the rest is that he or she chooses
the questions and earnestly seeks their answers. The rest follow the lead of
society.

   My question to you is this: will you live your life from the heart,
develop a heart of compassion, or live your life conventionally from the
prescribed role?

   Wisdom asks the right questions.

   So much of what is important in life is around questions.

   "Daddy, why is the sky blue?"
   "Who made the world?"
   "What would you do if you won the lottery?"

   In the Bible, the questions are so important.

   "Adam, where are you?"
   "Am I my brother's keeper?"
   "Master, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
   "Who is my neighbor?"
   "Simon, do you love me?"

   Wisdom asks the right questions.

   Enlightenment is about knowing the person who asks the question.

   The more expansive our questions, the wider our consciousness.

   King Midas asked for gold. King Solomon asked for wisdom. What are you
asking for?

   The story of our lives doesn't really get interesting until we know what
we want.

   Questions ignite your mind like spark plugs ignite the engine of your
car.

   Is it time to get up?
   What shall I wear?
   What shall I have for breakfast?
   What is on my schedule for today?
   Will she make me happy?
   Will he be faithful?
   What will people think?
   How can I pay my bills?

   Point? Most of our questions are so automatic we don't even notice them.
But they shape our lives. Becoming mindful is becoming aware of the
questions you are asking.

   What are the dominant questions of your life? They determine your life's
direction and shape. So, if you want to change the shape of your life,
change your questions.

   Our automatic questions lead to one kind of life. Here is another order
of questions altogether: "Who am I? What in the world am I doing here? How
can I serve? What is the meaning of my life?" These questions clearly lead
to something else.

   In the Grail myth story the hero is the one who is adequate to "Grail
Quest." His adequacy is not a matter of big muscles or intellectual
refinement, but of a simple, childlike heart. Parzival often seems something
of a fool. The line between the hero and the fool is always thin.

   Parzival is raised by his mother. Even if you were raised by a mechanical
monkey, you have a mother. His father was a knight and came to his end in
the way knights often do. Mother would see to it that the same thing not
happen to her fair-haired boy. She secludes him from knightly things and
stories. Of course, this fails. It always does.

   One day three knights show up in bright and shining armor and the boy is
enchanted. Enchantment is when we fall "in love" with someone or something
with the belief that if we could just possess it or be possessed by it, then
we will "live happily every after." Mother then hopes to have him ridiculed
out of his questions.

   She wants him to give up this foolish business of heroic intentions. Many
people do give up their dreams to please mother, or "mother" as projected
onto their spouses. "What will people think?" kind of thing, you know.

   So she gives him a pitiful old nag of a horse and a ridiculous costume,
one that makes him look exactly like a fool. The tribe never equips us to
leave it. We have to find those tools on our own.

   Every one on the quest must be prepared to face ridicule. If you want to
be sure of yourself, do what society tells you to do. If you want to break
out of the conventional mold you must figure out for yourself what you are
about.

   Some people blithely quote Joseph Campbell's great line that says "follow
your bliss." This doesn't mean following some silly whim. It means knowing
your mission/purpose on this planet and doing whatever is required to
fulfill it.  Campbell became a world famous authority on myth because he did
what was required, in the face of ridicule and much opposition, to gain that
position.

   The heart of the story of Parzival and his quest for the Grail is
suggested in his first encounter in the Grail castle. After various
adventures, Parzival has sort of stumbled into the Grail castle. This is the
wisdom of innocence. The purity of the simple fellow gets him into the Grail
castle. We must indeed become like children. Gentle as doves. But, we must
also be as wise as serpents.

   In the castle lives a king who is sorely wounded. The king's illness has
brought devastation to the kingdom ? it has become the Wasteland.

   All of us, to some degree, get wounded growing up.

   In the process of surviving, the child interprets experience in three
ways:

   The first is in the bonding experiences ? or lack of them ? that we have.
The child interprets the tactile and emotional bonding, or lack thereof, as
a statement about life in general. Is it predictable and nurturing, or is it
uncertain, painful and precarious? This primal perception shapes the child?s
ability to trust. All sorts of factors can influence ? death in the family,
illness, etc.

   Second are the behaviors the child observes growing up. The child
internalizes specific behaviors of the parent as a statement about self. So,
a parent?s depression, anger or anxiety will be interpreted as a statement
about the child. A man asked his dying father, "Why were we never close?"
The father went into a tirade, "Do you remember when you were ten and you
dropped your toy in the toilet and I had to work to get it out?" The list of
trivial events continued. The son had always thought of himself unworthy.
His father set him free by revealing his craziness.

   Then there are the beliefs that are handed to the child. The child
observes the behaviors of the adults around her or him, their struggles with
life, and internalizes not only these behaviors but also the attitudes they
imply about the self and the world. Years ago, I would experience an
uneasiness when my wife bought new clothes. What I got to in my analysis was
a memory of my mother taking me with her to buy new hats when she was
depressed. She would try one on and ask me if it looked good enough to get
her a compliment. Very inappropriate!

   Parzival can redeem the king and the kingdom by asking a simple question..
The wounded king is brought before him, and Parzival wants to ask, "What
ails thee, brother?" But he has been told good knights don't ask a lot of
questions. The decisive moment for him is the choice between acting from his
heart or from his role as a knight. He fails; innocence is not enough, for
he has already been socially indoctrinated. It has caused him to doubt the
promptings of his heart.

   He chooses to act the way he thought he was supposed to. He muffed his
opportunity for the Grail because he was trying so hard to be a good boy. He
goes to bed that night, and when he gets up in the morning, the castle is
empty. As he leaves the castle, he hears a voice shouting, "You silly goose..
Why didn't you open your mouth and ask the lord the Question?" One of the
experiences of mid-life is to "wake up" and discover that the castle is
empty. What we do then is critically important.

   Though a little dense, he soon enough comes to realize that he has missed
his chance. He is really depressed. He could see now that his being so slow
to ask the question as he sat beside the sorrowing king has cost him.

   So, for the next five long years he tries desperately to find his way
back to the castle. He is booed and jeered. Everyone knows he has failed and
everywhere is the desolation of the Wasteland.

   But he is gaining the wisdom of experience, of commitment, loyalty, and
dedication. His journey weaves through a maze-like set of experiences
through which he comes to redeem and understand his past. Holding to his
quest, his question, provides him with the ball of string that he can unwind
and find his way out of the wasteland and back to the Grail castle. You may
well want to find a spiritual teacher or therapist to help you understand
and know the one who is asking the question. But don't look to that person
to provide the question for you. All the answers you need about your life
you already have within you.

   Of course, he eventually triumphs and, in fact, becomes himself the Grail
King. Through his tenacity of purpose, or loyalty to the Quest, he makes it..

   Just so, all who take up the great Quest-i-ons of life and hold
tenaciously to them will enter into a marvelous life, the life of their
destiny.

   For Parzival, and I think for you and me, too; the basic issue is
compassion. In other words, "What ails thee, brother? What ails thee,
sister?" Jesus talked about tending to needs of the least of these, his
brothers and sisters.

   If around you it looks like a wasteland, the way out is through the
heart. If the heart is not the center of your life, you are not really
living; you are inauthentic. This is what the Grail story, and Jesus, and
others, tell us.

   Whatever is at the center of your life will be the source of security,
guidance, wisdom and power.

   When next we gather, I'll make some remarks about the rest of the Grail
story and what the words "security," "guidance," "wisdom" and "power" mean.

   The loving heart, the heart of compassion is the reality of human life.
The desire to be what you are is what begins to wake you up.

   No matter where you go this week, no matter what happens, remember this:
You are carrying precious cargo. Watch your step.

Stan................just a reminder to follow up with the commercial group regarding the question about gas going off the system.  While we have capacity, the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers.  There was also the issue of better communication between the commercial group and the field.  They specifically mentioned a situation with ONEOK.  The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them, not our commercial group.

Again...............you did an outstanding job yesterday.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

Subject:	Shared Drive Concerns


Lisa, Steve Harris suggested I share with you our concerns on the subject of "Shared Drives".  We had some problems on last week with deleted files on the TW_NNG Shared Drive -"S".  The Help Desk has resolved these problems, but in the process, we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  

Our concerns are such that some files should be viewed only by ETS, specifically TW.   Would you please check on this concern as soon as possible?

If you would, please update me on the status of this request.  If you have additional questions concerning this problem, please do not hesitate to call me (x35849).  

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention.

Welcome to this week's Eyeforenergy Update.  Just to refresh your memories,
this update is sent to you, alternating each week with the main Eyeforenergy
Briefing to let you know of any developments on the Eyeforenergy.com
website, including publication of new stories, whitepapers and special
features, as well as the latest news on our upcoming conferences.

If you visit our homepage www.eyeforenergy.com, you will see that our newest
Featured Content is a special report, commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA and
produced by the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research
- Oslo.  This takes a look at the current status of climate negotiations and
the Kyoto agreement, particularly after COP7 towards the end of last year.
It's most interesting aspect for Eyeforenergy readers is how it takes a look
at implications for business in terms of compliance, mechanisms and funding,
even for countries which have chosen not to ratify Kyoto such as the USA.
Scroll down the page to read the full report...

On the same subject, early discounted registration is now available for our
CO2 Trading: The North American Market conference, 18-20 June in Chicago,
which already has companies such as DuPont, Entergy, TransAlta, Natsource,
Entergy and Cinergy on board.  Look out for the full program for this event,
which will be published on our website tomorrow.  We can also announce that
the number of industries who will be talking about their energy management
strategies for the first time at Strategy Energy Management USA is growing,
including the likes of International Paper, North Star Steel, Nestl? and
more.  Keep an Eye on future Eyeforenergy Updates for more information as it
becomes available.

Lastly, we are now taking early no-obligation applications for our
forthcoming members only Premium Content subscription area, which will
entitle you to a discount off the already very low price.  See down for
further details...

NEW WHITEPAPER

An evaluation of business implications of the Kyoto Protocol

This report was originally commissioned by Norsk Hydro ASA, and it's aim is
to present and analyze the newest developments in the climate negotiations,
particularly the seventh Conference of the Parties to the Climate Convention
in Marrakech, Morocco, in October/November 2001, and to provide an
evaluation of what the finalized Kyoto Protocol means for business.

Eyeforenergy thanks and acknowledges the author Dr Asbj?rn Torvanger
(asbjorn.torvanger@cicero.uio.no) and CICERO (Center for International
Climate and Environmental Research - Oslo), on whose website it was
originally presented.

* Strategic Energy Management USA 2002
  Park Hyatt Hotel, Philadelphia
  24-25 June 2002

Energy Management has never been more important than today. As the energy
sector continues to deregulate, energy managers are finding themselves
increasingly faced with new players, new tools and new choices. A solid
strategy which can navigate the challenges of intense competition, online
developments and a volatile market supply is crucial to your business.

This June in Philadelphia, and for the first time ever, all the major
industries will be discussing their energy management strategies.
International Paper, North Star Steel, the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia and Nestl? are just some of the companies who will outline how
they purchase and manage their energy supplies. If you are involved in
energy procurement, make sure you're in Philadelphia this June at the
Strategic Energy Management USA conference and exhibition.

To find out more or get involved, simply register your interest at
http://www.eyeforenergy.com/sem, email Meabh Quoirin at
mailto:mquoirin@eyeforenergy.com or call +44 20 7375 7158.

Kim, Eric is borrowing Kevin Hyatt's TW Tariffs (small) binder.  He has asked me to try to get one for him.  Does someone supply those or do I just need to have it reproduced for him. 

Thanks!

Natural Gas Futures Tumble Lower 


   Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX tumbled 6% 
yesterday, losing $0.142 to $2.307 per MMBtu. The April contract 
dropped $0.143 to $2.348 per MMBtu. The market, caught between heavy 
open interest concentrated at $2.00 and $2.50, sold downward into the 
$2.20s. The market opened down and moved lower. When the midmorning 
cash trading closed, the market  sold down to its intra-day low. 
Trade and local selling left the market caught in the middle of the 
open interest concentrations. Look for the market to continue down 
this morning with expiration likely between $2.00 ? $2.15. With open 
interest spread all over everywhere, options expiration yesterday was 
a non-event.  Look for a withdrawal of about 90 Bcf ? 100 Bcf 
reported by the AGA tomorrow afternoon. A year ago, 101 Bcf was 
withdrawn from storage, and the 3-year average is 91 Bcf. Estimated 
volume yesterday was about 110,000 contracts, about 35,000 of which 
were considered spreads. The market still carries a very high $0.94 
forward carry between March-January 2003. Natural gas for next day 
delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to $0.05 higher 
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub was 
even at $2.40 per MMBtu.

 California Asks FERC to Terminate Power Deals


     California plans to petition the FERC to void 32 long-term, high-
priced power contracts the state signed last year. The California PUC 
has filed petitions under a section of the Federal Power Act charging 
that contracts the state has with 22 sellers are at prices and terms 
that are unjust and unreasonable. With the contracts valued at $43 
billion, the state committed to overpayments of about $21 billion for 
the 32 of the long-term power contracts. Calpine says it is confident 
that the FERC will find the company's long-term contracts with the 
state are just and reasonable. The PUC is asking the FERC to void the 
32 contracts.  The contracts were designed to rescue California from 
having to pay spot-market prices of $300 per MWh or more. Now, the 
average price of the contracts, $88 per MWh, is about 3 times more 
expensive than the spot market. FERC Chairman Wood is planning to 
investigate whether Enron and other companies manipulated 
California's power market and inappropriately influenced the prices 
of long-term power contracts. The contracts also have become an issue 
in the state's governor's race, where the 3 main Republicans have 
criticized the handling of the state's energy crisis.

UtiliCorp Receives Most from MIM Accounting


    UtiliCorp United received the highest percentage profits last 
year from mark-to-market accounting adjustments not yet realized in 
cash among 15 companies surveyed by ABN AMRO. UtiliCorp's earnings 
per share was $2.42 last year, about $0.81, or a third, came from 
MTM. Of that, about 80% relates to contracts to be realized in cash 
within one year, and 87% within 2 years. MTM accounting which allows 
company to take a commodity position and calculate the fair market 
value of 
the position at a specific point in time, despite actual earnings 
that may be years away. However, ABN gave UtiliCorp its highest 
rating for its level of disclosure. Williams, at 37%, had the highest 
percentage of earnings per share in the survey, but that is based on 
estimates, and excludes Enron-related write-offs. Williams has not 
yet reported 2001 results. Pinnacle West Capital was next at 22%, 
then Duke Energy at 21%. On Duke's $1.5 billion MTM book, 38% would 
be realized within a year, 53% in 2 years, and 64% in 3 years.

Many Andersen Partners May Be Leaving 


     Executive recruiters say that more than a thousand Arthur 
Andersen partners have inquired into getting new jobs due to concerns 
about the accounting firms exposure to lawsuits stemming from the 
collapse of Enron. Andersen has about 4,700 partners and 85,000 
employees world-wide. Andersen contends that it is only experiencing 
a normal turnover so far. One recruiting company claims that it has 
received over 10,000 calls from Andersen employees since Enron filed 
for bankruptcy. A mass exodus by its staff may impact Andersen's 
ability to attract customers, especially during investigations by 
Congress, the SEC and the Justice Department into its role in 
establishing limited partnerships that hid debt and losses from Enron 
investors. Andersen has admitted that its employees shredded 
thousands of documents after the SEC inquiry began. Andersen is 
attempting to settle over $26 billion in lawsuits from Enron 
shareholders and employees who claim it failed to warn investors 
about the questionable accounting that led to Enron's downfall. 
Andersen plans to make a nonnegotiable offer this week to settle the 
suits. A published report said that the plaintiffs rejected an offer 
of up $800 million last week. Any settlement could significantly 
lower a partners net worth, and those who were directly involved in 
the Enron account could be sued for their personal assets.

Skilling Tape Raises New Questions


    Congressional investigators reportedly have an October 3, 2000 
videotape in which former CEO Jeffrey Skilling vigorously defends 
Enron's accounting methods and touts the partnership deals now linked 
to its collapse. The tape raises questions about Skilling's recent 
testimony to lawmakers in which he said he knew of nothing wrong with 
Enron's finances when he resigned last August, citing personal 
reasons. In a transcript of the tape, Skilling responds to an Enron 
employee's concern about a Wall Street Journal article. The September 
20, 2000 story discussed Enron's use of an accounting method that 
books long-term contracts as current income. The article also said 
Enron would have had a 2nd quarter loss if not for $747 million in 
unrealized gains from risk management activities. However, Skilling 
says the story is just totally without merit, adding that Enron's 
accounting is conservative and the company provides more data in its 
annual report than anyone in a transaction-based industry. He then 
concludes that the company is in a strong position from an accounting 
basis. During the same meeting, Skilling tells employees the company 
will be bringing in partners to help Enron leverage its capital in 
its new Enron Net Works division. Earlier this month in testimony 
before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Skilling said he was 
not aware of any inappropriate financing arrangements designed to 
conceal liabilities, or overstate earnings. Skilling is likely to be 
asked again about Enron's partnerships at the Senate consumer affairs 
subcommittee hearing today. He is also likely to be questioned about 
other discrepancies congressional investigators have found since he 
testified before the House committee. Also testifying will be Jeffrey 
McMahon, Enron's new president, and Sherron Watkins.

Williams Communications Considers Bankruptcy 


    After Williams Communications Group, which is $5.2 billion in 
debt, said it may file for bankruptcy protection, shares of its 
former parent, Williams Companies, dropped $1.46, or 9%, to $14.84 
per share. Shares of Williams Communications lost over half their 
value, tumbling $0.29 to $0.22 per share. However, Williams 
Communications stressed that filing for bankruptcy was only one 
possibility being considered to reorganize the company. The 
announcement by Williams Communications increased Williams' investors 
concern that bankruptcy could lead to a sizable shareholder dilution, 
or trigger a ratings review. Williams spun off 95% of Williams 
Communication in April 2000, but could be liable for up to $2.6 
billion if the communication group defaults on its debt. The company 
backed $1.4 billion of Williams Communications debt and a $750 
million lease by agreeing to issue shares if its former unit 
defaults. Some investors have filed lawsuits accusing Williams of 
misleading them about its liability for the communications company 
before the spin-off. After a change in the way credit agencies handle 
energy companies rating, Williams may stand to lose long-term 
contracts until it settles the Williams Communication debt due to 
credit concerns by its trading partners. A lowering of Williams debt 
rating could also trigger an immediate pay back Williams 
Communication debt.

Calpine Ratings Remain Stable


    Standard & Poor's has retracted an announcement that it was 
considering reducing Calpine's credit rating, saying the statement 
was based on inaccurate information. Calpine's stock and debt rallied 
after the retracted a statement that Calpine planned to secure its 
new line of credit with assets, which would make bondholders less 
secure. The company's 8.5% note due in 2011 closed at $0.67 on the 
dollar. The notes sold a year ago at $0.998 on the dollar. The stock 
price has dropped 85% in the last year. Shares fell to $6.15 from 
$6.56 following the initial announcement, but after the correction, 
the stock rose to close at $6.83 per share, down $0.28. S&P said the 
company's ratings remain at `BB+' and the outlook for the rating is 
stable.

Dynegy to Sell Shares in Limited Partnership


    Dynegy has filed with the SEC to sell 8.75 million common shares 
in Dynegy Energy Partners. The partnership will operate or acquire 
processing plants, storage tanks and terminals for Dynegy's natural 
gas liquids business. Dynegy Energy Partners expects to use the 
$165.2 million in projected proceeds to pay $148.3 million owed to 
Dynegy and use $13.7 million for working capital. Dynegy owns 55% of 
the partnership. In a move to improve its balance sheet, Dynegy is 
looking to raise $1.25 billion by cutting costs, selling assets and 
issuing stock. The partnership will allow Dynegy to raise capital and 
reduce debt while maintaining control of its pipeline system. 
Dynegy's natural gas liquids business had a profit of $41.5 million 
last year from $3.9 billion in sales. Since limited partnerships are 
not required to pay income tax, they retain more of their profit. 
Dynegy said it expects the partnership to have quarterly dividends of 
about $0.44 per share, or $1.76 per year.

I spoke to Waymon Pong and Ken Ertman with PG&E today about the Electronic Commerce contract and discussed TW's concerns about the broad nature of the terms. I explained that all TW wanted was to have the ability to Nominate in PG&E's system when TW executed a Market Center deal. It turns out that TW has not lost it's ability to nominated in PG&E's system nor does it depend on TW signing the new contract, the new contract was meant to govern electronic contracts on the Marketing side of the deal. TK can continue to do her deals as she does today (fax and phone) and Customer Services Reps. can go into PG&E's PipeRanger system to nominate contracts. 

If you have any questions please give me a call ext. 37429

to be honed. <p>

looks like our window is meeting you somewhere in the 1:30 - 4 time frame

Judy says we're clear.  She has to count the offering so she won't be
out of
church till 12:30 and I may try to get flight #2 in early afternoon so
we
can meet late afternoon.  Were you thinking dinner in the 5:30 +/-
range?

I think we're a go for the May/June time frame.  Kim was supposed to
start
checking airfares yesterday on her MLK holiday off, but got busy doing
other
things.

Maybe we can rally late afternoon on Sunday to get this ball rolling.

I'm not sure how clear Judy was when Kim ask if we liked IT in late
May/early June as opposed to Sept.

Our baby-sitter options are much greater when kids are out of school.
Sept
wipes out Judy's Mom because she can't leave Ft. Worth and puts us in
competition with Jo Lynn (Mom has a trip to Guam sometime in the Fall)

Both are possible, but wanted to make sure you understood it was not 6
of 1
half dozen of another.

In training this week.  Only E-mailing on breaks.

Power and I at Battleship Texas Saturday.  Not sure what we're up to
Sunday.

Kim,
The new TW Hotline was implemented Monday which included customer notification in the form of a Popup message in TMS and a Critical Notice which sent an Email. The new Hotline phone number is 713-853-3044. I was under the impression that Terry Kowalke had notified you of the implementation, TK was also made aware.

John, sorry for the late response, but I think you can implement immediately.  I was in a meeting last week and this was discussed (I don't remember if you were there or not) but I'm thinking that you may have already proceeded ahead for implementation which is great, thanks!  

Kim.

The telephony group has the new TW Hotline number and extensions ready for use, I have the solution center entering the greetings and Terry Kowalke has a new form and procedure for the Customer Service Reps. to use for updates. 

How much notification would you like to give the TW customers before implementing the new TW Hotline phone number?
We can do a Popup notification along with changing the number on the Web page, we can also put out a Critical message which will send an Email to customers. Do you think we need to do more?

Thanks: John Buchanan

Effective 2/1/02 a new company will go into effect called ENNG.  The company code is 179E.

The primary purpose of this company is to account for the payroll of the Enron employees who are currently on company 0179, and who will remain Enron employees after the 2/1/02 transition of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy.  

With respect to coding invoices, recording time and other similar transactions on Northern Natural Gas (0179) please note the following that are effective 2/1/02:
 
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 FAR order or project, continue using the same codes.  No changes here.
If you have expenses that you normally would charge to a 0179 cost center, use the same cost center number except replace the first digit with a 5.  For example, if you would have charged 111222, charge 511222 instead.  These "5" series cost centers have been set up on company 179E, but their payroll and expenses flow into company 0179.  You will not be able to code direct to a 0179 cost center after January business (1/31/02).  
If you are becoming a Dynegy employee on 2/1/02, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 do not enter your time into eHRonline or the SAP timekeeping application.  During the next week or two we will be working with Dynegy on an alternative for capturing and accounting for your time and payroll expenses.
If you are currently a 0179 employee and are continuing as an Enron employee, your time entry for January and corrections to any prior period must be entered before noon on 2/1/02.  After noon on 2/1/02 continue entering your time as you ordinarily would.  Unless you exception code to FAR orders or projects, your hours will automatically go into the appropriate "5" series cost center on company 179E.  

If you have any questions or need additional information concerning these coding changes please contact Trey Meerbott at (713) 853-7003.

	Just talked with Mark McConnell and Lonestar rejected (AGAIN) our lastest proposal
	on the new OBA language.  We are starting to get to a point where
	our customers are being impacted by imbalance issues.  Therefore we
	need to put closure to this issue.

	Mark and Bill Rapp are working on the Volumetric OBA and will try to
	turn this around as quickly as possible.  Mark and I agreed we would continue
	monitoring this point on a daily basis as we have done in the past.
	
	I appreciate everyone's help in trying to resolve this issue.

	If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Crude Oil Futures Dragged Down by Gasoline


    Crude oil futures for April delivery on the NYMEX slid $0.59 to 
$20.48 per barrel yesterday. News that up to 6 additional shipments 
of European gasoline were making their way across the Atlantic, in 
addition to 11 shipments already scheduled, sent gasoline futures 
prices tumbling. Gasoline inventories are already brimming as an 
economic slump has stymied demand. Although demand for gasoline has 
been boosted by strong sales of SUVs, there is plenty of spare 
capacity ready for the summer driving season. Gasoline inventories 
are 12.9 million barrels, or 6%, above year ago levels. Many expect 
the API to report a minor draw in stocks of crude and refined 
products. Oil prices have hovered a little above $20.00 recently on 
concern that the US could disrupt Middle East supply by targeting 
Iraq and fears that OPEC will be unable to successfully pressure 
Russia to extend its production cuts through the 2nd quarter. Renewed 
tensions with Iraq has caused big hedge funds to cover short 
positions in case prices rise. Funds had been banking on additional 
price drops, in spite of OPEC's attempts to eliminate about 2 million 
bpd from the world's supply. Heating oil futures for March delivery 
on the NYMEX fell $0.021 to $0.5251 per gallon. March gasoline 
futures plunged $0.0245 to $0.5623 per gallon. In London, Brent crude 
oil futures for April delivery on the IPE were down $0.39 to $19.98 
per barrel.

Phillips Replaces 135% of 2001 Production

    Phillips Petroleum added 433 million barrels of oil equivalent, 
net of sales, to its worldwide proved reserves in 2001, replacing 
135% of its 2001 worldwide oil and natural gas production. Phillips' 
5-year average production replacement was 359%, while finding-and-
development costs averaged $3.39 per BOE. Phillips 3-year average 
production replacement was 478%, while finding-and-development costs 
averaged $3.00 per BOE. Both the 3-year and 5-year replacement 
figures were significantly impacted by Phillips 2000 acquisition of 
ARCO's Alaskan assets. The company's finding-and-development cost, 
averaged $5.97 per BOE in 2001. The number includes exploration costs 
and significant development expenditures. Phillips says it has 
improved the success rate of its exploration program by focusing on 
lower risk prospects in fewer, better areas. It had exploration and 
appraisal successes in Alaska, China, Kazakhstan, the lower 48 
states, the Barents Sea, and the North Sea, the company said. 
Overall, it completed 42 exploration and appraisal wells with a 
success rate of 62%, up from 45% in 2000 and 38% in 1999. Phillips 
2002 exploration drilling program will concentrate primarily on 4 
areas: deepwater offshore Angola, the northern Caspian Sea, Alaska, 
and the Atlantic Margin of northwest Europe. Phillips worldwide 
hydrocarbon production increased 18% in 2001 to 321 million BOE, up 
from 271 million BOE in 2000. Even with the additional production, 
Phillips replaced those volumes, increasing its worldwide proved 
reserves 2.3% to 5.13 billion BOE in 2001, up from 5.02 billion BOE 
in 2000. Crude oil and natural gas reserves each increased 3%, while 
worldwide proved reserves of natural gas liquids decreased 6%. 
Phillips' proved reserve-to-current-production ratio is 16 years. 
Phillips replaced 99% of its reserves produced in the US at an 
average cost of $5.15 per BOE. In the lower 48 states, Phillips 
replaced 128% of its production at an average cost of $5.08 per BOE. 
The company replaced 214% of its non-US production at an average 
finding-and-development cost of $6.80 per BOE.

OPEC Warns Oil Prices Could Fall Without Continued Cuts


   OPEC's secretary-general says that oil demand is expected to be 
weak over the next few months, further pressuring prices particularly 
in the 2nd quarter. Oil prices have risen 6% since OPEC, Russia, 
Norway, Mexico and others agreed to remove almost 2 million bpd from 
the world market on January 1st. At a meeting last week, Russian oil 
executives and government officials made no commitment to continue 
its export reductions after March. The OPEC representative said that 
if production cuts remain in place, year-end prices should be about 
$18-$20 per barrel. Adding that he expects demand to be flat this 
year or at best, increase by 300,000 bpd. The IEA has forecast a 
growth of 500,000 bpd, mostly during the last half of the year. 
Norway's oil minister has said that no immediate plans have been made 
to put an end to its export cuts and Norway expects Russia to 
continue its reductions into the 2nd quarter. Russian oil companies 
have said they plan to raise production this year. Russia's Yukos, 
favors an early end to its participation. If Russia should increase 
its exports before June, they could find themselves embroiled in a 
price war with OPEC as the cartel tries to protect its market share. 
Typically, the 2nd quarter is the weakest for oil demand, sandwiched 
between the winter heating season and the heavy summer travel period. 
The secretary-general said that without the export reductions and 
Russia's contribution, OPEC could not have achieved its $19.00 per 
barrel average price this year.

Canadian Oil Company Signs Iranian Deal

    A small Canadian oil company, Sheer Energy, has received approval 
from Iran to develop Masjed-I-Suleyman, the first oil field 
discovered in the Middle East back in 1908. In a deal made with the 
National Iranian Oil Company, Sheer will be the operator and will 
have a 49% interest in the project. A NIOC subsidiary will own the 
remainder. Masjed-I-Suleyman currently produces 4,500 bpd. With $88 
million slated to be spent over 4 years on a reservoir study, 
vertical and horizontal drilling and new water re-injection 
facilities, the companies are looking to add 20,000 bpd to 
production. The field is estimated to hold 6 billion barrels, 1.2 
billion of which have been produced. But Sheer will produce only a 
small portion of the remaining reserves. The project is the 2nd 
between Canadian oil companies and Iran. Bow Valley Energy is 
developing the Balal field with TotalFinaElf and Italy's ENI for an 
estimated $300 million. In 1999, the US administration warned Bow 
Valley that it could be punished under the Iran and Libya Sanctions 
Act, which allows the US to sanction foreign companies that invest 
more than $20 million per year in the energy sectors of the 2 
countries. Sheer, which was created specifically to look for Iranian 
oil deals, is not likely to be sanctioned because its share of 
expenditures would be below the limit over the 4 years of the 
contract. Under the agreement, Sheer will receive payments from 
future oil sales for 3 years after the project is completed. The 
amount will be based on an agreed rate of return at the target 
production level.

Helmerich & Payne Unit to Acquire Key 

   Oklahoma drilling contractor, Helmerich & Payne, plans to spin-off 
a subsidiary that produces oil and natural gas. The new company, 
called Cimarex Energy, will acquire Key Production in a $220 million 
transaction. Helmerich shareholders will receive 0.53 shares of 
Cimarex for each share, while Key investors will get one Cimarex 
share for each Key share. Cimarex will be owned 65% by Helmerich 
shareholders and 35% by Key investors. Helmerich sought the spin-off 
to separate exploration and production from its biggest source of 
revenue, drilling wells for other producers. Its oil and natural gas 
business had a 1st quarter loss of about $4 million, compared with 
operating profit of $27 million a year earlier. The acquisition gives 
Key a bigger asset base to explore and produce in the Gulf of Mexico. 
The 9-member Cimarex board will have 5 members from Helmerich & Payne 
and 4 appointed by Key.

Pemex to Raise Output by End of Year


    Last week, Pemex announced plans to raise its crude oil 
production to 3.62 million bpd by the end this year. The Energy 
Minister says that the increase will not affect Mexico's commitment 
to the export agreement, which runs through June. Of Pemex's January 
crude output, 2.2 million bpd was heavy crude, 590,000 bpd was light 
crude and 468,000 bpd super-light crude. Last month, Pemex exported 
39,000 bpd of light Isthmus crude at $17.88 per barrel, 1.29 million 
bpd of heavy Maya crude oil at $14.08 per barrel, and 261,000 bpd of 
super-light Olmeca crude oil at $18.79 per barrel. Exports to the US 
averaged 1.35 million bpd in January, compared with 1.45 million bpd 
in December, and 1.56 million bpd in January 2001.

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
   Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX tumbled 6% yesterday, losing $0.142 to $2.307 per MMBtu. The April contract dropped $0.143 to $2.348 per MMBtu. The market, caught between heavy open interest concentrated at $2.00 and $2.50, sold downward into the $2.20s. The market opened down and moved lower. When the midmorning cash trading closed, the market  sold down to its intra-day low. Trade and local selling left the market caught in the middle of the open interest concentrations. Look for the market to continue down this morning with expiration likely between $2.00  $2.15. With open interest spread all over everywhere, options expiration yesterday was a non-event.  Look for a withdrawal of about 90 Bcf  100 Bcf reported by the AGA tomorrow afternoon. A year ago, 101 Bcf was withdrawn from storage, and the 3-year average is 91 Bcf. Estimated volume yesterday was about 110,000 contracts, about 35,000 of which were considered spreads. The market still carries a !
very high $0.94 forward carry between March-January 2003. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub was even at $2.40 per MMBtu.</FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
     California plans to petition the FERC to void 32 long-term, high-priced power contracts the state signed last year. The California PUC has filed petitions under a section of the Federal Power Act charging that contracts the state has with 22 sellers are at prices and terms that are unjust and unreasonable. With the contracts valued at $43 billion, the state committed to overpayments of about $21 billion for the 32 of the long-term power contracts. Calpine says it is confident that the FERC will find the company's long-term contracts with the state are just and reasonable. The PUC is asking the FERC to void the 32 contracts.  The contracts were designed to rescue California from having to pay spot-market prices of $300 per MWh or more. Now, the average price of the contracts, $88 per MWh, is about 3 times more expensive than the spot market. FERC Chairman Wood is planning to investigate whether Enron and other companies manipulated California's power market and inappropr!
iately influenced the prices of long-term power contracts. The contracts also have become an issue in the state's governor's race, where the 3 main Republicans have criticized the handling of the states energy crisis. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    UtiliCorp United received the highest percentage profits last year from mark-to-market accounting adjustments not yet realized in cash among 15 companies surveyed by ABN AMRO. UtiliCorps earnings per share was $2.42 last year, about $0.81, or a third, came from MTM. Of that, about 80% relates to contracts to be realized in cash within one year, and 87% within 2 years. MTM accounting which allows company to take a commodity position and calculate the fair market value of <BR>
the position at a specific point in time, despite actual earnings that may be years away. However, ABN gave UtiliCorp its highest rating for its level of disclosure. Williams, at 37%, had the highest percentage of earnings per share in the survey, but that is based on estimates, and excludes Enron-related write-offs. Williams has not yet reported 2001 results. Pinnacle West Capital was next at 22%, then Duke Energy at 21%. On Duke's $1.5 billion MTM book, 38% would be realized within a year, 53% in 2 years, and 64% in 3 years. <BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
     Executive recruiters say that more than a thousand Arthur Andersen partners have inquired into getting new jobs due to concerns about the accounting firms exposure to lawsuits stemming from the collapse of Enron. Andersen has about 4,700 partners and 85,000 employees world-wide. Andersen contends that it is only experiencing a normal turnover so far. One recruiting company claims that it has received over 10,000 calls from Andersen employees since Enron filed for bankruptcy. A mass exodus by its staff may impact Andersens ability to attract customers, especially during investigations by Congress, the SEC and the Justice Department into its role in establishing limited partnerships that hid debt and losses from Enron investors. Andersen has admitted that its employees shredded thousands of documents after the SEC inquiry began. Andersen is attempting to settle over $26 billion in lawsuits from Enron shareholders and employees who claim it failed to warn investors about t!
he questionable accounting that led to Enron's downfall. Andersen plans to make a nonnegotiable offer this week to settle the suits. A published report said that the plaintiffs rejected an offer of up $800 million last week. Any settlement could significantly lower a partners net worth, and those who were directly involved in the Enron account could be sued for their personal assets. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    Congressional investigators reportedly have an October 3, 2000 videotape in which former CEO Jeffrey Skilling vigorously defends Enrons accounting methods and touts the partnership deals now linked to its collapse. The tape raises questions about Skillings recent testimony to lawmakers in which he said he knew of nothing wrong with Enron's finances when he resigned last August, citing personal reasons. In a transcript of the tape, Skilling responds to an Enron employees concern about a Wall Street Journal article. The September 20, 2000 story discussed Enron's use of an accounting method that books long-term contracts as current income. The article also said Enron would have had a 2nd quarter loss if not for $747 million in unrealized gains from risk management activities. However, Skilling says the story is just totally without merit, adding that Enron's accounting is conservative and the company provides more data in its annual report than anyone in a transaction-based!
 industry. He then concludes that the company is in a strong position from an accounting basis. During the same meeting, Skilling tells employees the company will be bringing in partners to help Enron leverage its capital in its new Enron Net Works division. Earlier this month in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Skilling said he was not aware of any inappropriate financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities, or overstate earnings. Skilling is likely to be asked again about Enron's partnerships at the Senate consumer affairs subcommittee hearing today. He is also likely to be questioned about other discrepancies congressional investigators have found since he testified before the House committee. Also testifying will be Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's new president, and Sherron Watkins. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#001020" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    After Williams Communications Group, which is $5.2 billion in debt, said it may file for bankruptcy protection, shares of its former parent, Williams Companies, dropped $1.46, or 9%, to $14.84 per share. Shares of Williams Communications lost over half their value, tumbling $0.29 to $0.22 per share. However, Williams Communications stressed that filing for bankruptcy was only one possibility being considered to reorganize the company. The announcement by Williams Communications increased Williams investors concern that bankruptcy could lead to a sizable shareholder dilution, or trigger a ratings review. Williams spun off 95% of Williams Communication in April 2000, but could be liable for up to $2.6 billion if the communication group defaults on its debt. The company backed $1.4 billion of Williams Communications debt and a $750 million lease by agreeing to issue shares if its former unit defaults. Some investors have filed lawsuits accusing Williams of misleading them a!
bout its liability for the communications company before the spin-off. After a change in the way credit agencies handle energy companies rating, Williams may stand to lose long-term contracts until it settles the Williams Communication debt due to credit concerns by its trading partners. A lowering of Williams debt rating could also trigger an immediate pay back Williams Communication debt.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    Dynegy has filed with the SEC to sell 8.75 million common shares in Dynegy Energy Partners. The partnership will operate or acquire processing plants, storage tanks and terminals for Dynegys natural gas liquids business. Dynegy Energy Partners expects to use the $165.2 million in projected proceeds to pay $148.3 million owed to Dynegy and use $13.7 million for working capital. Dynegy owns 55% of the partnership. In a move to improve its balance sheet, Dynegy is looking to raise $1.25 billion by cutting costs, selling assets and issuing stock. The partnership will allow Dynegy to raise capital and reduce debt while maintaining control of its pipeline system. Dynegys natural gas liquids business had a profit of $41.5 million last year from $3.9 billion in sales. Since limited partnerships are not required to pay income tax, they retain more of their profit. Dynegy said it expects the partnership to have quarterly dividends of about $0.44 per share, or $1.76 per year. </FON!

Crude Oil Futures Jump on Kuwaiti Oil Fire


Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.90 to 
$20.38 per barrel on Friday after reports of a fire at a Kuwaiti oil 
field gathering center for petroleum supplies. Short-term supply 
disruptions are expected from the 600,000 bpd of oil output lost due 
to the pipeline explosion. Some say that the Kuwaiti fire appears to 
have driven several of the huge trading funds to cover their short 
positions. In addition, the market gained support from a prediction 
by OPEC's secretary-general that oil demand would climb by 500,000 
bpd this year. But a senior OPEC official warned that if any major 
producers flooded the market with crude oil or products that other 
producers would follow suit to avoid losing market share. Rival 
producers fear that Russia, which has promised to cut 150,000 bpd of 
crude supply, could unleash exports of refined products, while still 
technically sticking to their crude oil curbs. However, US economic 
data showing a jump in consumer sentiment and a dip in unemployment 
rates also provided the market with a boost. News that a threatened 
strike by the Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers 
International union was averted appeared to have a minimal effect on 
the market. Heating oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX rose 
$0.0215 to $0.5531 per gallon. March gasoline futures on the NYMEX 
gained $ 0.0292 to $0.6034 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil 
futures on the IPE were up $0.80 to $19.98 per barrel.

OPEN SEASON

SG Resources Mississippi, L.L.C., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGR 
Holdings, L.L.C., is conducting an open season for firm storage 
services at its new high-deliverability, salt cavern, natural gas 
storage facility, known as the Southern Pines Energy Center. The open 
season will begin at 9:00 a.m. CDT on February 4, 2002, and will 
continue until 5:00 p.m. CDT on March 4, 2002. The project is located 
at the border of Mississippi and Alabama with access to the major 
pipelines serving the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeastern United 
States. The facility is ideally located to serve as a transportation 
and storage hub for shippers on any one of nine major pipelines that 
will be interconnected directly or indirectly to the project. 
Information on the facility and the Open Season is available on our 
web site at

New Agreement Averts Strike at Refineries

    Shell has negotiated a contract agreement with the 30,000 member 
Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers union, averting 
the first nationwide strike against US oil refiners since 1980. The 
union had threatened to strike refineries owned by ChevronTexaco, 
Exxon Mobil, BP and Phillips at midnight Thursday. The agreement 
between Shell and the union will be used as a model for contracts 
with other companies. Just hours before the negotiation's deadline, 
the union rescinded its threat of strike, which allowed talks to 
continue. Terms of the 4-year contract include pay raises of $0.85 
per hour in the first year with hikes of 3.5%, 3.7% and 4% in 
subsequent years. The contract also increased the benefit for death 
resulting from a work accident to $500,000 from $250,000. Workers at 
153 oil and natural gas refineries and terminals will be affected by 
the deal.

World Heating Fuel Outlook              
 
    Arctic temperatures moving into eastern Canada will increase 
demand for heating oil in Quebec, Ontario and the northeastern US 
through next week. Warmer than usual temperatures will continue in 
much of Europe, but a cold snap in western Europe early next week 
will boost heating fuel usage for a few days. In the US, cold air 
will cover most of the northeast and northern portions of the country 
producing a hefty increase in heating fuel demand. A warm air mass in 
the southwest will reduce the high usage seen the past week. In 
Canada the coldest air mass of the season will continue in the 
eastern provinces during the next week. Heating fuel demand will 
remain above normal as warmer temperatures in the west lower usage 
slightly. In Europe, average heating fuel demand will stay below 
normal across much of the continent as temperatures 3? - 8? above 
normal continue through next week. A cold front in western Europe at 
the beginning of this week will bump up usage for a few days. In 
China, cooler weather will continue to move across much of the nation 
as relatively cold temperatures persist in the west central regions. 
The chilly weather will keep heating fuel usage above normal. 
Temperatures in Japan are expected to be 2? - 4? below normal through 
next week producing slightly above normal heating fuel 
consumption.

Qatar Warns Non-OPEC Oil Exporters 


   Qatar's oil minister says that if any major oil producer flooded 
international markets with crude oil or refined products, OPEC would 
suspend its supply cuts in March. OPEC implemented its 4th successive 
production cut last month after a negotiated agreement with other 
exporters including Russia, Mexico and Norway. Russia says it plans 
to increase exports of refined oil to ease a glut on its domestic 
market, despite its agreement with OPEC. Last week, Russia cut in 
half its export duties for fuel oil, having cut tariffs on other 
product exports earlier. The OPEC oil ministers are due to meet next 
on March 15th. Qatar now says $20 ? $22 per barrel is a reasonable 
target for OPEC's reference basket of crude oils, well below the 
cartel's official range of $22 ? $28 per barrel.

CFTC To Restructure 

    The Commodity Futures Trading Commission plans to restructure to 
implement a major overhaul of futures laws passed by Congress in 
2000. The legislation deregulated futures and derivatives markets to 
help better face growing global competition. It also changes the 
CFTC's role from a front-line regulator to more of an oversight 
agency. The functions previously performed by the agency's divisions 
of Trading and Markets and Economic Analysis will be performed by 2 
new divisions and one new office.

Administration Considering New Fuel Standards
 
    In a move that seems to please neither environmentalists nor auto 
makers, the administration is asking Congress for authority to rework 
the CAFE system, established in 1975 to set fuel economy standards. 
In a letter to congressional leaders, the transportation secretary 
cited a report by the National Academy of Sciences, which said that 
current fuel economy could be improved by existing technology. But he 
also pointed out that the panel said that CAFE has produced smaller 
and lighter cars, resulting in more traffic deaths. He said that the 
DOT is deeply concerned about the adverse impact that CAFE has had on 
safety. According to CAFE standards cars must get at least 27.5 mpg, 
while pickups, minivans and SUVs must get 20.7 mpg. Auto makers are 
not required to meet the standard for each model, but must meet the 
average for their entire fleet. Lighter automobiles with better 
mileage offset heavier gas-guzzling vehicles. The DOT secretary said 
that a new standard could be weight-based, so as to not encourage 
manufacturers to build smaller cars to meet the standard. The 
secretary is seeking an increased the budget to revise the standards. 
Environmentalists are not encouraged however, skeptically arguing 
that the administration is trying to head off a Senate vote on CAFE 
standards and preserve oil imports from Saudi Arabia. They also 
contend that the administration is unwilling to take sensible steps 
to cut out oil dependence. Auto manufacturers say that the proposals 
would just create different winners and losers depending on the rules 
and that there are a lot of details that need to be examined.

Canadian Oil Stocks End Week with Rally


    Canadian energy stock prices jumped higher Friday along with oil 
prices. Merger partners PanCanadian Energy and Alberta Energy were 
among the top movers at the end of a week of big deals. The TSE's oil 
and natural gas sub-index jumped more than 150 points, or 1.7%, to 
9109.44, the highest level since December. The rally came as oil rose 
to a 3-week high. WTI crude oil climbed $0.90 per barrel to close at 
$20.38 after OPEC forecast a modest increase of 500,000 bpd in oil 
demand in 2002 over 2001. OPEC says the most likely outcome of its 
March 15th meeting would be no change in the output quotas. Shares in 
PanCanadian and AEC both rose about 4%. The proposed combined company 
will be called EnCana Corp. Petro-Canada, which agreed last week to 
buy the international assets of Veba Oil & Gas for C$3.2 billion, 
rose C$0.19 to C$36.54. Nexen also jumped 4%, up C$1.29 to C$32.59 
after a 4.3% increase on Thursday. Baytex Energy jumped more than 5% 
to C$4.73.

San Juan Team,

Do you have a pig run scheduled in the next day or two?

Subject:	RE: San Juan Pigging/DRA

I am attaching a profile of the efficiencies between Bloomfield and Bisti for Feb 22-
March 11.

 << File: sj3.doc >> 
Summary
1)	Before pigging, (i.e. 21-27th), the efficiency was about 96.5%
2)	After the pig run on the 27th, the efficiency increased to about 102% for two days.
3)	It averaged about 101% for the next 6 days (i.e. 28th-5th March).  
4)	It then steadily plummeted to 98% over a 3-day period - a percent degradation a day! (5th-8th March)
5)	It remains around the 98% average today.

Essentially, the high efficiency resulting from the 27th Feb pigging lasted just about a week.
The targeted efficiency for this section is 103%.

At the TW commercial meeting this afternoon, we indicated that applying the DRA around the end of May (together with other planned outages) may be the way to go. Meanwhile,  I believe we should schedule another pig run as soon as we can. 
I did also receive the sample collected from the last pig run. I will have it analyzed and report on our findings.

Please let me know any thoughts you may have on this issue

ben

We kicked a pig down the San Juan Lat. on 2-27-02 @ 08:03 MST Pressure was 1145 PSI, Flow of 840.  It was a newly rebuild pig and was kicked dry.   Bisti was down for 55 min, and the pig went by Bisti @ 10:26 MST.  Data at each valve site retreved off RTUs.   If you have any questions or comments, please call.

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Lisa, Steve Harris suggested I share with you our concerns on the subject of "Shared Drives".  We had some problems on last week with deleted files on the TW_NNG Shared Drive -"S".  The Help Desk has resolved these problems, but in the process, we noticed that some of the files on the shared drive were still being viewed and updated by NNG's personnel over in Dynegy's offices.  

Our concerns are such that some files should be viewed only by ETS, specifically TW.   Would you please check on this concern as soon as possible?

If you would, please update me on the status of this request.  If you have additional questions concerning this problem, please do not hesitate to call me (x35849).  

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention.

Crude Oil Futures Rally on Middle East Tensions

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX climbed $0.45 
to $21.18 per barrel yesterday after President Bush said the US would 
take whatever action it deemed necessary to defend itself against 
Saddam Hussein. The rally drove speculative funds to cover short 
positions in the event prices continue to rise. Some traders worried 
that any action against Iraq could further anti-American sentiment in 
the Arab world, which could affect oil exports. Fears were further 
exacerbated by increasing tensions between Israeli and Palestinian 
forces. Israeli troops raided 3 Palestinian towns in response to a 
recent rocket attack on Israel. The problems in the middle east 
overshadowed news of bulging inventories in the most current 
inventory reports. According to the API crude supplies rose 4.7 
million while the EIA reported a much lower 2.5 million barrel 
increase. Distillate inventories increased 604,000 barrels according 
to the API and by 200,000 in the EIA report after most had expected a 
sizable withdrawal because of colder weather across much of the 
nation last week. Gasoline stocks climbed by 1.7 million in API data 
and by 1 million according the EIA, while many had expected a draw of 
up to 2 million barrels. Heating oil futures for March delivery on 
the NYMEX added $0.008 to $0.554 per gallon. March gasoline futures 
on the NYMEX rose $0.0071 to $0.609 per gallon. In London, Brent 
crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were up$0.24 to 
$20.70 per barrel.

ChevronTexaco Postpones Canadian Oil Project
  
    ChevronTexaco has postponed development of the proposed 414 
million barrel Hebron-Ben Nevis oil project off Newfoundland, saying 
that with oil prices at their current low levels, the project is not 
financially feasible. ChevronTexaco made the move after one of its 
partners in the project, ExxonMobil, decided to sell several of its 
exploration licenses in the area. Norsk Hydro and Petro-Canada are 
the other partners in the venture. ChevronTexaco says that since 
about 75% of the recoverable reserves in the field are heavy oil, 
current technology would require additional wells to be drilled, 
which would add significantly to the costs. Three fields, Hebron, Ben 
Nevis and West Ben Nevis make up the prospect. All were discovered in 
the early to mid 1980s. The oil field would have been the 4th major 
development on the Grand Banks off Canada's east coast. Hibernia, 
which was the 1st major oil project offshore Newfoundland came on 
line in 1997 and currently produces about 180,000 bpd. The 2nd, Terra 
Nova, ran $566 million over budget and began producing last month 
after a years delay. The 3rd field, White Rose, a joint venture of 
Husky Energy and Petro-Canada, has received regulatory approval, but 
no decision has been made to proceed with the project. ChevronTexaco 
says that when prices improve it may revisit the project.

US Companies to Renegotiate Libyan Contracts 

   The State Department has given Conoco, Marathon Oil and Amerada 
Hess permission to begin renegotiating dormant oil production 
contracts with Libya. Last September, Libya warned the  companies, 
which own stakes in Libyan oil through their Oasis Group venture, 
that they would lose the concessions in a year unless they returned. 
They were forced to leave in the mid-1980s after Libia was declared a 
terrorist state. The Oasis Group will begin discussing with Libya the 
terms under which it could return. However, this is not a change in 
US policy toward Libya, and does not give the Oasis Group the 
authority to return just yet. Marathon and Conocoeach own 16.33% of 
the group. Amerada Hess owns 8.16 % and the Libyan government owns 
the remainder. European rivals such as Austria's OMV, Spain's Repsol-
YPF and Total Fina Elf of France, produce oil in the country. The 
United Nations suspended economic sanctions on Libya in 1999.

Democrats Seek to Regulate OTC 
  

    Several Democratic senators plan to introduce legislation to 
regulate the OTC trading of derivatives. Derivatives are customized 
financial contracts whose values are connected to the price of 
underlying commodities and are traded privately among companies, not 
on regulated exchanges. The proposed legislation is an attempt to 
eliminate a Congressional exemption that allowed energy traders to 
avoid scrutiny by the CFTC when trading derivatives. The bill would 
give the CFTC regulatory oversight authority over futures trades 
without delivery of energy commodities in multilateral markets. The 
FERC has said that it will investigate EnronOnline and other 
transactions by the company to determine if it was guilty of price-
gouging during California's power crisis last year. Western 
politicians have accused Enron of intentionally inflating wholesale 
power and natural gas prices during that period. Some allege that the 
potential for market abuse has not disappeared with Enron's demise. 
EnronOnline offered real-time markets for a number of commodities, 
including OTC contracts for crude oil, natural gas, power, and 
bandwidth. Enron was either as a buyer or seller in all transactions. 
According to testimony before Congress, some have said that the 
combination of market information and market power gave Enron the 
opportunity to create self-serving price volatility and that UBS 
Warburg will now hold the same capability. Others say it adds 
liquidity to the market. Enron's former trading business began 
operating on Monday as UBSWenergy.com. The Democratic legislation may 
rekindle a debate over whether any federal oversight is necessary in 
the derivatives market. The former head of the CFTC proposed such 
regulatory oversight a couple of years ago, but the plan was rejected 
after pointed criticism from industries and Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan. The current head has told the House panel that the 
CFTC does not need additional regulatory authority because Enron's 
positions in the futures market were smoothly closed out after its 
bankruptcy.

Centennial Pipeline Scheduled to Open April 1st
  
    The opening of the Centennial Pipeline, scheduled for April 1st, 
may help solve wild regional price swings for gasoline and diesel 
fuel that have affected the Midwest in recent years. The pipeline 
will begin taking shipments March 1st for up to 200,000 bpd of 
refined oil in batches of at least 25,000 barrels from Texas and 
Louisiana to Illinois. Over the last 2 summers pump prices in the 
Midwest have spiked over $2 per gallon because of supply shortages. 
The price spikes usually happen after refinery outages or pipeline 
problems in the region, which relies heavily on imports from the Gulf 
Coast to meet summer demand. The Centennial line is owned equally by 
Marathon Ashland Petroleum, PEPL, and TEPPCO. The pipeline originates 
in Beaumont, TX with a new 24-inch diameter, 74-mile TEPPCO line to 
Longville, LA. From there it will use a 26-inch, 720-mile converted 
natural gas pipeline and ends in Bourbon, IL. Centennials only 
terminal is in Creal Springs, IL. The Centennial Pipeline is expected 
to relieve product price swings mainly in Chicago. While, the 
pipeline will not deliver products directly to the Group Three hub, 
but will free up crude from the Gulf to head there, alleviating some 
of that hub's instability. The Centennial can expand its capacity to 
320,000 bpd, but no date for expansion has been set.  About 2 million 
barrels of product will be required to fill the pipeline. The 
Centennial will tie into the TEPPCO system at Creal Springs and the 
Marathon Ashland pipeline system at Creal Springs and Martinsville, 
in east-central Illinois. The largest pipeline running to the Midwest 
from the Gulf Coast is the 500,000 bpd Explorer Pipeline, which 
supplies both the Group 3 and Chicago Midwestern hubs.

Kim-

As I had mentioned, I'd like to find a time we could meet with your group to discuss Marketing's 2002 needs, wants, priorities, etc..  I just want to be sure that Planning doesn't waste any of the next few months going in a direction opposite to the commercial group.

I would plan on having Dennis, Mansoor, Perry and Ron attend, and could have Optimization represented as well if you'd like.  Obviously I'll be there, and Keller will come if he can.

Let me know what you think.  I'll be in Omaha next Mon-Wed, but am available other than that.

Thanks,

Morgan

Crude Oil Futures Dip as Inventories Rise

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.50 to 
$19.08 per barrel yesterday after weekly inventory reports said that 
inventories were continuing to grow, in spite of an output cut by 
major oil producing countries. While the API said crude supplies 
increased by 27,000 barrels, the API reported a much steeper 2.1 
million barrel rise. The API said that gasoline inventories climbed 
by 2.74 million barrels and EIA data indicated a 2.6 million barrel 
increase. But the implied demand for gasoline remained unchanged. 
Distillate stocks fell by 200,000 barrels according to the EIA and by 
150,000 barrels in API data. Implied demand for distillates dropped 
from 4.12 million barrels to 3.85 million barrels last week. The API 
said that refinery usage dropped to 85.8% from 89.4%, while the EIA 
pegged it at 86.8%. Traders are still watching OPEC and non-cartel 
producers who committed to cut almost 2 million bpd from supplies on 
January 1st. It may take a few more weeks before the reductions have 
an impact in the US and there have been conflicting reports of 
compliance by the producers. Heating oil futures for February 
delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.0114 to $0.5091 per gallon. February 
gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0138 to $0.5531 per gallon. In 
London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the IPE were 
down $0.45 to $18.79 per barrel.

President Pushes for ANWR Drilling in State of Union Speech
  
    In the annual State of the Union address, President Bush called 
for immediate passage of a National Energy Plan that would create 
jobs for hundreds of thousands of unemployed Americans and decrease 
dependence on foreign oil. The President's comments were directed at 
the Senate where energy legislation is currently stalled. During one-
half of the  speech, the President spoke to economic issues facing 
the country and made specific inference that developing domestic 
resources for energy was a matter of both national security and 
economic recovery. Supporters of opening the coastal plain of the 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge say that the President's remarks are 
indicate that safe and responsible ANWR development could double the 
current domestic supply of oil and help stimulate the economy through 
job creation. The president made a strong statement in a bipartisan 
fashion that included support for domestic energy. The presence of  
president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which 
supports the president's ANWR efforts, illustrated the importance 
President Bush places on ANWR and jobs. The president enhanced 
bipartisan support by demanding environmental protection. No areas in 
the US are equal to ANWR in their oil potential and environmental 
safeguards. The US Geological Survey reports that beneath the 1.5 
million-acre tract in Alaska's Coastal Plain is upwards of 16 billion 
barrels of recoverable oil. The 2,000 acres of the ANWR designated 
for exploration could replace Iraqi imports for the next 70 years, 
create hundreds of thousands of jobs nationwide and help promote 
national security.

Phillips and Conoco Merger Could Be Blocked

    Phillips and Conoco could face an unwelcome hurdle in their 
planned $26.2 billion merger in the form of a competing bid from 
ChevronTexaco and/or others. The deal could be susceptible to 
intervention because Conoco shareholders would get little or no 
premium. Conoco investors will get 0.4677 of a share in the new 
company for each of their shares. Phillips investors will receive a 
one-on-one swap. A competing offer could lead to a bidding war, since 
oil and natural gas prices are depressed. It seems that Conoco could 
be an easier target for ChevronTexaco because a bid for Phillips 
large refining interests on the West Coast may raise antitrust 
concerns. Shell, which has been seeking to expand their natural gas 
assets in North America could also be interested in Conoco. Conoco 
increased its natural gas reserves and production by 50% through its 
acquisition of Gulf Canada Resources last July. But, acquisition of 
Phillips could be more attractive to TotalFinaElf and would present 
no antitrust difficulties because it has no oil refinery operations 
in the US. However, competing bidders could find themselves put off 
by a poison pill buried in the Phillips/Conoco deal. The companies 
included a $550 million breakup fee if either company terminates the 
deal. However, that can be overcome if both are bought. Also, 
Phillips and Conoco tied up the industry's top 6 advisers, reducing 
the number of potential advisers available to other bidders and 
providing themselves with some high powered ammunition to fight a 
hostile bid.

World Heating Fuel Outlook


    Bitterly cold weather in the eastern half of Canada and the 
western half of the US over the next week will result in a 
substantial boost to heating fuel usage. Mild weather will persist 
throughout much of Europe and China's weather will be cold over the 
next week or so. A big increase in the heating fuel demand will 
continue to be seen through the week across the western portions of 
the US as a cold air mass from Canada moves southeastward. The 
eastern part of the nation will see warmer than usual weather causing 
the heating demand to remain lower than normal. Canada's coldest air 
mass of the season will shift from the western provinces into Ontario 
and Quebec this week. The demand for heating oil will jump as the 
frigid temperatures replace mild weather in the east. Chilly 
temperatures will continue in the west maintaining steady heating 
demand usage, but warmer weather is expected for northern British 
Columbia and Alberta. In Europe, temperatures 5? - 9? above normal 
continue through next week resulting in below normal heating fuel 
demand across much of the continent. The warmer temperatures will 
shift into the far eastern countries of the region allowing near-
normal temperatures to return to the western countries by the end of 
next week. In China, wintry weather will continue to track across 
much of the country as relatively cold temperatures persist in the 
west central regions of the continent, boosting heating fuel 
consumption. Japanese temperatures are expected to average 2? - 4 ? 
degrees below normal during the next 10 days with heating fuel 
consumption expected to be slightly above normal.

Investors Wary of Petro-Canada's Veba Deal 


    Investors gave Petro-Canada's $2 billion acquisition of Veba Oil 
& Gas' energy assets a tough reception yesterdayday, driving the 
stock price down to a 6-month low on concerns about rising debt as 
oil prices drop. Petro-Canada aims to vastly expand its international 
exploration and production profile by buying the assets of Germany's 
Veba from BP. The assets are located in the North Sea, North Africa 
and South America. The cash deal will boost Petro-Canada's reserves 
and production by more than 70% and add to earnings and cash flow per 
share. But it will also increase debt to 2.1 times last year's cash 
flow. Weakening commodity prices mean cash flow this year could be 
lower, exasperating the problem. Shares in Petro-Canada sank C$1.58, 
or more than 4%, to C$35.30 yesterday. Veba's assets are located in a 
dozen countries.

Iran's Petroleum Minister Says Cut Unnecessary

    Iran sees no reason for OPEC to cut oil production at its meeting 
in March, according to its petroleum minister. His comments came as 
OPEC's general secretary forecast that oil producing nations would 
again begin cooperating on pricing. Several OPEC members were Athens 
attending an energy sector conference. Russia says it will apply the 
same criteria it used when it last decided to cut oil production, 
including an appraisal of the international oil situation. Russia 
disappointed OPEC last year when asked it to cut output to keep up 
prices. Russia initially offered a cut of just 30,000 bpd, and only 
after intensive lobbying by OPEC officials offered to increase its 
cut to 150,000 bpd. OPEC says the economic fallout from the September 
11th attacks would only have short to medium term effect on oil 
prices. It forecasts world oil demand reaching around 106 million bpd 
by 2020 compared with 76 million bpd now. By 2020, OPEC says it will 
be producing 53 million bpd, or a market share of about 50%.

No bullets just an FYI for you.

El Paso Field Services called this week to inquire whether TW?Enron would consider selling off any of its assets.  I spoke with Gina Tylor about who to refer this question to and she said Eric's group.  Kevin and I called EPFS back and they are interested specifically in buying the Atoka and Crawford laterals.  While such a sale of assests would have a big impact on TW, it's alittle too early to tell if EPFS is serious.  I'll keep you posted.

Date:  Friday, March 1, 2002

Hi everybody.  It's Steve Cooper.  It's Friday afternoon, March 1.  I hope everybody has had a great week.  I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop.

The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion.  I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues.  Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable.  I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues.

In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund.  We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees.  I wanted you to be aware of that.  I really do appreciate and understand everybody's upset.

Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors' Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program.  As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification.

The Creditors' Committee formed a subcommittee.  We provided to them more data.  Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28.  We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors' Committee on this program.

I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff's and my highest priority.  It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed.  I told the creditors' subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court.  I'll keep you posted on progress.  I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs.  Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail.

The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions.  Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week.  Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases.  And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process.  So hopefully, we'll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases.

We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract.  It is a shame we won't be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate.  I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees' fund.  I'd like your input on that.  I thought it was a great idea and very generous.

We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month.  Hopefully I'll be able to meet many of you there.  I've tried to get around to say hello here and there.  And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz.  Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I'm making a very concerted effort to answer everybody's inquiries.

Other than that I don't have a lot to report.  We'll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program.  Hopefully by next Friday I'll be able to report very substantial progress in this area.  I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward.

One other thing ?

We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon.  We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here.  We'll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting.  I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron's future.  I'll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting.

Anyway, as I was saying ? 

Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication.  I hope you have a great weekend.  I'll chat with next week.

Herb,

I wanted to follow up to determine if the revised payment instructions for the December 31st wire of $ 1.6M had been sent.

Thanks.

BP executed the firm deal Blanco - Needles, Cal. '03 and '04 at the $0.26 plus fuel rate.

NGPL has notified TW that The NGPL/Eddy point is in service to flow both IT and FT.

Red Rock - System Ops and Planning have determined that if Red Rock capacity is staged in, Sta. 1/2 in-service 6/1 and Sta. 3 late, the capacity available is 70,000/d which indicates we would have to allocate into the contracted amount that should begin 6/1.  Should we think about setting aside the 1,700/d for Oneok's contract so they don't get allocated?

NGPL OBA - Updated Steve this am after his conversation with Deb.  Bill Rapp is confirming what rights NGPL has in its tariff and then he, Steve and I will discuss prior to Bill and I meeting with NGPL.

Cirque du Soleil - Dynegy (Phil Richardson) and BP (Russell and Penny) have agreed to join us on the 24th.

Duke - I continue to work with DETM/DFS on netting the imbalances and with DFS about the reconciliation of the Mobil/Pyote fuel situation.

No problem; its 1927 Woodbury St.,77030.  (Woodbury comes from the address
of the house that was torn down to build several townhouses on that lot.)

This is so embarrassing...is your address 1924 Holcombe Blvd., or 1924
Staffordshire?  And I'm assuming your zip is 77030, right?

Thanks (head hung low),

Subject:	Discounting of GRI on One-part Contracts
Importance:	High

It again appears that some one-part contracts have not had the GRI commodity portion discounted to zero whenever possible.  This detail needs to be reviewed monthly since it  impacts Transwestern's bottom line.  Can we discuss so that everyone is on the same page?  Maybe we need a point person in the scheduling group to review a monthly report and identify who within Marketing will be updating/correcting the rates in CBS.

Examples of discounted contracts in January 2002 where we paid out to the GRI rather than discounting to zero and taking the money to income:
Sempra K #27808
PG&E Energy Trading K #27796
Western Gas K #27797
Agave K #27377
Tenaska K #27792


Please let me know what your thoughts are.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

I am attaching a profile of the efficiencies between Bloomfield and Bisti for Feb 22-
March 11.

 
Summary
1)	Before pigging, (i.e. 21-27th), the efficiency was about 96.5%
2)	After the pig run on the 27th, the efficiency increased to about 102% for two days.
3)	It averaged about 101% for the next 6 days (i.e. 28th-5th March).  
4)	It then steadily plummeted to 98% over a 3-day period - a percent degradation a day! (5th-8th March)
5)	It remains around the 98% average today.

Essentially, the high efficiency resulting from the 27th Feb pigging lasted just about a week.
The targeted efficiency for this section is 103%.

At the TW commercial meeting this afternoon, we indicated that applying the DRA around the end of May (together with other planned outages) may be the way to go. Meanwhile,  I believe we should schedule another pig run as soon as we can. 
I did also receive the sample collected from the last pig run. I will have it analyzed and report on our findings.

Please let me know any thoughts you may have on this issue

We kicked a pig down the San Juan Lat. on 2-27-02 @ 08:03 MST Pressure was 1145 PSI, Flow of 840.  It was a newly rebuild pig and was kicked dry.   Bisti was down for 55 min, and the pig went by Bisti @ 10:26 MST.  Data at each valve site retreved off RTUs.   If you have any questions or comments, please call.

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Mar. 14
Beginning today through 3/19, the Corporate Security team will replace the GRC.dat file in W:\scripts\UpdateGRC and W:\scripts\logon\Win2000\original to point NAV clients on nahou-apnav01 to nahou-apnav02 (only about 650 left).  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
>From 11:00 - 11:15 a.m., the Corporate Security group will remove the svceu_SAPConnect account from CORP Domain Admins group.  No impact is expected.

Mar. 15
>From 4:00 - 6:00 p.m.., the Unix Team will upgrade the Time server.  Timex.ect.enron.com which is now on a Unix desktop network will be moved to a production network and to Netra T1 hardware. It would be doing the same activity as Rolex which was replaced on Monday. All clients are now pointing to new Rolex server & Timex.  No impact is expected.  

Mar. 15
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will replace the switch on the Extranet link HOPIX1.  This change will cause intermittent outages for those external companies using this link to access the Enron Network.

Mar. 15
>From 8:00 p.m. through 3/17 at 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will re-enable the File Replication Service on all Corporate domain controllers.  This change is necessary to replicate security policies.   FRS will be started on Corp DCs one at a time, watching to be sure replication completes.  Brief outages of Corp.enron.com security policies and possibly Exchange may occur.  The Messaging team will be notified if replication causes problems.  Support staff whose applications experience problems due to FRS should contact the solution center at ext. 54745.
Mar. 15
>From 10:30 - 11:30 p.m., the Corporate Server team will place Nahou-appr1 into the Corp Domain.  This change will affect applications using the R drive. 
Mar. 16
>From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Telephony Services will perform the monthly maintenance on the CMS (Call management) systems.  This maintenance affects only call center reporting.  No impact to users is expected.
Mar. 16
>From 2:00 - 4:00 p.m., the Blackberry Network Team will perform maintenance on a component of the Blackberry Network.  Some customers may experience delays in receiving messages.  It is also possible that messages sent from he Blackberry may be returned.  Returned messages can be resent after the maintenance is complete.
Mar. 18
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will change the DHCP scopes to update the secondary WINS and DNS entries.  This change will affect workstations that get their IP addresses via DHCP.  All scopes are renewed on a 24-hour basis so all changes should be completed by 3/19.  No impact is expected.
May 1
At 5:00 p.m., the Corporate Security team will remove access to CORPHOU-DC07 (172.23.226.23, primary/secondary DNS) and NAHOU-NSWN03 (172.23.226.24, primary/secondary WINS) from devices within ECN.   All servers/workstations/equipment using these for WINS/DNS must have their settings changed. Use 172.16.7.120 for DNS and 172.16.7.116 for WINS in their place by this 5/01.

Attached are the shippers who have not paid their Jan transportation invoices.


MS reps
Call your shippers ASAP and provide an explanation as to why they are paying late.  There seems to be a few shippers who always pay late - North Star Steele, CMS, KN.  If you feel that we need a marketer to get involved with your late payers, please contact them.


thanks

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Stan................just a reminder to follow up with the commercial group regarding the question about gas going off the system.  While we have capacity, the field doesn't see much happening to bring customers back or to get new customers.  There was also the issue of better communication between the commercial group and the field.  They specifically mentioned a situation with ONEOK.  The customer told the field employees that ETS was releasing gas to them, not our commercial group.

Again...............you did an outstanding job yesterday.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================
PREVIEW for March 10, 2002
======================================================

Dear Folks -

   A tradition in our marriage is taking some time off and away when one of
us has a birthday. Sherry's is coming up and we're going to go celebrate.
I've asked one of the most popular guest speakers to return to spend time
with you.

   Marsha Davis-Riley has spoken often to Ordinary Life and always with good
response. This Sunday the title of his presentation is:

                       "Homecoming"

   This is what she has to say about her topic:

   "No matter how high the stakes, it is tempting to remain in a limited
life role, languishing in its safety, borne of  familiar patterns and
rituals. The freedom to improvise rarely occurs to us. It just happens one
day on our way home."

   I'm not sure exactly how she will amplify on that but it sounds very
compatible with what we've been talking about. Certainly it sounds as if it
fits "Journey into Wholeness."

   I'll see you on the 17th to talk about SIN.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

PS ? Up for bringing refreshments this week are:
Jim and Jeanne Smith &
Denise Salet
======================================================

Ordinary Life is a gathering that provides an opportunity to develop an
enlightened heart and an awakened mind to the reality of the present moment..

Crude Oil Futures Slide Lower


    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.68 to 
$20.73 per barrel yesterday as traders waited for the latest weekly 
inventory data. Many expect the API to show that oil inventories grew 
by at least 1.5 million barrels last week. However, supplies of 
gasoline are expected to show a small decrease because of production 
cuts by refineries. Heating oil inventories were also expected to 
drop as many expected that winter weather last week boosted demand. 
Fears that government-procured additions to the SPR could lower short 
term supplies fueled a big jump in crude prices on Monday, but appear 
to have lessened. Concerns that OPEC and non-member producers will 
not abide by their production cuts offered little support to the 
market. According to Platt's, OPEC is moving closer to compliance 
with their quotas. Platt's said that January production by the 
cartel, excluding Iraq, was still more than 1 million bpd over their 
limits, but 640,000 bpd below Decembers exports. Heating oil futures 
for March delivery on the NYMEX fell $0.0159 to $0.546 per gallon. 
March gasoline futures on the NYMEX slid $0.0181 to $0.6019 per 
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for March delivery on the 
IPE were down $0.98 to $20.46 per barrel.

S&P Places PDVSA on CreditWatch 

    S&P has placed the senior unsecured notes of PDVSA Finance, a 
subsidiary of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, on CreditWatch with 
negative implications, after placing the credit rating of Venezuelas 
currency, the sovereign, on CreditWatch with negative implications. 
The CreditWatch affects $3.6 billion of US dollar-denominated notes 
and 200 million in euro-denominated notes. The rating on the PDVSA 
Finance notes will depend on S&P's assessment of changes in the level 
of sovereign risk and the extent to which the structure mitigates 
such sovereign risk. While a downgrade of the sovereign would not 
trigger an automatic downgrade of PDVSA Finance, the level of 
political control and influence of the government on PDVSA makes such 
an action likely. On a separate note, the recent news regarding the 
breach of contract brought claim against PDVSA by its joint venture 
partner, Lyondell Chemical, also underscores the sovereign risk 
inherent in public sector cross border future flow transactions. S&P 
is reviewing PDVSA's claim that the lawsuit will not have a have a 
material effect on it. While the lawsuit was not the reason for the 
CreditWatch placement, when reviewing sovereign risk for a structured 
transaction supported by government-owned assets, S&P takes into 
consideration the public sector entity's unwillingness or inability 
to abide by its agreements or contracts because of shareholder 
pressure. This is true for PDVSA Finance, since as of December 31, 
2001, up to 29% of the exports supporting PDVSA Finance's debt were 
sold to wholly owned subsidiary, CITGO Petroleum and a further 32% 
were sold to joint venture partners. S&P believes that during a 
sovereign stress scenario there is a greater likelihood that PDVSA 
would violate its agreements and redirect export revenues from CITGO, 
and to a lesser degree, its joint venture partners, than from 
nonaffiliated companies. Also, S&P has been notified by PDVSA that it 
is planning to cut production in March 2002, which could reduce crude 
oil deliveries to its joint venture partners and other customers by 
as much as 20%. While the cuts are expected to lead to lower debt 
service coverage levels, the extent of any reduction in coverage 
levels will depend on the effect the cuts have on future oil prices. 
S&P will continue to monitor coverage levels, which although 
declining, continue to be strong, with the ratio of exports revenues 
to debt service at a very comfortable 19 times in January 2002.

Shell Says Enron Vindicates Management Style

    The Enron crisis has changed the way analysts view Royal 
Dutch/Shell, silencing critics who once dismissed the it as an 
anachronism in an era of fast-paced energy traders, according to 
Shell Chairman Phil Watts at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates 
conference. Two or three years ago there was a fad and a fashion 
about and we were being criticized for being a bit too conservative, 
a bit too slow, a bit too capital-intensive, he said. Watts rejects 
the suggestion that Shell's large cash resources need to be spent. 
However, he says that the company has made it absolutely clear that 
acquisitions, divestments, mergers as well as organic growth are all 
part of the number of opportunities that we can take to grow value in 
the company. Watts described Shell as a believer in oil industry 
consolidation.

BP 4th Quarter Earnings Dip 62% 


    BP has reported that 4th quarter earnings fell 62% to $1.06 
billion, or $0.05 per share, from $2.8 billion, or $0.12 per share a 
year ago due to a decline in energy prices. However, it also says 
that its oil and natural gas production grew by 5.5% last year, more 
than double that of Royal Dutch/Shell, which had a 2% increase. 
ExxonMobil's production was up by 1%, which does not include problems 
in Indonesia because of political turmoil. BP said it has about $5.8 
billion in off the books debt, in addition to $21 billion of debt on 
its books and that the items are included in BP's annual report. BP 
contends that the off the balance sheet debt is transparent and as 
such very different from special purpose vehicles. BP said it found 
almost twice the amount of oil it produced in 2001 through the 
discovery of new fields and improved recovery rates at existing 
sites. Shells new reserves were only about 74% of its 2001 
production. Despite the higher production, profits from oil and 
natural gas production were cut in half to $2.37 billion. BP received 
an average $17.72 per barrel for its oil, 37% below a year ago, and 
$2.28 per Mcf of natural gas, a drop of 39%. This year, BP is aiming 
at $1.4 billion in performance improvements, with $600 million of 
that total to come from the chemicals unit due to higher sales and a 
9% cut in costs. Excluding one-time charges, the chemicals unit lost 
$67 million. BP plans to cut costs at the unit by $250 million this 
year, partially through job elimination. It will also reduce spending 
to $800 million from $1.2 billion last year at the unit. BP expects 
to invest $12-$13 billion this year, lower than last years $13.2 
billion, excluding acquisitions. More cutbacks are in store for the 
oil and natural gas exploration unit, where BP has already cut 120 
job in Alaska and 70 in Canada. Revenue in the 4th quarter fell by 
21% to $42 billion. BP raised its quarterly dividend by $0.0575 per 
share, up 10% from a year earlier.

Mad Dog Field Receives Approval

   BP says development of the Mad Dog oil field in the Gulf of Mexico 
has received approval. BP owns 60.5% of the field. BHP Billiton owns 
23.9% and  Unocal owns 15.6%. Development of the field would help BHP 
Billiton, Australia's biggest oil company, towards its goal of 
increasing oil production by 38% by 2006. Last November it sais it 
would spend $300 million on Mad Dog. An appraisal well has indicated 
Mad Dog may contain as much as 450 million barrels of oil.

Kim, The attached reflects NNG Marketing's allocation %'s for capital and allocations to TW.  The only thing I know of that will change is the Pricing desk.  Jo has ask me to get with you and Sean/Richard to determine what a fair allocation would be.  I am out for the rest of the year after today.  Can we review and determine any changes after the 1st?  I also had a summary of the kinds of things each of the teams were doing for TW but I can't seem to get my hands on it right now.  I'll look some more and maybe I'll have it for our discussion.

    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX, driven by a fund buying rally, jumped well above key resistance levels and settled up $0.191 at $2.397 per MMBtu. The April contract gained $0.17 to $2.427 per MMBtu. The market opened up at $2.28 and continued to run higher as fund buying hit buy-stops for March at $2.345, jumped up to $2.38 and bounced between $2.38-$2.40 until the close. Look for the market to continue higher this morning ahead of the AGA storage report, perhaps into the $2.50s. A new bullish, below-normal weather forecast for next week was enough to trigger the additional fund buying. Expectations are for a withdrawal of about 110  120 Bcf. A year ago, the AGA reported a 81 Bcf draw. Estimated volume yesterday was about 111,000 contracts, with 45,000 of those spreads. The market continues to carry a very high $0.92 forward difference between March and January 2003. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally  $0.05  $0.!

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
JP Morgan Chase was sued by shareholders who accuse the bank of failing to disclose the amount of money at stake because of exposure to Enron. A law firm has filed a class action suit on behalf of shareholders who purchased JP Morgan Chase shares between November 28th and January 28th. Shares of JP Morgan Chase fell 8.5% during that time. The suit alleges that the bank was reckless when it issued a public statement on November 28th that did not fully disclose its exposure to Enron. JP Morgan Chase listed its total exposure to Enron at $900 million, then raised it to $2.6 billion, the attorneys said. JP Morgan Chase says that the action is without merit. It has been reported that the SEC is looking at JP Morgan Chase's disclosures about Enron exposure, and whether they were stated in a timely manner. JP Morgan Chases CEO has said that the bank assumed too many risks in dealings with Enron. It wrote off $456 million of trading losses and loans to Enron in the 4th quarter and h!
as exposure to potential losses of $2.06 billion. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    In a move to boost its balance sheet, El Paso Corp plans to sell 10,677 miles of natural gas pipelines and gathering systems in Texas, and its share of a natural gas plant in New Mexico for $750 million to its partner El Paso Energy Partners. El Paso Energy will pay $560 million in cash and transfer $190 million in assets to El Paso Corp, including a production platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The transaction is expected to close this quarter. El Paso Corp announced plans to sell $2.25 billion in assets after Moody's warned that it must reduce debt or face credit downgrades. Moodys has moved El Paso Energy Partners credit outlook from positive to stable. El Paso Energy Partners plan to pay for the deal by borrowing money and issuing shares will raise its debt by more than 50%, Moodys said. El Paso Energy Partners said the acquisition will raise its dividend this year by $0.10 per share to $2.60, the 4th increase in the past year. Including these purchases, El Paso Energy !
Partners has said it plans to spend about $1 billion this year on capital projects. El Paso Energy Partners plans to build and operate the 380-mile Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System in the Gulf of Mexico and is looking for partners for up to a 50% share in the $450 million project. El Paso Corp owns 27% of El Paso Energy Partners, which was formed in 1998 to allow investors to buy shares in its natural gas storage, gathering and transportation businesses. El Paso has sold $416 million in pipelines and plants to El Paso Energy in the past year, not including their most recent deal. Late last year, El Paso said it would move $2 billion in debt held by affiliated partnerships onto its balance sheet and sell as much as $860 million in stock to reassure investors. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>  <BR>
    AES, whose stock price plunged by 50% in just the last 2 sessions, has said it would sell assets to raise between $1-$1.5 billion, including some merchant and trading operations in New York, California and the UK. Shares of AES closed at $4.75, down $2.25, or over 32% yesterday. AES shares closed at $9.50 on Thursday. AES said that maintaining its cash flow cushion is the most significant priority at the moment. It also said it would reduce its exposure to Latin American markets. AES plans to sell Illinois utility Cilcorp; a minority stake in the Ipalco utility in Indiana; interests in Itabo, a coal-fired power plant in the Dominican Republic; and other unspecified AES plants. Fitch has downgraded AES debt and convertible securities because of tight liquidity, and put its debt on a negative outlook. S&P has put AES on credit watch with negative implications. There are questions about how much AES assets will fetch in a market already inundated with assets of other power !
producers attempting to shore up their balance sheets. Weak demand could also have an impact on sales. AES said it will cut capital spending by $490 million from a planned $1.2 billion, mostly from projects under construction. AES said it had $110 million cash on hand and another $155 million through a revolving loan credit, giving it a total liquidity of $265 million. AES, whose Venezuelan unit Electricidad de Caracas was expected to generate about 10% of the companys total cash flow this year, was hurt by the devaluation of the bolivar, which fell by more than 10% after Venezuela began allowing the currency to float last week. AES has also said that because of the recent drop in its stock price, margin calls in connection with personal loans have led 3 officers to sell shares. <BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    Enrons accounting problems were not due to aggressive use of mark-to-market techniques but rather were the result of a lack of consistent, clear financial disclosure, according to a Dynegy senior executive at the Edison Electric Institute International Financial Conference in London. Increased financial disclosure is the critical issue for the industry, not mark-to-market itself. Accrual accounting for energy trading contracts, which has been replaced by mark-to-market in most circumstances, provides more opportunities for fraud, manipulation and deception. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    A bill that would provide greater regulatory oversight of derivatives, including those traded on electronic platforms, is an overreaction to Enron's collapse and could create more problems than it solves, according to the National Energy Marketers Association. The energy marketers say that the markets have already identified and punished companies that have problems similar to Enron. The bill is sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. It would remove existing exemptions and put the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in charge of overseeing all energy derivative transactions conducted on multilateral markets and electronic trading platforms to ensure that such transactions are transparent. All bilateral transactions not regulated by the CFTC would fall under the FERCs jurisdiction. Also, the CFTC would ensure that entities running online trading forums maintain sufficient capital to carry out their operations and maintain open books and records for investig!
ation and enforcement purposes. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

Platts Study Says Data Center Power Problems Never Happened<BR>
</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    Two years ago, utilities feared a surge of new data center development would overwhelm the electric power supply, but those fears were never realized. Now, utilities are preparing for the next wave of development of these facilities that house computers used to process and store digital information for the Internet, according to the latest in a series of E Source reports from Platts. A series of studies titled, "Delivering Energy Services to Internet Hotels and Other High-Density Electronic Loads," explains why those anticipated electric loads never materialized. Many of the data centers that were planned for were never built. Those built and operating are running at low occupancy rates. Now, utilities are preparing for a future wave of data center development as the economy improves and demand for Internet-based services increase accordingly. The amount of power drawn by microprocessor chips continues to rise, and so the computers installed in future data centers may de!
mand much more power than those installed today. However, a future power crunch is unlikely as utilities are already preparing for the next wave of expansion. Utilities are instituting infrastructure charges that shift risk from the utility industry to the data center developers. They are also encouraging their data center customers to use new, more efficient electronic technologies that only recently came onto the market. <BR>

    The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator, PJM Interconnection and Southwest Power Pool plan to hold the 2nd meeting of the Single Market Design Forum from 10:00 AM  3:00 PM March 13th at the Hilton Greater Cincinnati Airport. To register, go to www.miso-pjm-spp.com - click Working Groups>Single Market Design Forum>Meeting Notices>March 13. Last month, MISO, PJM and SPP unveiled a vision to achieve a common single wholesale market with a one-stop shop that meets the needs of all stakeholders using the electric power grid in the areas served by them.  The organizations executed a Letter of Intent to develop a joint and common wholesale energy market for electricity producers and consumers in all or parts of 26 states, the District of Columbia and the Canadian province of Manitoba. To meet the needs of all market participants, the SMDF is using a consensus-based approach throughout the market-design process.  All interested parties are welcome to attend the SMDF!
 meetings, which are held regularly and facilitated by MISO, PJM and SPP staff. The goal of the SMDF is to identify the needs of market participants and promote efficiency in electricity markets.  </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#001020" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT>Market technicians are taking a close look at their charts to see if today's jump in prices will give way to bearish fundamentals.  "The earlier gap on the price charts should be a good reference point for price support," says John Beaver, President Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  Before today's trading a gap was left on the March daily bar chart by the trading that took place between January 18 and January 22, an extended holiday weekend. The low price for the March contract on January 18 was $2.21, but the high price on January 22, was $2.175 thus a 3.5 cent "gap" or area where no trading took place was left on the chart.  Today's trading also left a gap between the low, $2.27 and Friday's high of $2.21. The significance of the gaps is that typically buying demand is so great or selling pressure so heavy that the market will "gap" higher or lower with the next day's trading opening well above the previous day's high or substantially lower than the !
low of the day before.  "The gap on the (March) daily chart from 2.21 should be a good reference point for support. A gap was also left in today's trading. The area between $2.15 to $2.27 is good intermediate support. These gaps are significant in that they are holding," said Beaver.  Other traders aren't such strong believers.  "Gaps are almost always filled if for no other reason than markets go up and down. You wait long enough and they will be filled, the question is when," said a Houston trader.  "I look at them but they are overrated. Statistically they are extremely overrated, and traders put way too much emphasis on them but because people do that you have to pay attention to them," said a trader with Coquest, Dallas.  "Locals use more of an opening range than the gap, 'Let's say we've got a gap between $3.10 and $3.20. Are you buying 20's or 10's?  Where do you buy? Often the gap doesn't mean too much anyway'," he said.  "I look at them buy I wouldn't risk my reputa!
tion on them." Beaver is not deterred.  "I wouldn't mind seeing the AGA come out and push prices to $2.15 to $2.20 so i could buy some more. I think we could visit those support numbers very easily. If there were sell-offs, I would want to write some $2.00 put options. This last push down to $1.96 was a gift for writing out options," he declared.<BR>

Bert - I will be out of the office this Friday, 3/1.  In my absence, will you please check the 2 Duke contracts with the primary points East to East with alternate deliveries to CA at the incremental rates?  If there is any flow to CA, would you please work up the blended rate and make sure the invoice goes out correctly?  Thanks.

California:

Legislative - In an unprecedented bipartisan effort the Senate and Assembly both approved a bill making $2.2 billion in cuts in the current fiscal year state budget.  Additionally, these cuts, primarily in the areas of salaries to award teacher excellence and program expansions, will amount to $2.9 billion in cuts toward the upcoming fiscal year estimated deficit of $12 billion.

I99-07-003  SoCalGas Unbundling.  The Southern California Generation Coalition, The Utility Reform Network and the Department of General Services have filed a request for rehearing of the CPUC's decision to adopt the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement to unbundle the SoCalGas system.  No new issues were raised as the rehearing request reiterates their support for the Interim Settlement which didn't go as far to unbundle the system.

A01-09-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  The ALJ has issued the procedural schedule.  SoCal will file its revised application and testimony to reflect the impact of unbundling by March 4th.  Interested parties will file testimony on July 12th and Evidentary Hearings will begin August 27, 2002.

Call your shippers ASAP and provide an explanation as to why they are paying late.  There seems to be a few shippers who always pay late - North Star Steele, CMS, KN.  If you feel that we need a marketer to get involved with your late payers, please contact them.

The estimated throughput affected (at the pig speed of 5-7 mph) was about 600mmcfd. The run time was 18 hrs for the DRA.
But we will monitor the efficiencies for two weeks after the pigging before considering the DRA re-application. I suggest we probably prepare for that in case we have do it.
Thx

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.  

Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.

Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.  

As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Questions or concerns????

Subject:	RE: San Juan Lateral Eff.

Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD.

Folks -

The time of our next gathering is rapidly approaching.  On the evening 
of
Saturday, March 23, we will meet at Tom & Jerilynn Daugherty's home in
Pearland (time and directions will be forthcoming).  Kim Watson will be
making the menu assignments for our French-themed soiree.

We need to know who is planning to attend so that the assignments can be
properly made (and confirmed).  Please reply to this message by Tuesday,
March 5, at 5 p.m., or leave a message at my office at (281) 440-5300 
x222
with your plans to attend (or with your regrets).  If you can make it, 
tell
me who and how many you will be, and if you have any course preference 
for
your assignment.

Our last evening out at Mark's American was fantastic, and we are all
looking forward to returning to the in-home dining of our origins.  We 
hope
to see you there.

John

Natural Gas Futures Higher Despite Lower AGA 


    Natural gas futures for April delivery on the NYMEX continued 
higher yesterday, gaining $0.038 to $2.427 per MMBtu, despite a lower 
than expected AGA withdrawal. The May contract rose $0.03 to $2.479 
per MMBtu. The AGA reported only 64 Bcf was withdrawn from storage 
last week. However, as has been the case for the last several weeks, 
technicals have trumped storage data as the market driver. But the 
bearishness has been canned, to be drug out in a couple days as a 
reason for the market to fall. The fundamentals are known and the AGA 
doesn't really matter now because it does not materially affect the 
fundamentals on a short term basis. Storage inventories now stands at 
1.88 Tcf, compared with the 5-year average of 1.25 Tcf. Estimated 
volume was about 50,000 contracts, most of which were spreads. 
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was 
generally flat to plus or minus $0.05. Natural gas for next day 
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.48 per MMBtu.

 Canadian Naturals 4th Quarter Earnings Plunge

  
Canadian Natural Resources has reported that 4th quarter profit fell 
76% because of lower oil and natural gas prices and a C$19 million 
after tax loss on the sale of Gulf of Mexico properties it acquired 
in its takeover of Ranger Oil. Canadian Natural earned C$52 million, 
or C$0.43 per share, compared to C$223 million, or C$1.77 per share 
in the 4th quarter of 2000. Analysts' average estimate was C$0.65. 
Cash flow dropped 41% to C$328 million, or C$2.63 per share, from 
C$555 million, or C$4.39. Sales fell from C$838 million to C$578 
million. In the 4th quarter, Canadian Natural received an average of 
C$21.28 per barrel for its oil, down 16% from the year before. In 
December, it shut down some heavy crude production and delayed 
drilling until the spread between heavy and light oil prices 
narrowed. Its average natural gas price was C$2.94 per Mcf for the 
quarter, 60% lower than the previous year. Oil production averaged 
198,000 bpd, slightly below the 4th quarter of 2000. Natural gas 
production climbed 22% to over 1 Bcf per day partially due to 
drilling success at Ladyfern in northeastern British Columbia. 
Canadian Natural expects to produce 379,000 to 393,000 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day in 2002, up 7% from 2001. That would include 1.08 
to 1.1 Bcf of natural gas and up to 210,000 barrels of oil and gas 
liquids per day.

Analysts Testify Before Congress on Enron Rating Debacle


    Wall Street analysts, whose firms sold most of the $25 billion in 
stock and bonds issued by Enron, testified before Congress yesterday 
that they were not influenced by their companies dealings with Enron, 
and were misled about Enron's financial condition. As late as 
November 8th, 11 of the 16 analysts whose job it was to follow Enron 
still rated the company as `buy' or `strong buy'. Enron has been 
involved in 69 acquisitions, valued about $40 billion and held 62 
bond and note sales since 1985. Salomon Smith Barney was the biggest 
adviser on Enron mergers, with about $5 billion in transactions, 
followed by Credit Suisse with $4.45 billion. Credit Suisse served as 
the sole lead manager for $1.75 billion in secondary stock sales by 
Enron over the last 10 years, generating about $52.5 million in fees. 
Chase Manhattan arranged more than $7 billion in financing for Enron. 
Even though the analysts' may not have directly benefited from their 
stock recommendations, senators pointed to a potential conflict of 
interest because their firms' have business ties with companies the 
analysts follow. And, analysts can receive bonuses based on overall 
profits of their firms, which in turn can depend on the companies the 
analysts follow. The 4 analysts testifying at the hearing said they 
get bonuses on that basis. Some have proposed new regulations to 
increase barriers between investment bankers and analysts within a 
security firm. Analysts would have to disclose whether they 
personally hold any stock of a company they recommend and if their 
firm has business ties to that company. The analysts that testified 
yesterday represent Credit Suisse, JP Morgan Chase, Lehman and 
Citigroups Salomon Smith Barney.

FERC Approves Duke Purchase of Westcoast


    The FERC has approved Duke Energy's $8.5 billion acquisition of 
Westcoast Energy. The action cleared the way for Duke to take over 
ownership of Engage America and a power generation project operated 
by Frederickson Power, both subsidiaries of Westcoast. The new 
company will have natural gas related assets, including about 18,900 
miles of transmission pipeline, 241 Bcf of natural gas storage, 
58,700 miles of gathering pipeline, 84 processing facilities and 
16,500 miles of distribution pipeline. The acquisition has already 
been approved by Canadian regulators but must still be reviewed by 
the Investment Canada board. The deal must also be approved by the 
FTC and the SEC, which is not expected to be a problem.

Platts Says Power Prices Down 85% Nationwide from Year Ago 

     Wholesale day-ahead power prices are down 85% from year-ago 
levels, according to Platts. The average of benchmark prices across 
the nation fell $121.75 to $22.01 per MWh from mid-February 2001. The 
national average slipped only $0.16 from January to February. The 
greatest year-on-year declines remain in the West, where the region's 
power crisis sent prices to record levels last year. However, prices 
east of the continental divide also saw a significant drop. Day-ahead 
prices for Mid-Columbia fell 95% from $452.89 per MWh in mid-February 
2001. In the last month, prices rose 6% to an average of $21.43 per 
MWh. At Palo Verde, the most active Western hub, day-ahead prices 
slipped 94% to $23.82 per MWh from $397.63 per MWh in mid-February 
2001. Palo Verde spot prices have gained $0.67 in the last month. 
Northern and Southern California spot prices were each down 94% year-
on-year from an average of $433.11 per MWh and $452 per MWh, 
respectively. NP15, which corresponds to the California ISO's 
congestion zone for the Northern portion of the state, saw prices 
rise 7% to $25.67 per MWh from January to February. Prices for SP15, 
which corresponds to the Southern portion of the state, climbed 7% to 
$25.66 per MWh during the month. Spot power prices in the Northeast 
and Mid-Atlantic states saw declines both year-on-year and month-on-
month. New England day-ahead prices fell 43% to $27.42 per MWh from 
$47.77 per MWh in mid-February 2001 when strong natural gas prices 
buoyed prices. PJM West saw prices drop 24% to $21.98 per MWh from 
$28.99 per MWh February 2001. Prices in PJM are down $1.54 from last 
month. Into Cinergy day-ahead prices fell 51% to $18.58 per MWh from 
$38.64 per MWh year-on-year. Prices have moved up $1.54 since last 
month. Price for delivery to ERCOT, the grid operator for Texas, were 
$18.47 per MWh in mid-February, a 58% drop from the same time last 
year. The day-ahead prices have climbed $1.07.

PRICES AT KEY LEVEL

Since late January, natural gas futures have made an impressive 
advance of over 30 cents under fundamental conditions that appear to 
be unsupportive of increasing prices. Although students of the laws 
of supply and demand would require a shift in production, 
consumption, or other economic variables to revise their assessments 
of natural gas prices, market technicians see the situation from the 
standpoint of only analyzing price behavior or variables derived from 
price movements.  "I look at a number of different tools, but there 
is a beautiful (down) trend-line (that projects lower prices)," says 
an Oklahoma City analyst.  "The big debate as prices move up is that 
although there are overlapping technical patterns, the current rise 
may be the fourth (wave higher) of a five wave pattern down and there 
is one more new price low coming. The counter to that argument is 
that if prices reach and hold above $2.50, prices will not make that 
final (fifth wave) down, and that there is a bigger rally coming. A 
close over $2.50 per MMBtu, not just a trade over $2.50 is one issue 
that we are studying carefully," he said.  Prices maybe at a pivotal 
point.  "It will be key to see how prices handle themselves in the 
mid $2.40's. There's a very good chance that prices will retreat to 
the low $2.20's  I am in a negative mode on this market. But if we 
close above the trend-line at $2.50 then I will take a neutral to 
positive stance on this market.

Why don't we try Farrago?  Kim and I love it and it has an outside 
patio for those warm Houston winters.  Farrago is at the corner of Gray 
and Bagby (or is it Brazos? whichever one runs one way to the south).  
Phone number is 713-523-6404. 

Why don't we meet there at noon or 1 p.m.?  Tell us what fits your

Kim - I forgot this one, please add it to my list:

New TW receipt point with NGPL in Eddy Cty., NM.  In service date week of 12/24/01.  Increment supply to TW of 60,500 MMBtu/d.





Kim - Apparently I can't add.  The revenues under the BP Red Rock deal are $20,805,000 which brings my total deal dollars to $45,016,762.00.

You probably could have predicted this given the fact that Calpine has
dropped plans for over $20B in capital projects.  This should help prop up
basis expectations for at least the near - long term.  Congratulations!

Jeff


Sonoran Pipeline scrapped
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine
said Friday they have dropped plans for a $1.7
billion, 1,160-mile gas pipeline from the San
Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to California.
"The Sonoran Pipeline was unable to secure
sufficient binding commitments to make a successful
project given market conditions," the
companies said in a statement said. "Both KMP
and Calpine will continue to evaluate other
opportunities to serve the growing California
market." But no firm plans were mentioned.
Plans for the Sonoran Pipeline were
announced last spring. Sponsors had called for a
750,000 Mcf/day system that could be expanded
with compression to up to 1 Bcf/day.

Folks -

The time of our next gathering is rapidly approaching.  On the evening of
Saturday, March 23, we will meet at Tom & Jerilynn Daugherty's home in
Pearland (time and directions will be forthcoming).  Kim Watson will be
making the menu assignments for our French-themed soiree.

We need to know who is planning to attend so that the assignments can be
properly made (and confirmed).  Please reply to this message by Tuesday,
March 5, at 5 p.m., or leave a message at my office at (281) 440-5300 x222
with your plans to attend (or with your regrets).  If you can make it, tell
me who and how many you will be, and if you have any course preference for
your assignment.

Our last evening out at Mark's American was fantastic, and we are all
looking forward to returning to the in-home dining of our origins.  We hope
to see you there.

John

2002 U.S. REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION STUDY

Dear Energy Industry Professional:

As the wholesale energy and transmission sectors 
continue their dramatic transformation, it's critical for 
energy professionals to understand the latest changes 
and how they will impact the electric industry.  For the 
last decade, ever-changing, complex issues have 
characterized the regional transmission organization 
(RTO) landscape.  This year's events are no exception.  
As FERC persists in its effort to drive RTO formation, its 
latest rulings have pushed for a U.S. transmission 
industry that is increasingly regional in shape, scope, 
and function.

order before February 22, 2002, you can purchase EFI's 
350+ page 2002 U.S. Regional Transmission 
Organization Study for the discounted price of $400 for

Praise for the Annual RTO Study
http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=zu6rqqn6.mnhgwqn6.sghbwqn6&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.efinc.com%2Fsecure%2Forderform_study.asp
This year's RTO study expands upon acclaimed studies 
by EFI from the past three years:  "As the variety of 
species and subspecies multiplies in the fecund world of 
electricity transmission, Boston think tank EFI has 
produced a field guide to the critters.  EFI's United 
States Regional Transmission Organization Study 
provides an extensive breakdown of many of the thorny 
technical issues presently bedeviling the industry."  - 
Electricity Daily

EFI's RTO study provides comprehensive research on 
over 20 U.S. RTO and Transco initiatives.  In addition 
to detailing market characteristics, development and 
planning, governance, operating structures, 
transmission pricing, congestion management, and 
power exchanges for each initiative, this year's study 
analyzes the regional consolidation efforts now 
underway in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, and 
West.  For more information or to order the RTO study 
visit www.efinc.com or me at (781) 273-
5700 ext. 246.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Ryan Chaytors

Okay, I know someone is working on assigning us "not completely affiliated"=
 employees between NNG and TW at this time but I wanted to give you a littl=
e feedback.  Is there any way I could return to TW Marketing (your group) l=
ike my position was originally set up?  I assume they have me pegged to rem=
ain in Gas Logistics for NNG but there are numerous items that need attenti=
on and urgency that I cannot properly perform while on this team (nothing a=
gainst these people, just a poor team design).  You have always given me th=
e tools and latitude to make things work and I believe I thrive under that =
type of management.  I realize no one knows what will happen to TW/Enron bu=
t I would be happy to take my chances with you.  It may be too late and ass=
ignments set but I just wanted you to know how I felt.  Working TW while re=
maining in Gas Logistics would be okay but it would still lack the sense of=
 urgency and importance that I came to expect while in Marketing.  Of cours=
e I'll do my best wherever assigned.

The following items were discussed in this weeks corporate change control...

Feb 27
>From 5:00 - 6:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will block all ICMP messages from all Internet routers.  These changes will be made on the Houston, Ardmore EIN, and Omaha Internet routers.  No impact is expected.

Feb. 27
>From 9:00 - 10:00 p.m., the Messaging team will upgrade Nahou-MSBES01P, Nahou-MSBES02P and Nahou-MSBES03P to SP2 and apply a hotfix.  This change will result in a five minute delay sending and receiving Blackberry messages.

Feb 28
>From 7:00 p.m. through 3/1 at 1:00 a.m., the Unix team will upgrade the ftp.enron.com server from existing Ultar2 to E450 as well as upgrade ftp to Proftp ver. 1.2. This maintenance will result in a total outage of the ftp.enron.com site.  The old sites moby.enron.com and sparky.enron.com will no longer exist after this change.  Support staff should ensure jobs going to the enron ftp server use ftp.enron.com.  Any questions about this maintenance, contact me at 713-853-3381 or 713-859-6676.

Mar. 6
At 12:00 p.m., the Gas Measurement team will decommission the MIPS server (IP address 192.168.175.62).  All users and processing should be pointing to PGAS as the MIPS system is not longer being updated. The MIPS server will be powered off at this time but the equipment will not be moved until later.

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Kim, Eric is borrowing Kevin Hyatt's TW Tariffs (small) binder.  He has asked me to try to get one for him.  Does someone supply those or do I just need to have it reproduced for him.

Crude Oil Futures Climb After Strike Threatened

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX climbed $0.40 
to $19.48 per barrel after a labor union threatened a strike at 6 US 
oil refineries. The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy 
Workers International union has notified major oil companies that it 
may order a strike as early as today, unless progress was made in 
contract negotiations involving almost 30,000 of its members. The 
March crude oil contract moved between $18.95 and $19.50, with gains 
of about $0.29 coming in after reports of the strike. The market 
continues to look for proof that production cuts from OPEC and non-
OPEC exporters will be effective. Heating oil and gasoline prices 
crept higher on a pre-expiry short-covering rally. Refinery run cuts 
and planned maintenance also helped to support product prices. 
Heating oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.0138 
to $0.5229 per gallon. March heating oil futures rose $0.0185 to 
$0.5316 per gallon. Gasoline futures for February delivery on the 
NYMEX increased $0.0061 to $0.5592 per gallon. March gasoline futures 
climbed $0.0128 to $0.5742 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil 
futures for March delivery on the IPE were up $0.39 to $19.18 per 
barrel.

Refinery Releases Chemicals Into Air Near San Francisco

     A chemical release at the ChevronTexaco refinery in Richmond, 
California sent toxins spewing into the air yesterday, causing county 
health officials to warn residents to remain indoors. The refinery is 
located in Richmond, about 10 miles from San Francisco. Chevron 
officials say the situation is now under control. The chemicals, 
hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, can cause a 
burning and irritating sensation to the eyes, nose, throat and 
airways upon exposure at certain levels, prompting officials to warn 
residents to stay indoors and keep their windows closed. Part of the 
plant is shutdown for maintenance, although some units are still 
operating.

Occidental Acquires 21% of Lyondell
  
    Occidental Petroleum will acquire 21% of Lyondell Chemicals and 
Lyondell is buying Occidental's 29.5% interest in a joint venture, 
Equistar Chemicals. Occidental will become Lyondell's largest 
stockholder and will assume 2 seats on the Lyondell board. The deal 
will boost Lyondell's stake in Equistar to 70.5%. Millennium 
Chemicals owns the remaining 29.5%. Occidentals initial equity 
investment in Lyondell includes a purchase of about 34 million new 
Series B Lyondell shares that can be converted into common shares 
after 3 years. Lyondell will use the proceeds of that sale to buy 
Occidental's portion of Equistar. Occidental gained the stake upon 
adding its petrochemical business to the venture in 1998. Lyondell 
said the transactions would conserve cash and provide for 
acceleration of its debt repayment program. The financial details of 
the transactions were not disclosed. Lyondell said that while the 
deals will be cash-flow neutral and will dilute its earnings 
initially, they will be accretive to cash flow and earnings as the 
cyclical chemical business improves. With the additional cash, 
Lyondell is looking to pay off its $5.6 billion purchase of Arco 
Chemical in 1998.

Noble Posts 22% Raise in 4th Quarter Profits

    Noble Drilling has reported a 22% increase in 4th quarter 
earnings, with profits of $63.5 million or $0.48 per share, up from 
$51.9 million or $0.38 per share a year earlier. The 4th quarter 
average estimate of analysts was $0.47 per share. It also had 
operating revenue of $272.8 million compared to $225.9 million a year 
ago. Nobles international rigs fetched an average of $62,088 per day 
in the last quarter, 38% above year ago levels. Its Gulf of Mexico 
rig utilization fell to 65% from 100% a year ago, but Noble received 
$44,900 per rig on average during the quarter, a 1% increase over a 
year earlier. In addition, Noble said it would change its 
jurisdiction of incorporation to the Cayman Islands from Delaware as 
part of a corporate restructuring. The company will form Noble Corp, 
a subsidiary of Noble Drilling and the holding company of all the 
companies in the Noble group. Due to its significant exposure to the 
international markets, Noble said the new structure will give it 
greater flexibility operationally and financially. Stockholders must 
approve the move at the annual meeting in April. Nobles shares closed 
at $31.97, up $1.17.

Union Threaten Strike at 6 US Refineries
  

   The Paper, Allied-Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers 
International union has notified major oil companies that it may 
order a strike as early as today, unless progress was made in 
contract negotiations involving almost 30,000 members. The union said 
it would strike at 6 refineries, 2 in Texas and 4 in California, 
owned by ExxonMobil, ChevronTexaco, BP and Phillips. Combined, the 
plants have a production capacity of 1.2 million bpd, or about 9% of 
the nations oil refinery output. The refinery workers have been 
instructed to proceed with an orderly shutdown if no agreement or 
contract extension was in place by midnight last night, when the 
current contract expires. It would be the 1st strike at any US 
refineries since 1980. The union says that both parties are far apart 
on major issues and that picketing was a likelihood unless an 
agreement could be reached. Shell is the lead company negotiating 
with PACE officials and said it hoped for an agreement before the 
deadline. The oil companies are expected to keep the refineries 
running if a strike occurs, but would not say if production might be 
reduced. In the event of a strike, managers at the companies will run 
the refineries. Phillips said it would continue operating its 
California refineries with non-union personnel. Shell has offered a 
pay raise of $0.60 per hour for the contracts 1st year and annual 
raises of 3% and 3.5% after that. Shell's offer also called for a 
$0.75 per hour differential for the evening shift and $1.25 per hour 
for overnight shifts, $0.25 above the current contract in both cases. 
The union is bargaining for a pay hike of $1.40 per hour in the 1st 
year of the contract and subsequent annual raises of 6%. The union is 
also seeking an evening shift differential of 5% of the top pay grade 
at the worker's plant and 10% for overnight shifts. If the sides 
reach agreement, unions and oil companies will likely use it as a 
benchmark for oil workers contracts around the nation. US oil workers 
average earnings are about $23 per hour, or about $48,000 per year, 
excluding overtime. Under the union's proposal the 1st year average 
of the contract would rise to $25.79 an hour.

EIA Says Refinery Run Cuts Build Crude Oil Stocks 

    Crude oil stocks built sharply last week as poor profit margins 
and ample supply of refined products forced refiners to slash runs, 
according to the EIA. The nation's refineries have slowed by 5.4% in 
the past two weeks, dropping to just 86.8% last week. Last week's 
refinery use figure is the lowest reported by the EIA since February 
2000. Crude stocks built 2.1 million barrels last week as big 
refiners reduced runs to battle weak demand and poor margins. 
Earlier, the API showed crude supplies of 32.2 million barrels, or 
11%, above last year. The EIA reported a 2.6 million barrel gasoline 
build, boosted by a 120,000 bpd increase in gasoline imports as 
supplies flowed in from Europe. Refinery run cuts are not decreasing 
gasoline supplies as much as other products, with gasoline production 
holding strong last week at 8.15 million bpd. Total US product demand 
is down 4.5% from a year ago, even though gasoline demand is 0.8% 
higher. Distillate fuel stocks dropped 200,000 barrels, a small fall 
at a time when winter heating demand normally draws down inventories 
rapidly. Mild temperatures in the Northeast meant that heating oil 
stocks actually rose 1.5 million barrels. Diesel fuel stocks fell 1.7 
million barrels.

Exxon Denies Baton Rouge Refinery Maintenance
  
    Exxon Mobil is not planning February maintenance on a crude 
distillation unit at its 488,000 bpd Baton Rouge refinery, correcting 
earlier reports to the contrary. Industry sources had said Exxon 
Mobil planned to shutdown a crude distillation unit at the plant 
today for 4 weeks. The plant has shut a portion of its 35,000 bpd 
alkylation unit for work, but that the work has little effect on the 
refinery's output.

John:
       I'm writing you from Lakeway, Austin, Tx where I am 'retreating' for
spring break!  Came up here to play, to play with my grandchildren --
Christina and Reid.  Jim will join me midweek -- he'll play too.  Only his
favorite play activity is clearing the fields at our country place -
Trestleview.  Does that sound like fun, or what?
       The assignment from Kim sounds great -- we'll see you all then.
Much love,
Hattie and Jim

Lindy,

Since Socal will not be confirming during the timely cycle, this gas will be incremental and the supplies may not get scheduled. Also,  I know Socal confirms the Needles point via EDI. Will they also confirm this Socal Topock point via EDI? If they do confirm via EDI, it would be good to have them work with Mary Draemer on a test EDI file. Will they give us a window like they do at Socal needles?

Today in TMS, we do have a Non Grid cycle that runs just prior to the gas day starting at 7:30 am. I know Socal does not confirm  this cycle today for Needles. Also, currently in production today Socal Needles point 10487 is set up as a passive point for confirmation. This Topock point would need to be set up with the same point status role for confirmation if they confirm this point via EDI. Socal will need to complete the Operator Choice request form that is posted on the TW web site.

Thanks Ramona

I'm asking Ramona a question - it would probably be good if I had her on the address list =)

Also, Terry & Shelley - any comments?  We were discussing this in a meeting Friday afternoon and after I incorporate all of our comments, we're going to run it past SoCal as well.  This change is pursuant to a conversation Steve had with Ladd Lorenz last week.

Here's a simple first draft.  I didn't know how much detail we should get into.

Ramona, am I using the correct terminology?  They are not going to confirm in Cycle 1.  They are just going to let us fill-in where El Paso filled-up all the capacity downstream.

 << File: SoCal-TopockScheduling.doc >> 

Let me know your comments.

Thanks!

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
<BR>
    Natural gas futures for April delivery on the NYMEX continued higher yesterday, gaining $0.038 to $2.427 per MMBtu, despite a lower than expected AGA withdrawal. The May contract rose $0.03 to $2.479 per MMBtu. The AGA reported only 64 Bcf was withdrawn from storage last week. However, as has been the case for the last several weeks, technicals have trumped storage data as the market driver. But the bearishness has been canned, to be drug out in a couple days as a reason for the market to fall. The fundamentals are known and the AGA doesnt really matter now because it does not materially affect the fundamentals on a short term basis. Storage inventories now stands at 1.88 Tcf, compared with the 5-year average of 1.25 Tcf. Estimated volume was about 50,000 contracts, most of which were spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or minus $0.05. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.48 per M!

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
  <BR>
Canadian Natural Resources has reported that 4th quarter profit fell 76% because of lower oil and natural gas prices and a C$19 million after tax loss on the sale of Gulf of Mexico properties it acquired in its takeover of Ranger Oil. Canadian Natural earned C$52 million, or C$0.43 per share, compared to C$223 million, or C$1.77 per share in the 4th quarter of 2000. Analysts average estimate was C$0.65. Cash flow dropped 41% to C$328 million, or C$2.63 per share, from C$555 million, or C$4.39. Sales fell from C$838 million to C$578 million. In the 4th quarter, Canadian Natural received an average of C$21.28 per barrel for its oil, down 16% from the year before. In December, it shut down some heavy crude production and delayed drilling until the spread between heavy and light oil prices narrowed. Its average natural gas price was C$2.94 per Mcf for the quarter, 60% lower than the previous year. Oil production averaged 198,000 bpd, slightly below the 4th quarter of 2000. Natur!
al gas production climbed 22% to over 1 Bcf per day partially due to drilling success at Ladyfern in northeastern British Columbia. Canadian Natural expects to produce 379,000 to 393,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2002, up 7% from 2001. That would include 1.08 to 1.1 Bcf of natural gas and up to 210,000 barrels of oil and gas liquids per day. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</B><BR>
</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    Wall Street analysts, whose firms sold most of the $25 billion in stock and bonds issued by Enron, testified before Congress yesterday that they were not influenced by their companies dealings with Enron, and were misled about Enron's financial condition. As late as November 8th, 11 of the 16 analysts whose job it was to follow Enron still rated the company as buy or strong buy. Enron has been involved in 69 acquisitions, valued about $40 billion and held 62 bond and note sales since 1985. Salomon Smith Barney was the biggest adviser on Enron mergers, with about $5 billion in transactions, followed by Credit Suisse with $4.45 billion. Credit Suisse served as the sole lead manager for $1.75 billion in secondary stock sales by Enron over the last 10 years, generating about $52.5 million in fees. Chase Manhattan arranged more than $7 billion in financing for Enron. Even though the analysts may not have directly benefited from their stock recommendations, senators pointed to!
 a potential conflict of interest because their firms have business ties with companies the analysts follow. And, analysts can receive bonuses based on overall profits of their firms, which in turn can depend on the companies the analysts follow. The 4 analysts testifying at the hearing said they get bonuses on that basis. Some have proposed new regulations to increase barriers between investment bankers and analysts within a security firm. Analysts would have to disclose whether they personally hold any stock of a company they recommend and if their firm has business ties to that company. The analysts that testified yesterday represent Credit Suisse, JP Morgan Chase, Lehman and Citigroups Salomon Smith Barney. <BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
    The FERC has approved Duke Energys $8.5 billion acquisition of Westcoast Energy. The action cleared the way for Duke to take over ownership of Engage America and a power generation project operated by Frederickson Power, both subsidiaries of Westcoast. The new company will have natural gas related assets, including about 18,900 miles of transmission pipeline, 241 Bcf of natural gas storage, 58,700 miles of gathering pipeline, 84 processing facilities and 16,500 miles of distribution pipeline. The acquisition has already been approved by Canadian regulators but must still be reviewed by the Investment Canada board. The deal must also be approved by the FTC and the SEC, which is not expected to be a problem. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#ffffff" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff" SIZE=2 PTSIZE=10 FAMILY="FIXED" FACE="Courier New" LANG="0"><BR>

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT></B><BR>
     Wholesale day-ahead power prices are down 85% from year-ago levels, according to Platts. The average of benchmark prices across the nation fell $121.75 to $22.01 per MWh from mid-February 2001. The national average slipped only $0.16 from January to February. The greatest year-on-year declines remain in the West, where the region's power crisis sent prices to record levels last year. However, prices east of the continental divide also saw a significant drop. Day-ahead prices for Mid-Columbia fell 95% from $452.89 per MWh in mid-February 2001. In the last month, prices rose 6% to an average of $21.43 per MWh. At Palo Verde, the most active Western hub, day-ahead prices slipped 94% to $23.82 per MWh from $397.63 per MWh in mid-February 2001. Palo Verde spot prices have gained $0.67 in the last month. Northern and Southern California spot prices were each down 94% year-on-year from an average of $433.11 per MWh and $452 per MWh, respectively. NP15, which corresponds to the!
 California ISOs congestion zone for the Northern portion of the state, saw prices rise 7% to $25.67 per MWh from January to February. Prices for SP15, which corresponds to the Southern portion of the state, climbed 7% to $25.66 per MWh during the month. Spot power prices in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states saw declines both year-on-year and month-on-month. New England day-ahead prices fell 43% to $27.42 per MWh from $47.77 per MWh in mid-February 2001 when strong natural gas prices buoyed prices. PJM West saw prices drop 24% to $21.98 per MWh from $28.99 per MWh February 2001. Prices in PJM are down $1.54 from last month. Into Cinergy day-ahead prices fell 51% to $18.58 per MWh from $38.64 per MWh year-on-year. Prices have moved up $1.54 since last month. Price for delivery to ERCOT, the grid operator for Texas, were $18.47 per MWh in mid-February, a 58% drop from the same time last year. The day-ahead prices have climbed $1.07. </FONT><FONT  COLOR="#000000" BACK="#fff!

</P><P ALIGN=LEFT><BR>
Since late January, natural gas futures have made an impressive advance of over 30 cents under fundamental conditions that appear to be unsupportive of increasing prices. Although students of the laws of supply and demand would require a shift in production, consumption, or other economic variables to revise their assessments of natural gas prices, market technicians see the situation from the standpoint of only analyzing price behavior or variables derived from price movements.  "I look at a number of different tools, but there is a beautiful (down) trend-line (that projects lower prices)," says an Oklahoma City analyst.  "The big debate as prices move up is that although there are overlapping technical patterns, the current rise may be the fourth (wave higher) of a five wave pattern down and there is one more new price low coming. The counter to that argument is that if prices reach and hold above $2.50, prices will not make that final (fifth wave) down, and that there is !
a bigger rally coming. A close over $2.50 per MMBtu, not just a trade over $2.50 is one issue that we are studying carefully," he said.  Prices maybe at a pivotal point.  "It will be key to see how prices handle themselves in the mid $2.40's. There's a very good chance that prices will retreat to the low $2.20's  I am in a negative mode on this market. But if we close above the trend-line at $2.50 then I will take a neutral to positive stance on this market. <BR>

To all

Amy Mulligan and I will discuss payment procedures and Debbie Moseley and I will discuss coding.
However, before a payment or coding changes or etc are done,  I would like to have someone preapprove payments that TW will be sending to ENA.

Importance:	High

Richard,

What process needs to be followed in order to request a payment to be made to ENA per the terms of the agreement negotiated with Marketing when capacity is released on their behalf?  Please let everyone in the distribution know so they can follow these same procedures for next month as well.

Additionally, do we code the marketing fee revenues to a different account from the transportation revenues and how?


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Subject:	FW: Transwestern Capacity Release - ENA/Burlington 
Importance:	High

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.  All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates.  

I have also been advised by Marketing that another posting may occur for January 2001 (partial month) but nothing has been finalized.  I will send an updated file if necessary.
  
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Signed agreement w Citizens covering our costs and providing indemnification for work we will do converting their system to  a pressure control system with flow over-ride capability.  They were experiencing vibration problems that threatened the gas flow to the Griffith plant.  The work is being performed on 2/1 and there should be no flow interruption.

Good to hear from you Kim.  First, I did get the check.. I've been out of the office for over two weeks so it will be cashed this week sometime. Sorry about that.   I had not heard anything about a suprise party for Rich in Houston but regardless, with Red Rock, annual outages etc...  it would probably be a difficult time for me.  If I can help with anything please give me a yell.  The next trip to Houston, will probably tie in with a family vacation to Tx. sometime in July.  

We are making arrangements to give Rich a retirement party in the field as well.  I was responsible for donations as you know (got to keep it quiet now but we are getting him a four wheeler).  Rick and Arnie are setting up the party which will probably be on April 13 and most likely in Belen, Nm.  

Again, the check will be cashed this week. and thanks to all of you....  My wife is making a card and we will have your names included...

Tiny, 

I just received a message that Rich is going to retire at the end of the month.  I understand that there is a surprise lunch for him in Houston on March 29.  Will you be attending?  Let us know, we'd like to meet with you if you are going to be in town.  Did you receive the $50 check I sent you for Rich's gift?  When I was reconciling my checking account a couple of weeks ago, I noticed it had not cleared yet.  I just want to make sure it did not get lost in the mail.

Good luck on Bisti!

Thanks, Kim.

Gov. Davis announced today his appointment of Mike Peevey as Commissioner at the CPUC to replace Com. Bilas who resigned last week.  Mr. Peevey is the former President of Southern California Edison and as such advocated deregulation.  Consumer group advocates are concerned about his past record and oppose his nomination which is subject to state Senate approval.  Below is an article from the Sacramento Bee.  gh


Davis names ex-Edison chief to PUC
But the action stirs anger: 'Our worst nightmare,' says a consumer lawyer.
By Stuart Leavenworth -- Bee Staff Writer
Published 5:30 a.m. PST Wednesday, March 6, 2002
Gov. Gray Davis has appointed a former president of Southern California Edison to a state panel charged with regulating Edison and other public utilities.
Davis said Michael R. Peevey would bring "more than three decades of experience" to the Public Utilities Commission -- experience that immediately came under fire from the state's consumer groups.
Mike Florio, a lawyer for The Utility Reform Network, said Peevey has a record, both in government and in business, of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers.
"This is a our worst nightmare," Florio said. "It is like putting Dr. Kevorkian in charge of a nursing home."
Others were more supportive. D.J. Smith, a lobbyist who represents large industrial energy users, lauded Peevey as someone "who understands all sides of the energy business" and will be fair to all sides.
"I think he will be objective about Edison because he doesn't owe Edison anything," said Smith, noting that Peevey left the Southern California utility nine years ago.
The husband of Assemblywoman Carol Liu, D-South Pasadena, Peevey replaces PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who resigned last week. Bilas was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson.
If confirmed by the state Senate, Peevey will solidify Davis' control over the PUC, a five-member board that now includes three of the governor's appointees. It also comes at a time when the commission is fighting with the state's other large utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., on terms for PG&E's reorganization in federal bankruptcy court.
PG&E spokesman Ron Low declined to comment on the appointment Tuesday, but last year Peevey was involved with a handshake deal that might have helped PG&E avoid bankruptcy.
Hired by Davis to negotiate with the utility, Peevey reportedly struck a deal with PG&E Chairman Bob Glynn that would have let PG&E charge ratepayers for all its costs of buying wholesale electricity. But other Davis advisers objected to the deal and the negotiations ultimately fell apart.
For three years, Peevey was president of Edison International and Southern California Edison before leaving in 1993 in a reported power struggle with company Chairman John Bryson.
Peevey then became a public affairs consultant and then president of NewEnergy Inc., an energy service provider that was sold in 1999 to AES Corp. After working as an adviser to Davis, he had been CEO of TruePricing Inc. and also has served on the board of Excelergy Corp., an energy software company.
With his new six-year PUC job, Peevey will regulate not only electric utilities but telecommunications giants, water companies, natural gas supplies and other industries.
After a review by PUC lawyers, Peevey will have to divest holdings and resign from positions that could cause a conflict, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said.
Peevy's appointment was one of two Davis made Tuesday. He also appointed John L. Geesman to the board of the Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state power grid.
Since 1985, Geesman has been the managing director of fixed income banking for RBC Dain Rauscher Inc. in San Francisco. He once served on TURN's board.
Consumer groups, which had pressed for a meeting with Davis for the past week, said the he may have timed his Election Day appointment of Peevey to minimize negative media coverage.
Maviglio called that claim "ludicrous." Today's papers, he said, "will be some of the best read this year."

Susan,

Per our conversation today, Transwestern Pipeline and PG&E Trading can wait until after the upcoming holidays to discuss PG&E's right of first refusal on the 61,000 MMBtu per day that is currently posted. In fact, Section 13 (H) of Transwestern's FTS-1 rate schedule indicates that Transwestern could wait until July 31, 2002 to notify PG&E Trading as to the terms of the best offer. PG&E Trading would then have two weeks to notify Transwestern of its desire to match. I, however, suggest that we begin discussions of the outcome of the posting sometime in January.

I hope that your Holiday Season is everything you are hoping it will be. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Best Regards,

Paul

El Paso's proceeding relating to capacity allocation/constraints was stricken from the agenda today at the last minute - wasn't on any information even just prior to the meeting. (RP00-336). 
A draft order was released in the PUC v. El Paso proceeding in which FERC remanded to the ALJ for a limited supplemental hearing on the issue of whether El Paso made all of its capacity available to shippers at its California delivery points in the period of Nov. 2000 - March 2001. (RP00-241). We will probably have this later today.
There has been an order issued in San Diego Gas v. Sellers of Energy which we will have later today - will also send to you.

California:

CPUC - Com. Richard Bilas of the California Public Utilities Commission announced his resignation this week from the Commission effective March 8, 2002 due to health reasons.  Com. Bilas was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson in 1997 and served as Commission President from Feb. 1998 until March 2000.  

PG&E Plan of Reorganization - U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali ruled that the Commission may file its alternative plan of reorganization in the PG&E bankruptcy case and that PG&E does not hold the exclusive right to propose a plan and solicit creditor support.  He gave the Comission until April 15, 2002 to file its plan and draft disclosure statement. Based on Judge Montali's previous ruling regarding conformance to state laws, PG&E is filing a revised plan of its own on March 7, 2002.  Additionally the Judge has appointed a panel of two mediators to conduct mediation between PG&E, the CPUC and the state Attorney General.  Mediation is expected to be conducted during March.

CA Power Contracts.  Earlier this week the CPUC and the state's Electricity Oversight Board (EOB) filed a complaint with FERC under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act which requires that FERC ensure that all wholesale power contracts are "just and reasonable" with respect to both price and terms and conditions.  The complaint addresses 32 contracts with 22 sellers which the CPUC and EOB want terminated as they claim the contracts which are worth $43 billion, were agreed to under duress during a period in which the market was being manipulated.  In the filing the PUC's preliminary calcuations indicate that collectively the contracts are approximately $21 billion above reasonable prices.  Other provisions challenged include, payment priority over bond repayment, evasion of FERC review of the contracts, credit treatment equality, favored nation clauses and termination rights.  Among the sellers, some of the largest include Calpine, Mirant, Williams and Dynegy.

Crude Oil Futures Up Slightly

    Crude oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX edged up $0.05 
to $21.23 per barrel yesterday as the market seemed unsure of which 
way to move. Traders are still concerned that escalating tensions 
between the US and Iraq could produce supply disruptions later this 
year. But, at the same time, they are worried about the ever-growing 
crude inventories reported by both the API and EIA this week. 
President Bushs statement that the US is looking at ways to overthrow 
Saddam Hussein has temporarily overridden bearish fundamentals, even 
with stockpiles brimming and the failure of OPEC and other producing 
countries to stick to their self imposed quotas. OPEC, excluding 
Iraq, pumped more than 1 million bpd over their limit last month. And 
it is widely thought that Russia is skirting its commitment to cut 
150,000 bpd by increasing exports of products. Products ended up 
mixed yesterday. Heating oil futures for March delivery on the NYMEX 
added $0.0022 to $0.5562 per gallon. March gasoline futures on the 
NYMEX lost $0.0064 to $0.6026 per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil 
futures for April delivery on the IPE were down $0.10 to $20.82 per 
barrel.

BP Shares Jump Higher


    Shares of BP jumped 3.5% higher yesterday on increased Middle 
East tensions that were prompting some switching out of Shell, which 
last week had disappointing earnings. Volume was very high. Last 
Tuesday BP reported lower 4th quarter earnings, but were above 
analysts' forecasts that also gave a positive outlook, particularly 
on reserve replacement and output growth. In contrast, Shell's 4th 
quarter numbers were at the lower than expected.

Compromise Proposed for California Exempted Leases 


    A compromise has been proposed to the stalemate between 
California and the federal government over 40 offshore California oil 
and natural gas tracts that the White House wants to open for new 
development. New oil drilling off California's coast has been banned 
since 1989, but oil production has continued at existing state and 
federal tracts. California says that it has the right to review the 
environmental impact of any proposed new exploration under a 1998 
Clinton era law. But the tracts were exempted from the ban on new oil 
drilling because the leases were so old, some going back about 20 
years. In 1999 the Secretary of the Interior extended the companies' 
leases and ordered an environmental impact review. The current 
administration contends that because the tracts were exempted, it is 
possible to drill on those leases. California filed a lawsuit to halt 
new production and won a court order blocking new drilling pending 
full review. That order is currently under appeal in a circuit court. 
Government estimates show the leases, which are near Santa Barbara's 
coast, could hold 1 billion barrels of oil. The area also holds 
reserves of natural gas. A California Senator has proposed 
legislation to remove the exemption and establish the area as an 
ecological preserve. In return, the leaseholders would be offered 
credits, which could run anywhere from $1 billion to $2.8 billion to 
be used for bids on lease tracts in the central and western Gulf 
already scheduled for development.

Cabot Finalizes Year-End Reserves and Provides Drilling Results

    Cabot Oil & Gas has announced the final results of its year-end 
reserve audit. Total proved reserves increased 13% to 1,154.1 Bcfe at 
December 31, 2001, compared to 1,018.7 Bcfe in the prior year.  
Driving this increase was 113.5 Bcfe from drilling additions and 
146.8 Bcfe from acquisitions. The drilled additions and the acquired 
reserves were added at a cost of $1.68 per Mcfe. Revisions, caused 
primarily by lower pricing ($2.65 per Mcf on the last day of 2001 
versus $9.63 per Mcf on the last day of 2000), removed 42.7 Bcfe from 
reserves and added $.33 to the overall finding cost level. The 
Company replaced 268% of production during the year. The 2001 capital 
program included $144.3 million (versus $75.2 million in 2000) for 
drilling and dry hole, along with $32.5 million (versus $16.2 million 
in 2000) for lease acquisition and seismic that will benefit future 
years.

Baker Hughes Posts 4th Quarter Profit
  
    Baker Hughes said that it made a 4th quarter profit of $126 
million, or $0.37 per share, compared to last years 4th quarter loss 
of $41 million, or $0.12 per share due to strong international 
drilling business. In the 4th quarter of 2000, Baker Hughes lost $41 
million, or $0.12 per share. However, it warned that its 2002 
oilfield revenue would be 5% - 7% below that of 2001, because a mild 
winter, conservation and sluggish economy will keep the lid on energy 
demand and impact drilling in the US during the first half of this 
year. In 2002 spending in North America will drop by 15% - 20% from 
2001 levels. Baker Hughes expects international oil and natural gas 
exploration to grow slightly, because of its long-term nature and it 
is funded by big, integrated oil companies with a strong cash flow 
and less vulnerability to daily price swings. Baker Hughes said it 
expects 2002 operating profit to be about $1.10-$1.25 per share, 
below the $1.29 average estimate of analysts. Excluding one-time 
charges, earnings rose to $132.8 million, or $0.39 per share, from 
$81.0 million, or $0.24 per share a year ago, compared to an average 
estimate of analysts of $0.35 per share. One-time charges include a 
$10.3 million write-down related to its 30% stake in Western Geco for 
obsolete equipment, a $6.8 million charge for impairment of 
exploration and production properties and a one-time gain of $4.2 
million gain related to its exiting the exploration business in 2000. 
Fourth quarter revenue was $1.376 billion, slightly down from $1.384 
billion a year ago. Baker Hughes shares closed  flat on the NYMEX 
yesterday.

Nexen Not Looking for Merger
  
    Nexen says it has the prospects and finances to grow without 
merging with another company, such as the one Alberta Energy and 
PanCanadian are planning. The PanCanadian and AEC merger would create 
the world's largest independent exploration and production firm, 
fueling speculation about which companies might be the next to merge. 
Nexen, which operates in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Nigeria, South 
America and Yemen, had been listed by some as a possible target. But 
the object of the AEC-PanCanadian merger is to become large enough to 
attract US investors and erase the stock-market discount that 
Canadian companies have endured. However, Nexen may find that 
discount harder to deal with after AEC and PanCanadian close their 
deal because it will be much smaller than the combined company, to be 
called EnCana. Nexen earned C$30 million, or C$0.16 per share, down 
from C$147 million, or C$1.15 per share a year earlier due to weak 
oil and natural gas prices. Analysts had expected earnings of C$0.03 
per share on average. Cash flow fell to C$220 million, or C$1.15 per 
share, from C$439 million, or C$3.51 per share. Nexen produced 
273,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the 4th quarter, a 7% 
increase from a year earlier. It received an average C$25.22 per 
barrel for its oil, a drop of 35% percent, and natural gas for C$3.15 
per Mcf, down 62% from the last quarter of 2000. This year, Nexen 
expects to spend C$1.24 billion on its operations, 11% lower than in 
2001. The company is looking to boost full-year output by 6% to 
284,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Kim, I do save these on the shared drive under TW-NNG/TW Desk/Weekly Bullets or better 

Why not let me save a copy to your drive under Weekly Bullets.  I'll create a folder for you if you don't have one.

Okay?  Okay....

Audrey,

As a matter of practice, would you automatically email me the final bullets document after Steve approves?  I will then save it in my word file and use it to start the next weeks bullets.

Thanks, Kim.  :>)

Subject: Paris


John,
I need your advice.  My sister and I have decided to take a trip together
this fall.  We are interested in about a 6-7 day trip (does not include
travel days), splitting it between London and Paris.

We thought we'd fly to London and spend a few days, then take the tunnel
bullet train to Paris and spend a few day and return to London to fly home.

Our questions are:

1.  When is a better time to visit Paris, September or October - we want to
avoid high tourist season and maybe capitalize on lower hotel prices.

2.  My sister has visited London many times and has friends there, so we
won't have any trouble with an agenda, however, we've never been to Paris.

3.  For 2-3 days what would you recommend we do/see in Paris?
Highlights: the Louvre, the Orsay, Saint Chapelle (behind Notre Dame), the
sewer tour (I'm not kidding), shopping at Galleries Lafayette and Printemps,
the Eiffel Tower, other stuff?

4.  What reasonably priced hotels would you recommend in Paris?
Kim found one in the more residential area that is near ??

5.  Any other advice/tips?
Try to eat at Cafe/Bistro Bacchanal (something like that).  We ate there on
one trip and couldn't get in the next time.
Buy your Metro tickets by the carnet (10 at a time).

Thank you so much,
Jane

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================================
Summary of February 10, 2002

======================================================

Dear Folks ?


   I want to thank Stephanie Warfield for filling in for me this past
weekend. I was away making a private retreat. Stephanie always does a good
job.

   At the gathering on Sunday John Staley volunteered to facilitate the
creation of a book discussion group. Jerrilynn Dougherty volunteered to
assist with this. If you would like to know more, you can contact John at

Welcomingfriends@aol.com

   Richard Wingfield forwarded to me a list of the folks who have committed
to step forward to support the work in Bolivia. Each of the following
persons has agreed to support one month at $250.
   1. Wayne Herbert
   2. Bill Kerley
   3. Richard Wingfield
   4. Robert Bell
   5. Phill Lewis
   6. Kim Watson/Richard Stang
   7. Kristine & Paul Brooks
   8. Nancy Pustka
   9. Jean Snyder
  10. Marte Nelson
  11. John M. Howard. Jr.
  12. James Sasser.

   Thanks to you all.

   Tomorrow is, for Christians, the beginning of Lent. It is a significant
time, full of rich rituals. It is a time when we are encouraged to seek for
clarity about those two significant spiritual questions - "who are we and
what are we to do."

   With renewed threats of terrorist activity it is easy for us to forget
these. I'm looking forward to being with you this coming Sunday as we
continue our conversation along the way from here to there. More on this in
the preview that will come to you later this week.

Much love,


Bill Kerley

RISK, WHERE YOU READ IT FIRST: 
  _____  

XCEL SEEKS $20B UTILITY MERGER; LOOKS TO BUY BACK NRG 

Xcel Energy, one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S., is courting
FirstEnergy, TXU and Entergy as potential merger partners and at the same
time is looking to repurchase the remaining 20% stake of its unregulated IPP
affiliate, NRG Energy, which it partially spun off in May 2000. 

U.K. UTILITY PUTS WIND BIZ ON THE BLOCK

U.K. utility Innogy has put its U.S. wind farm business up for sale and
hired J.P. Morgan to find a buyer. The portfolio, which consists of two 20
MW farms in California and a further 600 MW of projects in construction or
under development in California, Texas and Pennsylvania, could fetch Innogy
some $300 million.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for February 3, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   Wow! What a ton of feedback I've gotten from the past two Sundays.
I'll share that with you this week. Most of it is about the
presentation on our work in Bolivia. Some of it about community-
building.

   Some of the more "theological/theoretical" questions I've gotten
have to do with the general area of "how do we know what we know and
how do we know if it is true?"

   If our goal is to take the journey of life in such a way that we do
not die an unlived life, how do we know that the choices we make about
being and doing are correct and true?

   A couple of years ago there was a movement that attempted to answer
this question by the phrase WWJD - What Would Jesus Do? What, for
example, would Jesus do about the terrorist attacks on 9/11?   Then
there were the copycats of that position - What Would Buddha Do? etc.
My beautiful bride suggested WWGUD - What Would A Grown-Up Do?

   This week when we gather I want to talk with you about these
terribly important matters ?

     How Do We Know - For Sure

                And

          How Do We Decide?

   I hope you choose to be present.

Much love,


Bill Kerley

	FYI.  Is everyone comfortable that we are NOT creating an imbalance with Sid
	Richardson due to fuel?  Just want to be sure we should not check out any
	additional information.  Terry, thanks for your prompt reply.  Thanks. Lynn

In the OBA meeting held today 01/03/02. Is the fuel being nominated or not at the Sid Richardson point #500395 or L.E. 8729? Yes it is and has been nominated as far back as I can retrieve information in TMS. The point came active in 12/1995 and remains active today. It is also part of their main OBA contract #21758. According to the information in CBS it was nominated and scheduled back then also. If there is more information or questions, please let me know. Thank you.

Dynegy Takes Over Northern Natural Gas Pipeline 

 

Dynegy, which acquired the Northern Natural Gas pipeline from Enron
after investing $1.5 billion in the energy trader, will take

over the pipelines trading and marketing today. The system, valued at
$2.7 billion, runs 16,600 miles from Texas to the Great Lakes. Enron had
contested the takeover after Dynegy backed out of its plan to buy Enron
for $23 billion in November. Earlier this month, Enron gave up the
pipeline, but is proceeding with a $10 billion lawsuit against Dynegy
for terminating their deal. Northern Natural has a capacity of 4.3 Bcf
of natural gas per day and has valuable connection points with other
pipelines. Although Dynegy operates many pipelines, Northern Natural is
their first foray into pipeline ownership. Dynegy paid $23 million to
complete the purchase and named Daniel Dienstbier as the systems
president, a position he held before becoming president of Enron's Gas
Pipeline Group in 1985. Dynegy also assumed $900 million of Northern
Natural's debt. Enron employees will run and maintain Northern Natural
until Enron's option to buy it back expires June 30th. But most think
that is unlikely to happen, given Enron's current state of affairs. 

 

FERC Approves Tuscarora Pipeline Expansion

 

The  has given final approval to Tuscarora Gas Transmission's plan to
expand its pipeline system to bring more natural gas to industrial
customers in northern Nevada. The Tuscarora natural gas pipeline was
built in 1995 in a partnership between Sierra Pacific Resources and
TransCanada PipeLines. The $60 million, 14-mile pipeline extension would
almost double the capacity in the area from 125 MMcf per day to 220 MMcf
per day. The expanded pipeline capacity will serve Duke Energy's 540 MW
plant near Wadsworth, Nevada and Morgan Stanley's 360 MW power plant
near Reno. The 229-mile pipeline stretches from Malin, Oregon through
northern California to Sierra Pacific's Tracy power station near Reno.

Bill,
 
The following is a brief desciption of the above mentioned project.
 
The Bloomfield air inlet cooler project consist of the installation of evaporative pads around the existing air filters to reduce the ambient air temperature into units 1 & 2 turbines.  This will allow the turbines to run more efficiently and increase the amount of horsepower developed on hot summer days.  The evaporative system will not be operated on non-summer condition days.  The increase in horsepower will be about 350 Hp per unit which will not exceed the current air quality permit.  The permit limitation is in excess of 5800 Hp and the evaporative system will not increase the horespower no more than 5000 Hp on hot summer days.
 
If you need more information of clarification, please call.

The motor is on a trailer and will be on the road before nightfall.  Disassembly will begin either Sunday or Monday morning.  (Brandy Jones, shop foreman for IRS, indicated it would be more like Monday.)  The team will have a rep on site for disassembly and Todd Ingalls along with Brian Dills will be in discussions with IRS so that an update is available for Monday afternoons conf. call.  

The San Juan Team has done an excellant job in expediting this removal.  

Questions up to this point?  Please let me know.  Thanks

Subject:	#3 Bisti Motor Update

Contractors are on location and making good progress this morning.  The heavy iron used to skid the motor in position for a lift through the ceiling is being transported from the San Juan Station.  Motor wiring disconnects have been completed.   The roof is being removed and the crane should be on location this evening.  IRS has sub-ed Foutz and Bursham for necessary welding, support personnel and some heavy equipment.    The compressor coupling has not yet been disconnected as one final runout will be taken per IRS's request.  Exhaust ducting has been removed and will have to be shipped in for repairs.  (the foam material sprayed in the duct has burned and will need to be replaced)  

Now anticipating a lift sometime tomorrow morning instead of tomorrow evening, if all continues to move along as well as it has to this point.

Subject:	Bisti Motor Update

The Bisti Motor failed Thursday evening and resulted in a station ESD.  Initially, it was thought that the ESD was the result of a faulure in one of the fire detectors.  Once the alarms were cleared by the Operators and the station was totally reset, an attempt at a restart was made.  A variety of alarms (primarily related to the Motor RTD's) started flagging.  The Operators continued through a trouble shooting process that lasted until late this afternoon at which point it was determined that the motor had failed.  

Industrial Repair Service (IRS) out of Farmington Nm. was contacted and a rep. (Doug Harrison shop foreman) is due on site this evening (Friday) to further evaluate and provide timelines/schedules for removal.  Todd Ingalls has been in discussions with IRS's Paul Heikkinen (505-860-2398) in an effort to coordinate this removal process.   At this point, Operations is proceeding with a turnkey scope of work request from IRS for removal, repair and re-installation.  Moving as quickly as possible to turnaround this motor, field estimates tonight are in the range of 4 to 6 weeks.  We are looking at a "stator" failure this time versus the historic "rotor" failures that have occured at this facility.  

A couple of issues need to be discussed so I have set up a conf. call for 1:00 pm CST Monday.  (877-795-3687  pin 151120)  Updates should be available by this time.  (In the mean while, we are moving forward, pending IRS's availability, with the removal of the equipment)
