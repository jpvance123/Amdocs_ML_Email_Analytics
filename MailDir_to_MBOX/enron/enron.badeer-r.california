   Market Participants:
   When the ISO released its Congestion Management
Reform (CMR) Recommendation on July 11, we indicated that we would
subsequently release additional Appendices with supporting information on
Friday, July 21.  (Appendices A (Terminology and Acronyms) and B (Locational
Price Dispersion Study Results) were released on July 11 along with the
draft CMR Recommendation.)  Unfortunately, we are unable to complete them
according to schedule. We will release individual Appendices as they are
finalized, with the intention of releasing the following Appendices by
Friday, July 28:
    Appendix D (Assessment of CMR Recommendation
with Respect to Stakeholder Evaluation Criteria);
 Appendix E (Discussion of CMR Options not Adopted);
 Appendix F (Stakeholder Input for CMR Recommendation Package);
 Appendix G (Preliminary Assessment of ISO and Stakeholder System
Impacts); and
 Appendix H (Additional Forward Market RMR Cost Data Supporting LRA
Recommendations).
   We are planning to release Appendix C (Market
Separation Study Results) by August 15.
   We apologize for this delay and thank you for your
patience.
   Byron Woertz, DCR

  Market Participants:

  The California ISO values Stakeholders' comments on the
Congestion Management Reform (CMR) proposal released on July 11, 2000.  Both
your positive and negative responses are essential to guide us in refining
the CMR recommendation.  We have prepared the attached template for you to
use in submitting your comments.  Receiving your comments in this format
will enable us to understand and respond to your input efficiently.  We will
also post this template at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html>  under the heading
"Congestion Management Reform Recommendation - DRAFT."
  In the first section, we ask that you respond to the
following two questions (summary answers, bulleted lists, etc. are fine):
1. Which fundamental market design features and principles identified
in the proposal should be kept?  Why?
2. Which fundamental market design features and principles identified
in the proposal should be removed?  Why?
  In the second section, please provide detailed comments on
specific sections of the proposal using the template provided.  We have
structured the template to facilitate your detailed comments on Sections 4,
7, 8, 9 and 10 and Appendices A and B, since these are the sections that
contain the main features of the proposal.  The template also includes a
space for general comments on sections 1, 2, 3, 5 and 11.  Since Section 6
is an overview of the proposal, we have not included a comment section in
the template for that section.  We ask that comments include:
* Which main features you think should be retained and why;
* Which main features you think should be removed or modified.  Please
be specific on why, and how you would modify that feature to address the
problem you have identified; and
* Which features and details you think are missing and should be
added, why, and how you suggest adding that feature.
  All three parts-what, why and how you recommend changing the
proposal-are necessary for us to respond to your comments.
  We would like to emphasize our need to receive your comments
on features of the proposal that you like.  Reviews can tend to focus on
features with which reviewers are dissatisfied.  Without hearing support for
features that stakeholders like, it is possible that some broadly supported
features could be changed or eliminated, based on others' stated
disagreement.
  Please submit your initial comments by 5:00 p.m. PDT on
Friday, July 28.  There will be other opportunities for feedback, but we
would like to include a summary of Stakeholders' initial comments in our
discussion with the ISO Governing Board on August 1.  Please send your
comments, using the attached template, via e-mail to bwoertz@caiso.com
<mailto:bwoertz@caiso.com>  and use the phrase "CMR Proposal - Stakeholder
Comments" in the Subject line.  We plan to treat your comments as public and
to include a summary of Stakeholders' comments with the materials that will
go to the ISO Governing Board and/or to FERC.
  The California ISO greatly appreciates the time, effort and
expertise Stakeholders have contributed to the CMR process.  We look forward
to receiving your valuable comments to allow us to further refine and
improve this proposal.

Dan Douglass summarized this.  This really puts CA and the ISO on notice that 
they cannot confiscate the power as they seem ready to do -- FERC reiterates 
that the generators can sell power wherever they want because the cap is a 
cap on ISO purchases.  ANd if the ISO want to set a sale price cap it has to 
file with FERC, wait 60 days and amend its contract

Subject: FERC Order on Morgan Stanley Complaint Against ISO


We have good news on the ISO price caps front.  The FERC has made it
clear that ISO does not have the ability to mandate that generators sell to 
ISO at its price caps and that the proper response to inadequate supply is to 
lift the price caps.

On Friday, the FERC issued its Order on Complaint in connection with the July 
10 complaint filed by Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MS").  As you may 
recall, MS requested FERC to issue a stay of the ISO's maximum purchase price 
authority and to direct the ISO to reverse any price cap reductions.  MS 
sought Fast Track processing pursuant to Rule 206(h), which was granted by 
FERC on the grounds that the complaint "warrants expeditious action."

As a quick background summary for you, last November, FERC issued an order 
approving Tariff Amendment 21 which extended ISO's price cap authority 
through 11/15/00.  That order stated that the ISO "maximum purchase price was 
not a cap on what the seller may charge the ISO, but a cap on what the ISO 
was willing to pay."  The Commission said that sellers dissatisfied with the 
price cap could "choose to sell those services into the California Power 
Exchange or bilateral markets."

FERC notes in Friday's Order that the 6/28 the ISO's Board resolution lowered 
the caps to $500 and ISO further directed that, "To the extent permitted by 
law, regulation and pre-existing contract, Management shall direct generators 
to bid in all their capacity when system load exceeds 38,000 MW."

The MS complaint alleged that the cap reduction was unlawful and would, 
"threaten the stability and integroty of the marketplace."  MS also requested 
an emergency technical conference to examine ISO's justification for the 
price cap reduction.

FERC denied the MS stay request, as well as its request that the $750 maximum 
purchase price be reinstated.  The Commission reiterates that it is not 
approving a cap on sellers' prices, because they can sell at whatever price 
they want.  Rather ISO has simply stated the maximum price it is willing to 
pay.  "Because sellers are not required to sell to the ISO, the ISO cannot 
dictate their price."

Importantly, however, FERC also states that, "ISO has no more or less ability 
to procure capacity and energy than any other buyer of these services....if 
the ISO is unable to elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced 
purchase price ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they 
choose), it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to 
meet its needs."  [Emphasis added]  FERC then notes that this may lead to an 
increase in Out of Market ("OOM") calls and that OOM calls are not subject to 
a maximum purchase price.

Also, with regard to the ISO's resolution stating that generators must bid 
their capacity into the ISO markets when system load exceeds 38,000 MW, FERC 
states clearly that, "such a requirement is not permitted by our November  12 
Order and the ISO tariff."  [Emphasis added]

FERC goes on to say that any requirement to sell to ISO in conjunction with a 
maximum purchase price would require significant revisions to ISO's market 
rules, which could not be made effective without a corresponding amendment to 
ISO's tariff.  This would require 60 days' advance notice, "and could not be 
implemented prior to Commission approval.  As stated above, our November 12 
Order was clearly based on the premise that the proper response to inadequate 
supply (due to a low maximum purchase price) is to raise the maximum purchase 
price."

ISO is then "put on notice that any amendment to mandate sales must be 
accompanied by a demonstration that this extreme measure is the proper 
response to low supplies in the ISO markets."

Concurrences were filed by Commissioners Massey and Hebert.  Massey suggests 
that the state has to facilitate solutions to market issues, such as risk 
management tools, removing constraints on hedging opportunities, introducing 
real time pricing through real time metering and expediting approval of new 
generation and transmission projects in California.  Hebert says that the 
previous November Order tried to "straddle the fence" and that, "Today, the 
Commission at least starts to lean slightly in the right direction of 
recognizing that we have a role."  He then reiterates his preference for 
removing all price caps.  He also suggests that, "Getting to the bottom of 
the problem, in my view, requires us to begin a proceeding to rescind our 
approval of the ISO as operator of the California grid.  The record supports 
such a move."  He refers approvingly to the Collins resignation letter, 
stating that it, "thoughtfully outlines consequences to the market of a 
return to 'command and control.' "  Hebert states that, "The independence of 
the ISO's governing structure stands threatened.  We should 'stand up,' to 
quote the resignation letter."  Hebert advocates opening a section 206 
proceeding now, as part of the recently announced inquiry into bulk power 
markets, "including the California markets."

This decision makes it clear that ISO cannot lower the caps at tomorrow's 
meeting and expect that sellers will be required to sell to it at that 
price.  This is an important development and very good news in our ongoing 
efforts to seek economic sanity at the ISO.

Please call if you have any questions.

Market Participants,

Attention: Settlements and Scheduling Personnel

Your participation is requested in the second iteration of 10-Minute
Settlement Market Simulation.

As communicated on 7/20/00, the ISO has postponed the August 1, 2000,
implementation of 10-minute settlements in order to accommodate additional
end-to-end testing and market simulation.  The ISO's new target for
implementation is the last week of August, 2000, contingent upon the
successful completion of the second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation
and ISO's 10 day written notice to FERC.

The second 10-Minute Settlement Market Simulation is scheduled to begin on
Tuesday, August 1, 2000.  The ISO will hold a kickoff meeting conference
call on Thursday, July 27, from 1:30 - 3:00 p.m., to summarize the status of
the first Market Simulation, discuss the second Market Simulation logistics,
and review the Market Simulation Plan.

All Market Participants are strongly urged to participate in this simulation
to identify any outstanding issues that may affect implementation for
Scheduling Coordinators and the ISO.

Please respond to Cathy Young at cyoung@caiso.com by 3:00 p.m. on Friday if
you intend to participate.  The remainder of this message contains the
kickoff meeting Agenda, Market Simulation Schedule, and necessary system set
up documentation for the simulation.

Market Participants,

Several market participants have been engaged in a practice of scheduling
large amounts of non-firm counter flows on congested branch groups in order
to earn hour-ahead congestion revenues and then not providing those counter
flows in real time.  This occurred during a Stage 1 emergency on 7-20-00.
This practice creates a significant reliability problem for the ISO and is
to the detriment of market efficiency.

This notice is intended to inform Market Participants that the ISO
Department of Market Analysis considers this a potentially serious "gaming"
practice as defined in the ISO Tariff MMIP 2.1.3. The ISO DMA will be
investigating any Market Participant found to be engaging in this activity
and will take appropriate corrective actions.

Carl has been working with Enron and others and the ISO to develop a model 
that works for CA as well as for the Desert Southwest (which the ISO would 
then operate).  I think this summary explains the kinds of things were trying 
to get in congestion management reform.  I'll send a few other things to look 
at.

Subject: CAISO Congestion Model

Ziad:

Per our conversation this morning, attached is a summary of what I view to be 
the key attributes of a "reformed" zonal congestion model.  The document does 
not fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion 
reform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some 
details) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market 
participants are proposing.

This summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who 
haven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be 
too far off.  

I am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I 
offered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the 
ISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process 
rather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference 
between what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.  
(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the "hour-ahead" 
process works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way 
scheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative 
in acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal 
counterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real 
possibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether 
integration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will 
rely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the 
models for the region.  

Carl

[Sue, Curt, Jim, Gary, Alex, Kent, Steven, John and Barney: I'd appreciate 
any feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to 
cfi1@tca-us.com, NOT the enron address from which this e-mail was sent.

To Market Participants:

At the Market Issues Forum yesterday, Jeanne Sole led the presentation on
Distributed Generation, presenting the initial ISO thinking based on recent
proceedings and feedback from participants.   In the context of the CPUC
proceeding on distributed generation, the ISO has identified ISO
requirements that should be clarified or revised to accommodate distributed
generation.    The ISO has scheduled a meeting on August 31 , in Folsom,
from 10:30 AM -3 PM  to discuss its initial ideas on
clarifications/revisions. The ISO invites entities interested in discussing
these ideas and other ideas related to distributed generation to attend.  It
is our schedule now to take this issue to the Governing Board in October.

The ISO will distribute information on its initial ideas along with more
information on the location of the meeting by Friday August 18.

Market Participants,

Yesterday at the Market Issues Forum, we presented a discussion on long-term
price cap authority.  This is a matter for discussion now because the
previously granted authority from FERC expires on Nov. 15, 2000.  Attached
is the white paper discussing this topic.  We will seek Board approval on
this matter at the September 6-7 Board meeting.  If you have comments on
this paper, please forward them to Keith Casey at kcasey@caiso.com.

We need to be careful how we position this.  I'm concerned that this may be 
perceived as Enron re-entering the residential market -- even though we're 
proposing to supply SDG&E rather than direct end-use customers.  How does 
this compare to the other eight offers SDG&E has received?

  Market Participants:
  This notice is to inform you that the  ISO is canceling the
CMR stakeholder meetings that were scheduled for August 4 and August 8.  We
are doing so in order to be responsive to Stakeholders' needs for greater
detail as articulated in the two most recent Stakeholder meetings on July 19
and 25.
  As you know, after the July 13-14 introduction to the CME
Recommendation, we scheduled additional meetings (July 19th and 25th, August
4th and 8th) to discuss each element of the Recommendation in greater
detail. We have received many questions and requests for change on all parts
of the Recommendation during the past few weeks.  As a result, we determined
that we needed more time for internal discussion in order to give you the
level of detail that would allow a more meaningful discussion of the
specific recommendations and potential modifications.  This will allow us to
address both your questions and your suggested changes.
  We have rescheduled these detailed discussions for three
consecutive days, August 15-17.  In these meetings, we will address:
* FTRs;
* Day Ahead and Hour Ahead Congestion Management;
* Recallable Transmission;
* Real Time Operations;
* New Generator Interconnection Policy;
* Long Term Grid Planning; and
* Questions and issues on Local Reliability Service that arose from
the July 25 Stakeholder meeting.
  We will also meet on August 25 to discuss the ISO's final
recommendation to the ISO Governing Board.
  We apologize for any inconvenience this change has caused
you, but believe that taking time to develop more details on these topics
will allow more productive discussions.

i would categorize things in the following manner:

day ahead markets we want bid information (e.g., ancillary service markets, 
transmission markets, generation adjustment bids, load adjustment bids, 
import adjustment bids, export adjustment bids), initial preferred schedules, 
final schedules.
hour ahead markets we want the same thing.
real time market we want bid information, beep dispatch instructions.
after the fact we want actual meter information to get actual unit by unit 
production and load zone consumption.
per bob badeer, we want to see transmission information broken down between 
new firm use and existing transmission contracts.  we need adjustment bids, 
day ahead schedules, hour ahead schedules, real time adjustments, actual 
flows, and transmission availability by category of ownership (etcs, nfu).  
we want this for all transmission lines.
unit outage information.  planned outages and forced outages.
rmr calls.

Jeff,
 Tim told me to put together a list of inormation we would want from the ISO. 
As a general rule, we want all information released. Here are some of the 
highlights:

1.  ETC schedules on each transmission line (both DA and HA). We want to see 
the ETC schedules at the same time they are submitted to the ISO on the 
following paths:
 a. path 15
 b. path 26
 c. nw1
 d. nw3
 e. az2
 f. az3
 g. lc1

2. Actual flows on each path. (real time flows)

3. How many mw's get cut on each path DA? i.e. how many mw's are adjustment 
bid out of the stack

4. Intrazonal Cong
 a. What paths have intra-zonal cong
 b. How many mw's flow, how many get cut on a DA/HA basis

5. BEEP stack

6. All load and generation bids DA by SC

7. Real time production from each plant

Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

The ISO has posted the CPUC subpoena on its website at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/26/2000072610262610454.pdf>   As stated
in a message forwarded yesterday to market participants and scheduling
coordinators, the CPUC has agreed to extend the deadline for a reply to
Friday July 28, although the ISO has been informed today that the extension
is only until NOON on Friday.  In addition, the ISO discussed the reference
to an affidavit in the subpoena with the CPUC and was informed that this
results from a typo which will be corrected in a corrected document sent by
federal express to the ISO yesterday (the words attached affidavit will be
replaced with the word attachments).  The ISO has accepted federal express
service of the subpoena.

The ISO has raised confidentiality concerns with the CPUC and the CPUC
agreed to circulate a draft of a confidentiality agreement to the ISO today.
The ISO will forward the draft to market participants and scheduling
coordinators as soon as we receive it.  Once again the ISO reiterates to
market participants that to the extent they have outstanding issues as to
the subpoena, these should be raised directly with the appropriate entity.
The ISO intends to comply with the subpoena on Friday unless it receives a
legally sufficient communication to the contrary from the CPUC or a court.

Finally, a few market participants have requested that the ISO make
available several letters forwarded to the EOB discussing confidential
treatment.  These letters are attached.

Questions should be directed to Jeanne M. Sol, at 916-608-7144.

  Market Participants:

  At the May ISO Governing Board meeting the Board directed
Management to bring back to the Board a recommendation on the "parameters
and process" for proceeding with a competitive solicitation (Valley-Rainbow
RFP) to determine if there are cost-effective and reliable alternatives to
SDG&E's proposed Valley-Rainbow transmission project. The specific Board
motion can be found at:

found at http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/sdge500kvtrans.html.
<http://www.caiso.com/thegrid/planning/sdge500kvtrans.html>
  These matters are scheduled to be addressed at the August 1
Board meeting. Attached is a memo that outlines ISO Management's preliminary
thoughts and recommendations on how to structure the process for conducting
and the parameters of the Valley-Rainbow RFP.  Please provide us your
thoughts and feedback on these matters no later COB Friday, July 21.  Please
send your comments to: sgreenleaf@caiso.com <mailto:sgreenleaf@caiso.com>
and btheaker@caiso.com <mailto:btheaker@caiso.com> . While the
recommendations outlined below are clearly a work-in-progress, it is
imperative that we receive your substantive feedback early so that we can
develop a fair and reasonable final recommendation. Thanks for your time and
consideration.

Market Participants,

The California ISO  is initiating this Request for Bids in an effort to
obtain up to 3,000 MW of new generation resources to allow the ISO to
operate the ISO Control Area to meet Applicable Reliability Criteria under
peak Demand conditions during the Summer Period of 2001.

While the ISO seeks to acquire generation resources under this RFB through
one-year agreements, it will also consider bids that require an ISO
commitment for the Summer Periods of 2002 and 2003 if responses proposing
one-year arrangements prove insufficient to meet the ISO's requirements.

The RFB is attached to this email and posted on the ISO Web site at

http://www1.caiso.com/clientserv/stakeholders/


Inquiries regarding this RFB should be directed in writing or electronically
to Brian Theaker as noted on the first page of the RFB.

  Market Participants,

  The California ISO is conducting an Internet site usability
study to determine how we can improve our Internet site. Toward this end, we
have contracted with Carta, Inc. to conduct a site study and recommend
revisions for the site. Stakeholder involvement is an important part of this
process.  We have prepared a Web Site Usability Survey as a part of this
effort. This survey is on-line at our site.

  Please take a few minutes to fill out the survey at
http://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html
<http://www.caiso.com/contact/survey.html> . Your feedback is vital to the
success of this program. Responses will be sent directly to Carta for review
and tabulation.

  Please note, this project does not involve the OASIS section
of our site. The OASIS redesign project is a separate effort. See
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/xml/ <http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/xml/>
for information on the OASIS redesign effort.

  If you have any questions, please contact the ISO Webmaster.
Thank you for your continued support.

  Pursuant to the ISO's Governing Board decision in October
1999 and FERC's ruling in March 2000, the ISO has begun releasing market bid
information, lagged by a six month period and without revealing the names of
bidders, beginning on August 1, 2000 for operating date February 1, 2000.
Bid data will be provided for the ISO's ancillary service markets, real-time
energy market, and congestion management market.

  These data can be found on the ISO's web site at
(http://www.caiso.com/marketops/OASIS/
<http://www.caiso.com/marketops/OASIS/> ) and will be updated daily.

proposed decision Lynch will release today reversing last Thursday's decisi=
on=20
rejecting (0-5) retail price caps in San Diego.  The draft decision she=20
proposes would establish an "interim" retail rate cap only for SDG&E=20
residential and small commercial customers.  She proposes to use a "balanci=

account" to finance the cap.  Though it looks like the "interim" cap would=

extend through December 2003, there is one place in the decision that state=

the cap should only extend through December 2000.

Subject: Governor's Press Conference -- Shot Across the Bow


Governor Davis held a press conference today at which he accused
"out-of-state generators" of price gouging and market manipulation.  He
called on FERC to expedite their investigation of the market and to provide
for consumer rebates if FERC cannot conclude that California prices are
"just and reasonable."

Below are my notes from the press conference.  Attached is the Governor's
press release.

Karen Edson

Notes from Gov. Davis=01, Press Conference:


Opening Statement
Record hot temperatures; lack of supply; price manipulation have created th=
e
crisis.
Electricity is the life blood of the State's economy.
He (the Governor) has responded with several recent steps.
Among them is his request that the AG & FERC examine price manipulation

1st Point
He is calling on the CPUC to establish a price stability rate for consumers
and business.
His intent is to reduce rates to $55-$65/mo. for next year or two.  (This
point was unclear.  Did he mean rates, bills, or what?)
Customers need predictable, reliable, affordable rates

2nd Point
The Governor called on President Clinton and Chairman Hoecker to expedite a=
n
investigation of the unconscionable rates being charged by out-of-state
generators to California utilities
The Governor wants FERC to make evidentiary findings that rates are just an=
d
reasonable.  If FERC can=01,t make such findings, he wants them to require
consumer rebates.  (This portion of his comments is not reflected in the
attached press release.  It is taken right from the script of Senator Steve
Peace.)

3rd Point
Believes deregulation will work. Generators must be held responsible.  When
gouging and extorting; you must pay the price.

ISO FALL 1999 UFE PROJECT
RETROACTIVE MARKET ADJUSTMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

June 15, 2000

MARKET PARTICIPANTS & SC SETTLEMENT CONTACTS;

NOTIFICATION OF RETRO-ACTIVE 1999 UFE MARKET CORRECTION

On July 3, 2000, the ISO, consistent with its commitment to the Market
Participants, will initiate Unaccounted for Energy (UFE) market adjustments,
for Market Settlements from August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999.

These adjustments result from the correction of  meter data errors,
identified and corrected by the ISO UFE Project. The Market Participants
have been very cooperative in working with the ISO.  The mutual objectives
were to assure accurate settlement of Imbalance Energy, to rectify start-up
meter data management problems and to minimize UFE.

The overall magnitude of erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project is
approximately 1,100,000 MWhs or $ 70,000,000.  The ISO Settlements and
Metering Department staffs are in the process of recalculating the specific
market charges impacted, for this period.

Actual retro-active UFE adjustments will commence on July 3, 2000, and be
applied initially to the May 9th Preliminary Settlement Statement (PSS). The
ISO's intention is to correct 15 settlement days per week over the next 10
weeks until the entire 1999 August 21-December 31 period settlements are
corrected.  The ISO Settlements system time required to rerun settlements
constrains our ability to proceed more expeditiously.  However, we do plan
completion by the end of Summer.


The ISO will apply retroactive adjustments to ALL UFE related Market
charges. The erroneous UFE identified by the ISO UFE Project will be charged
to the responsible Scheduling Coordinators (SCs), to help assure that no
adverse market impact occurs from cost shifting.  Other SCs will receive the
associated charge type credits.



FINAL REPORT TO MARKET PARTICIPANTS - Fall 1999 ISO UFE PROJECT

On August 21, 1999, UFE in the PG&E Service Area increased substantially,
ranging from 4-15 %.   This inordinately high UFE continued in excess of
typical amounts of UFE for this UDC Service Area (-1 to +1%), for four
months.

The ISO actively investigated potential systemic causes for this order of
magnitude increase in UFE.

ISO efforts consisted of a concerted review of SQMD submitted by SC's during
this period, a review of the ISO MDAS polled meter data for ISO metered
entities, a review of interchange data (exports), a review of the
Transmission Loss calculations used by ISO Settlements to calculate UFE by
UDC, an investigation of the Market Redesign Settlements software changes
associated with the drop of new Settlements software in mid- August and the
retention of a data consultant to help identify and isolate any causal
factor, attributable for the high UFE .


The effort to identify UFE related settlement issues for the period of
August 21, 1999 through December 31, 1999 is complete.  The ISO UFE Project
team, working in conjunction with Market Participants, identified over 1.1
million MWH of erroneous UFE. This UFE is now accounted for, and will be
reassigned to the responsible SCs. The ISO Project identified over 14 casual
sources of UFE during this period.  Many of the issues identified were
interrelated.

The last major source of UFE for the period was identified in April. This
UFE resulted from an erroneous Validation, Editing and Estimating (VEE)
factor, applied to firm load within the PG&E Service Area.  This error,
associated with late or missed meter data adjustment, commenced October 1,
1999 and resulted in understated SC load of approximately 100 - 267 MW/hour,
through December.

The balance of the SC meter data management errors previously identified
were attributable to the complexity of using Pseudo Resources and Logical
Metering to model, schedule and settle Municipal UDC existing contracts
(ETCs).

The four primary SCs which experienced meter data problems, within the PG&E
UDC Service Area, have resubmitted corrected Settlement Quality Meter Data
(SQMD).

The ISO will initiate retroactive UFE Market adjustments for the Settlement
period of August 21,1999 through December 31, 1999.  The magnitude of the
Market UFE adjustment is approximately $70 million. These retro-active
Market adjustments will complete the Project Team's work on the Fall 1999
UFE issue.


Present UFE Status:

March 2000 UFE, based upon Final Settlement Statements (FSS), is as follows:

System UFE         +
0.22 %
PG&E UDC Service Area UFE   + 0.17 %
SCE UDC Service Area UFE    + 0.44 %
SDG&E UDC Service Area UFE   -  0.45%

  Market Participants:

  At the June 8 Congestion Reform Stakeholder meeting, we
discussed the possibility of a meeting on June 20 to address locational
market power mitigation.  We will not hold such a meeting on June 20th.
However, we  are working on a comprehensive project schedule and plan to
have it to you by the end of this week. That schedule should cover meetings
on Congestion Management for June, July, August and early September.

  Market Participants and Scheduling Coordinators:

  The ISO has obtained an extension of time to comply with the
CPUC subpoena received by fax yesterday evening, and by hard copy this
morning. A copy of the subpoena will be posted on the web site tomorrow.
The ISO is required to respond by Friday July 28. The CPUC is considering
requests for confidential treatment. In accordance with the ISO tariff,
Market Participants should at their own discretion and cost take steps to
obtain confidential treatment for data and should inform the ISO so that the
ISO can comply with its responsibility to support their efforts.

  Questions on this matter should be directed to Jeanne Sole
at (916) 608-7144.

  The ISO did respond to the EOB subpoena today.

  Market Participants:
  The CAISO has posted its draft Congestion Management Reform
(CMR) recommendation on its web site at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html
<http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html> . This document
recommends changes to the CAISO's current Congestion Management process and
related features of its business practices and operations. This is a draft
document, albeit one that we believe reflects significant effort and thought
on the part of both the stakeholders who provided the initial input and the
interdisciplinary design team that drafted this document.
  This CMR recommendation represents an essential milestone in
the broader Congestion Management Reform Project.  The first stage involved
soliciting stakeholder input regarding the problems to be solved,
alternative solutions to address these problems, and criteria for evaluating
reform proposals. The second stage involved the CAISO's crafting an
integrated, internally consistent reform package utilizing the ideas
developed with and/or by Stakeholders in stage one. This document contains
the CAISO's draft recommendation. We emphasize that, although we believe
this recommendation package to be a necessary milestone in the Congestion
Management Reform Project, it is not intended to predispose the final
design. We are actively soliciting Stakeholders' comments and critiques
concerning this recommendation over the coming weeks (stage three of the CMR
project).
  Once the next round of stakeholder input has been assessed,
the CAISO will revise this CMR recommendation. The revised recommendation
will be presented to the CAISO Governing Board for discussion and review
only on August 1 (no Board action requested). The CMR recommendation will
continue to be developed through August and the final recommendation will be
submitted to the CAISO Governing Board for approval at the September 6th and
7th meeting.  The approved CMR recommendation will be prepared (in
conjunction with Stakeholders) for the final Tariff filing to FERC in
November (stage four). A revised, detailed calendar will be presented at the
CMR Stakeholder meetings on July 13 and 14.
  At the July 13 and 14 Stakeholder meetings, the CAISO will
present the entire recommendation, section-by-section and provide the
opportunity for Stakeholders to clarify their understanding of what is being
proposed. Shortly thereafter, we will hold additional Stakeholder meetings
to facilitate detailed discussion of individual elements of the
recommendation. Additional meeting dates will be discussed on July 14 at the
meeting.
  We look forward to reviewing this proposal with you and
receiving your comments. The CAISO welcomes any and all comments and
critiques of this recommendation. We appreciate your attention and efforts
in this endeavor to reform the Congestion Management process.

Below is a summary of my SWPTF, CAISO and SW IOU's meeting 10 days ago.  The 
meeting was very positive and it looks like we are getting traction on 
getting the SW IOU's to join the CAISO as an option to continuing with DSTAR.

Subject: Update on Discussions between CAISO and DSW Parties


The purpose of this e-mail is to update the recipients on the status of
the discussions that have been taking place, between the CAISO and
Desert Southwest market participants and transmission owners, on the
possible merger of the California and Desert Southwest regions into a
single RTO.

On June 5, a meeting was held in Phoenix to discuss the terms under
which various parties would seriously consider a proposal for
consolidation of California and the DSW under a single RTO operated by
the CAISO.  This was the second meeting that was held to discuss this
idea.  Represented were the CAISO, APS, PNM, TEP, EPE, TNP, APSES,
NewEnergy, Enron, Calpine, PG&E Gen, Southern, Duke, Cal PX, and DOE.

The issues that were discussed included the CAISO's ability to implement
the major components of the DSTAR commercial model, the changes that
would need to be made in the CAISO's governance and internal structure,
and costs.

The parties at the meeting were generally in favor of:  (i)
consolidating the existing control areas into a single control area as
soon as possible, (ii) migrating to a common set of market protocols on
a fairly rapid basis, (iii) creating a single, independent, RTO
governing board with no bias in favor of either California or the Desert
Southwest region, and (iv) migrating from a regional advisory committee
structure to a single advisory committee structure as soon as possible,
to avoid balkanization and accelerate convergence.  Most parties felt
that there were, at this time, no "show-stoppers" on most of the issues.

For many of the participants, the most significant outstanding questions
were: (i) the costs (both $/MWh and cost shifts) that Desert Southwest
parties would incur under the consolidation scenario, and (ii) timing -
i.e., whether the necessary implementation, governance and
organizational changes could be put into place by a target date of June
2001.

It was agreed that the next step was for the CAISO, working with
interested parties, to provide a tentative implementation cost (both
with and without consolidation of DSW control areas, but in both cases
with independent procurement and operation of ancillary services).

The agreed-upon Action Plan was as follows:

June 9: CAISO to develop list of questions which need to be answered to
enable it to develop a cost estimate

June 16: CAISO to respond to the list of questions generated at the June
5 meeting

June 16:  CAISO to be provided with responses to the CAISO's list of
questions

June 16: Transmission owners to provide to the CAISO their definition of
the scenario(s) that they desire the CAISO to consider in developing its
cost estimate

July 10: CAISO to provide cost estimate

July 20: Meeting in Phoenix to discuss the cost estimate, address any
additional questions, and discuss the viability and possible contents of
a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)

July 31:  Decision from all interested parties regarding their desire to
move forward

August 15: Assuming a positive outcome on July 31, meeting to discuss
finalization of an MOU which would address the commitments of the
parties, market structure, changes in governance, organizational goals,
priorities and structures, etc.

Status:  The first four items above are close to completion.   The CAISO
has sent a list of technical questions to Carl Imparato and he is
completing a response.  The CAISO is completing its response to the list
of questions it received on June 5.  The interested transmission owners
have defined the scenarios that they wish to see considered by the
CAISO.

When all of these documents are finalized, which I expect to occur in
the next 2-3 days, I will forward them to all of the addresses.

If you have any questions, please give call me at 510-558-1456.

It looks as though the budget language which would unwind the Commission's 
recent decision to allow competition with the Cal PX will be passed.  
Therefore, in the near term, the Cal PX is the only trading vehicle for the 
utilities.

Our lobbyists found NO support in the legislature to buck the language.  
Principally because the president of the Commission, Loretta Lynch, was the 
one seeking a legislative fix to unwind a decision that her agency issued.  
She had greased the skids with both the Republicans and the Democrats to 
support the language.  

So, as a result, the only thing that the Commission can do at this point is 
study the affects of introducing competition with the Cal PX and issue a 
report to the legislature by June 1, 2001.  Prior to that date, the 
Commission cannot implement any decision on this issue.  Effectively, by the 
time any change would occur, we could be at/or near the end of the transition 
period, when the mandatory buy/sell requirement would terminate.

We can encourage the Commission to study this issue and use the time as an 
opportunity to educate the Commission(ers) about Enron OnLine.  If there were 
perceptions that we would not qualify as an exchange, this would be a good 
time to dispel that bias.  Government Affairs would be happy to work with you 
in organizing such an event.

  Market Participants:

  The ISO has posted the following materials regarding CAISO's
Congestion Management Reform (CMR) Recommendation.

  Congestion Management Reform Recommendation (This is the
same as the version posted on July 11th with the exception that we have
corrected typographical errors.)

  Appendix A - Terminology and Acronyms A glossary of various
terms and acronyms used throughout the CMR Recommendation package.

  Appendix B - Locational Price Dispersion Study Summarizes
the areas of empirical study in which the ISO is currently engaged and
describes the objective, design, and preliminary results of the ISO's
analysis of the dispersion of locational prices throughout the ISO control
area.

  Appendix D - Assessment of CMR Design Recommendation with
Respect to Stakeholder Evaluation Criteria Compares the CMR Recommendation
against the specific evaluation criteria agreed to by the ISO and Market
Participants at the first stakeholder meetings.

  Appendix E - Congestion Management Redesign Options Not
Adopted in the CMR Recommendation

  Appendix G - System Impacts Summarizes the anticipated
impact of CMR Recommendation on the ISO's primary systems, such as SI/SA,
BBS, FTR, EMS, etc.  The purpose of this appendix is not to provide detailed
cost-benefit evaluation of the proposal, which we believe would be entirely
subjective and of little value.

  Appendix H - Intra-Zonal Congestion Management Mitigation
Costs During 1999  and Their Application to Local Reliability Areas.

  It is our intent to publicly distribute Appendix C, as
identified below, by mid August.  In the final draft of
  the recommendation package, to be publicly distributed and
provided to the Board in late August, we will
  provide the following additional appendices as well as
updated versions of those identified above.

  Appendix C - Market Separation Study The objectives, design,
and preliminary results of the other ongoing study being undertaken in
connection with the Congestion Management Reform process.

  Appendix F - Summary of Stakeholder Comments of California
ISO Congestion Management Proposals A summary of all stakeholder comments
received to date on the various proposals and concepts incorporated into
this recommendation package.

  You can find these Appendices along with the original
proposal and feedback form  at
http://www.caiso.com/clientserv/congestionreform.html.

Load is up in CA and so is the potential for selling load curtailment 
products to customers.


BOTTOMLINES:

PG&E has asked the CPUC to approve participation of E-19 and E-20 Direct 
Access customers in the ISO A/S load participation pilot program (filed June 
7).

SCE has asked the CPUC to approve that all customers on its Large Power 
Interruptible tariff can participate in the ISO A/S load participation pilot 
program (filed June 7).

FERC approved the ISO's Load Participation pilot progam and pricing on June 
14, 2000, calling it an innovative program.

This appears to be a total GREEN LIGHT for Enron to move forward with 
customers.


PROCESS:

The utilities filed advice letters.  Comments are due on June 27.  Unless you 
tell us otherwise, we plan to file and seek expedited treatment. (The CPUC 
has no required timetable in which to respond.)  We expect the CPUC to 
approve them -- there is pressure from many fronts to DO something about load 
participation in the market.  Both have asked for a July 17 effective date.


DETAILS:

SCE's is a much better document and makes a good case for CPUC approval, even 
though the the customers are already benefitting from providing the utilities 
with the option to curtail during system emergencies. SCE proposes the 
following approach to prevent "double-dipping" by the customers:  If the ISO 
directs SCE to activate its load curtailment program during the time period 
that the customer has an accepted bid from the ISO in the A/S market, SCE -- 
working with the ISO -- will adjust the customer's bill to avoid double 
payments.  SCE provides no more information, but, on principal, this seems 
fair to me.  We'll have to watch to see what the proposed procedure would be.

PG&E doesn't say much except that it is "unable" to offer this to bundled 
customers (oh, gee -- must be more of those "system constraints") until 
"later" (unspecified).  I would expect large customer groups to argue about 
that -- but it gives us the opportunity to push direct access.  PG&E didn't 
have much to offer on the "double-billing" issue -- it said either PG&E could 
change the customers bill or the ISO could adjust its payment.

FERC threw out all the protests by various parties (e.g., MWD, M-S-R, other 
munis) and approved the ISO's proposal.  The big issues were:  supposed 
improper allocation of demand relief program costs (ISO allocates it to all 
SCs based on metered demand during all hours of the program);q request to 
charge those who are out of balance for most of the costs; the need to file 
pro forma agreement in advance (FERC said ISO doesn't have to); and the 
supposed overly restrictive program participation. If you want to know more 
about the order, give me a call.

Have fun!

ISO Automated Dispatching System (ADS) Project Distribution List:

The ISO will host an "Automated Dispatching System Phase II" project kickoff
and informational working session on Thursday, August 24, 2000, from 9 AM
through Noon, at the Lake Natoma Inn, Folsom.  A Continental Breakfast will
be served.

Please RSVP to Colleen Grant, ISO Client Relations at 916-608- 7069 or
e-mail Cgrant@caiso.com .

Each Market Participant should send its designated principle contact or
liaison for this California ISO ADS Phase II project session.  As an
alternative, we will have a conference bridge open, number to follow.

The ISO ADS Project Phase II Management Team of Kristine Kelley and Greg
Ford will be introduced at this kickoff session.  We will also review the
ADS project history and progress to date, review business requirements and
functionality improvements for the next release of ADS, conduct a Q & A
session, and receive Market Participant feedback on the project.

A preliminary project scope and detailed agenda will follow, by August 18.

Attached, for your information, are the slides from the ADS Phase II
presentation given at the August 9 MIF meeting.

 <<ADS MIF 0809.ppt>>
Thank you for your continued participation in the development of electronic
dispatch for the California ISO.  Implementation of the next version of ADS
is imperative to help assure efficient, accurate dispatch of Real Time
energy, and the associated notification, logging and energy settlement.

Tim/Bob:

Attached is the letter that we sent to Lynch explaining the info we thought 
ought to be made publicly available.  We're discussing how we can ensure that 
the market has access to any and all information that FERC might use in its 
"investigation" so that independent analyses might be undertaken.  Is there 
anything in addition to the information we included in the letter to Lynch 
(or that is already be publicly available) that FERC might use in its 
investigation and that we ought to target for public release?  Thanks alot.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: CA ISO / CAL PX Information Related to 2000 Market Activity

We need to come up (very quickly) with a strategy on how to get the market 
information that will be important for FERC Investigation into the public 
arena.

I keep thinking that FERC can require the information and somehow get it made 
public right away.  

1. What information is not public that would be helpful?

2. What strategy will work to get FERC to take action?

Jim

> participation in the ISO's Ancillary Services and Supplemental Energy
> markets by additional Participating Loads.  The ISO proposed to
> accommodate such participation from June 15 to October 15, 2000 by Loads
> that could provide telemetry of their Demand data to the ISO's Energy
> Management System pursuant to a "relaxed" Technical Standard.  The ISO
> indicated that it would accept proposals for up to the following amounts
> of capacity for bidding in the specified markets:
>
>      Non-Spinning Reserve:   400 MW
>      Replacement Reserve:   400 MW
>      Supplemental Energy: 1,000 MW
>
>    In response to that solicitation, the ISO received
> several proposals and has been working to implement participation by the
> respondents.  In the course of the implementation process, the ISO has
> determined that the actual amounts of capacity that will potentially be
> available to participate will be below the maximum for any of the listed
> services.  Approximately half of the 400 MW in Non-Spin and Replacement
> has been committed (some subject to CPUC approval) leaving approximately
> 200 MW available in each category.  Approximately 750 MW is still
> available in the Supplemental Energy category.
>
>    Therefore, the ISO wishes to announce a re-opening

UPDATE ON INTER-SC TRADES ADJUSTMENT BID PROJECT TIMELINE
Market Participants:

Market Participants, through TSWG,  have expressed concern about the
currently scheduled release time between 10 minute settlements and Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid functionality.  As a result of the delay to
implementation of 10 minute settlements, the release time frame has
decreased from the original 1 month to approximately 2 weeks.  Understanding
these timing concerns, the ISO has decided to delay the implementation of
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid.

Therefore, the ISO is revising the implementation target date for Inter-SC
Trade Adjustment Bid until the first week of October 1, 2000.  Following is
an updated project timeline.

Prior to the ISO making this decision, feedback from both business and
technical sides of the Market Participants were taken into consideration.
It was determined that this later date will allow Market Participants
additional testing time to prepare for a successful implementation of the
Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid software.
