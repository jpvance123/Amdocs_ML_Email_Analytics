																				NEB  Releases Energy Market? Assessment 
																				
																				? ?The National Energy Board has released its  latest in a series of Energy 
Market Assessment? reports  entitled Canadian Natural Gas Market Dynamics and 
Pricing. The  report identifies the factors that affect natural gas prices 
and  describes the current functioning of the regional gas markets in  
Canada. The Board's report concludes that Canada has become part of  an 
integrated North American natural gas market. Natural gas can be  bought from 
many supply sources and delivered to any market centre  through an extensive 
North American pipeline grid. With the  increased integration of the markets, 
regional supply and demand  forces are felt throughout the marketplace. It 
also says that a  combination of strong economic growth in North America, a 
preference  for natural gas fired electricity generation, and low natural 
gas  prices led to sustained growth in demand throughout the 1990s.  However, 
the growth in natural gas supply has lagged during the last  few 
																				
																				
																				
																				
																				
																																									
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	
																																	years. This is primarily attributable to the low oil price  environment of 
1997/1998 which reduced cash flow for the producing  sector. In turn, 
drilling activity decreased throughout North  America. Since demand growth 
has outpaced supply growth, natural gas  prices have increased significantly 
over the last year. With oil  prices recovering sharply in 1999/2000, the 
producing sector has  responded and drilling activity is at high levels. 
Despite the  drilling activity, there is a lag between developing additional 
gas  supplies and connecting those supplies to the market. In time, there  
will be a supply and demand response and accompanying relief in  natural gas 
prices is expected. A period of market adjustment is  necessary any time the 
dynamic between supply, transportation and  demand is significantly changed. 
It is difficult, if not impossible,  to predict with certainty any movements 
in the commodity markets.  The Report found that recent increases in the 
commodity

																									Concamin to Propose NewRegulated Natural Gas Price  Scheme
																									
																									? ? 
																									? ?  Leading Mexican business association, Concamin, will propose that  Pemex 
adopt a new scheme for determining the price of natural gas.  The details of 
the proposal were finalized at a Tuesday night  meeting of Concamin's Energy 
Committee. Pemex currently uses the  price of gas in southern Texas as a 
price of reference in setting  the price of natural gas in Mexico. Under the 
scheme to be proposed  by Concamin, the price of natural gas would be 
determined with  reference to the costs of extraction, exploration, supply 
and  distribution, plus a reasonable profit margin for Pemex.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 th=
ey=20
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a=20
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associat=
ed=20
with an EOL trade.

Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large=20
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. Th=
is=20
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest=
=20
transaction conducted to date on EOL.

STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim=20
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial=
=20
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed wi=
th=20
customers.

Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the stee=
l=20
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The=
=20
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicaliti=
es=20
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent=20
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved acces=
s=20
to capital.

The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial=20
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel=20
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS

Nelson,
As you know, Grand Cheniere was under maintenance in October and we had to 
shut in Johson Bayou.   Francis wants us to reallocate (trespass gas) that 
they continued to flow onto ANR in the amout of  54,536mm to us  at an agreed 
upon price of $5.20.   ANR has agreed to do this next week.  Since you are 
out today Francis asked us to make sure you called him about this as well as 
another issue.  
Mark

Bill,

The VR 375 A-1D gas well is currently producing 5.2 Mmcfd.  This well is
very sensitive to ANR system pressure so be prepared for daily fluctuations.
The VR 375 A-1 oil well should come online today (11/2/00).  We will
transmit updates as they become available.

Tom

Mark Schrab -  

???????We received a call today from Petroquest demanding we increase our 
nominations to stay in balance. I have been forwarding you noms daily but PQ 
says you are not changing your nom with ANR.  

??????We (SEC and Cheyenne) are 9,600 mmbtu behind on a month to date basis. 
Please increase our nomination immediately and stay on top of it. As I sent 
you earlier today, current volumes are over 14,000 mmbtu/day which generates 
11,900 mmbtu/day for our share on a current basis. The addition of 9600 over 
20 days adds 480/day for a total nom of 12,380 mmbtu/day (SEC/Cheyenne) 
subject to daily change of production.

Please join me in congratulating Paul Quilkey in his new role as Vice 
President leading our efforts in Australia.  Joe Hirl has assumed a leading 
role in the formation of our business in Japan.  Joe also has regional 
responsibility for trading activity.

Paul's appointment is in recognition of the critical role Paul has played in 
Enron Australia's successful commencement and the body of outstanding work he 
has accumulated to date in his career with Enron. It is worth noting that 
Paul joined Enron as recently as the Associate intake of 1995.  In the short 
time since then Paul has developed and grown through various positions to his 
current Trading and Origination role, a position of great responsibility in a 
dynamic young business making aggressive inroads into the Australian market, 
and far from Enron's traditional US markets. 

Please join me in congratulating Paul on his appointment. 

Rebecca

																							? ?  The price of natural gas established for November in Mexico is down  16% 
from October, having been set at $4.31 per MMBtu as against  October's price 
of $5.11 per MMBtu, according to the CRE. The  decrease is the largest 
monthly fall in the price of natural gas so  far this year and leaves the 
price at a level comparable to that of  six months ago, the CRE said.

The SITARA system was brought down Monday night (12/4/00) for 4 hours for  
required maintenance.

This additional maintenance time as well as the normal nightly processing may 
delay the availability
of some portfolios early Tuesday morning. 

 The expected time for completion of priming portfolios for Tuesday is 
between 6:30 and 7:00 AM.

CPR will be available during this time.

Please call the SITARA/CPR Hotline ((713)-853-7049) if you have any questions 
or concerns.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

																													Alberta's Oil and Natural? Gas Revenue Doubles  
																													
																													
																													
																													?  ? Alberta's revenue from oil and natural gas will more than  double this 
year to about C$8.7 billion. It will use most of the  money to cut its debt. 
Alberta, the biggest international supplier  of natural gas to the US, will 
pay down its debt by C$4.5 billion  this year and give residents C$485 
million in tax and energy-bill  rebates. Alberta is expecting a C$4.2 billion 
budget surplus in the  fiscal year ending March 31. Alberta collects a 
percentage of  revenue from oil and natural gas produced in the province. 
The  province's debt, now around C$12.5 billion, rose when prices were  low. 
Alberta's low debt and its repayment program have earned it the  highest 
credit rating of any Canadian province.

																														Canadian 88 Losses Increase
																														
																														? 
																														
																														?  ? Canadian 88 Energy, which has put itself up for sale, says  its third 
quarter loss widened seven-fold because of production  problems and an 
ill-fated natural gas hedging program. It reported  the loss grew to C$5.2 
million. Cash flow, a key indicator a firm's  ability to fund future 
exploration, fell 64% to C$2.3 million from  C$6.4 million. The third quarter 
results reflected the one-time  impact of the upgrading program at the Olds 
Gas Plant, which  shut-in? 26 MMcf per day of natural gas and 770 barrels of  
liquids daily from September 5th until October 7th. Most Canadian  firms have 
been big winners in the natural gas market, but not  Canadian 88, whose 
natural gas hedging reduced cash flow by $26  million in the quarter.

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20
recommendation to appoint Jeff Skilling as chief executive officer, effecti=
ve=20
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will al=

retain his duties as president and chief operating officer.  I will continu=
e=20
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the=
=20
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for=
=20
the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for =
a=20
somewhat different role.

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=
nd=20
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20
continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look=
=20
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=

shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Announcing Initiatives to Increase Domestic Energy Production
The Director of the Minerals Management Service, Walt Rosenbusch, announced=
=20
today several initiatives to increase domestic natural gas and oil producti=
on=20
to meet the nation=01,s energy needs. These initiatives are proposed for th=
e=20
next offshore oil and gas lease sale in the Central Gulf of Mexico schedule=
d=20
for March 28, 2001. The announcement came as part of the issuance of a=20
proposed notice of sale for Sale 178 in today=01,s Federal Register.
MMS designed two of these initiatives specifically to spur domestic natural=
=20
gas production during the years 2004-2006. Director Rosenbusch called the=
=20
changes "strong initiatives on the part of the MMS to deal with the large=
=20
projected increase in gas demand for the nation. Several studies, including=
=20
the report issued by the National Petroleum Council, indicate that the=20
nation's demand for natural gas will grow from the current 22 trillion cubi=
c=20
feet (TCF) of gas to 29 TCF of gas in 2010. These initiatives may contribut=
e=20
additional gas production, in the range of 500 billion to 1 TCF per year in=
=20
the period 2004 to 2006."
Rosenbusch noted that "there are predictions of serious shortages of natura=
l=20
gas this winter, including the northeast U.S. There have already been sever=
al=20
brownouts across the country this year because of the demands on electrical=
=20
production."
Included in the proposed notice are two initiatives for increasing natural=
=20
gas production:
? An incentive to drill for deep gas deposits located in the shallow-water=
=20
shelf area of the Gulf of Mexico by providing for royalty suspension for th=
e=20
first 20 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of production from a well drilled below=
=20
15,000 feet sea level.=20
? An incentive to drill for natural gas below the thick subsalt domes. MMS=
=20
proposes that lessees obtain a 2-year extension of the 5-year primary lease=
=20
term when an operator has drilled a first subsalt well and needs additional=
=20
time to image the subsurface data to determine the appropriate next drillin=
g=20

in exploration.=20
In addition, MMS proposes modified initiatives for deep water royalty relie=
f:
? An incentive to keep exploring and developing oil and gas deposits in the=

ultra deepwater areas to replace the expiring provisions of the 1995=20
Deepwater Royalty Relief Act. A royalty suspension volume of nine million=

barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) is proposed for water depths from 800 meter=
s=20
to 1,599 meters, and a royalty suspension volume of the first 12 million BO=
E=20
in water depths equal to or greater than 1,600 meters.=20
? An opportunity to apply for additional "discretionary" royalty relief,=20
pursuant to new proposed rulemaking, if certain conditions are satisfied.=
=20
MMS will conduct public workshops to discuss the new provisions announced i=
n=20
the proposed notice of sale, as well as provisions of the proposed rule (65=

FR 69259 published November 16), regarding discretionary royalty relief for=
=20
leases in water depths of 200 meters and greater. Details about the worksho=
ps=20
that will be held this December in New Orleans and Houston will be released=
=20
today.
Proposed Sale 178 encompasses about 4,366 available blocks in the Central=
=20
Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf planning area offshore Louisiana,=20
Mississippi, and Alabama. This area covers about 23.07 million acres. Block=
s=20
in this sale are located from three to 200 miles offshore in water depths=

ranging from four to more than 3,425 meters. Estimates of undiscovered=20

as a result of this sale proposal range from 150 to 440 million barrels of=

Please refrain from running reports on the EnronOnline databases between 7 am 
- 2 pm CST / 1pm - 8pm GMT, which is our peak usage period.

These reports slow down EnronOnline trading.

We will have a solution to this problem within the next few weeks, but in the 
meantime, we appreciate your cooperation with the above.

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

Please see the following instructions for the new messenging board.  If you 
have any trouble entering into this site, please let me know.  Everyone 
should now be setup and ready to go. You will have to add this site to one of 
your favorites.  

The Gas Message Board application can run on both IE5.0 and IE5.5 now. 

Attached is the URL for user to run the application.

http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com

Please feel free to forward above URL to people who like to test the 
application. 

Here is the steps they should do:

1) Launch Internet Explorer

2) Type: http://gasmsgboard.dev.corp.enron.com (or just open this email and 
click on above URL)

3) Users should see the messages if there is any new messages for today. If 
they don't see any messages, there are two reasons: 
 (1) They are not valid users. Their names have not been added into the NT 
Web_GasTraders Group yet. Please contact Chrysti Hardy to add their names 
into the group.
 (2) There is no new messages added yet.

4) Click on "Comments" button to add messages: there will be a popup window 
when user clicks on "comments" button. There are two ways to send the 
messages after typing the 
messages into the text box:
 (1) just simply press enter to send the message. or
 (2) click on "send" button to send the message.

5) After the message has been sent, The message will be displayed on the main 
window immediately, the rest people who are online will get the new message 
in less than 30 seconds. This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. 
However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 
second.  Because each time the browser refreshes the screen, the screen will 
be blink. Users don't want the screen blink every second while they read the 
messages.

6) All messages will be cleaned up daily at 6:00PM. If they like to clean 
them up later than 6:00PM, please let me know. I can reset the time.

Note: Right now the application is under test environment. If they like it, I 
will move it into production environment soon.

Let me know any feedbacks.

Thanks,

Fangming

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

Bill: 
We had to wait until ANR completed their Cash Out Prices for November.   It 
was finally  posted in GEMS ANR's system and we will now enter it into system 
in order for you to get payment.    Tom Donohoe agrees to pay gas daily up to 
our imbalance which is 35,613 MM and ANR's Cash Out price for any volume over 
that.   We also had to wait a few days after the end of the month to get a 
correct allocation for the well; ANR is about 2 days behind on any given 
day.  
Thanks,
Mark

																											New  Pipeline Interconnection to Offer Canadian Supply
																											
																											
																											
																											?  ? Empire State Pipeline and the National Fuel Gas have  completed a new 
Canadian pipeline interconnection at Pendleton, NY,  allowing natural gas to 
flow to the US from Canada. The volumes from  Canada could flow to the 
Buffalo area market as well as to NFG's  interconnects with Tennessee Gas 
Pipeline in East Aurora, NY and  Ellisburg, PA; Dominion Transmission in 
Ellisburg; and  Transcontinental Pipeline and TETCO at Leidy. Empire Pipeline 
is  owned by ANR and Westcoast Energy's St. Clair Pipelines. ANR  Pipeline 
serves as the physical operator for Empire Pipeline, which  extends for about 
156 miles from Buffalo to Syracuse. Most of the  natural gas will come from 
Western Canada, and the new pipeline will  give more flexibility and supply 
options for Empire's shippers.

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=

service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=

scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=

																									Governments Negotiate Differences in The  Hague
																									
																									? ? 
																									After a week  of preliminary talks that failed to resolve differences over 
how  best to protect the planet, government leaders have arrived to  bargain 
over the toughest aspects of curbing emissions. About 2,000  lower level 
officials did what they could to prepare for the final  week of negotiations 
among environment ministers or cabinet-rank  officers from at least 150 
countries. The US feels its effort to  find common ground and be flexible has 
not been returned by?  European counterparts. The US has been singled out for 
criticism for  its effort to reduce its commitments. The government 
essentially  agreed to Kyoto because they agreed to the flexibility 
mechanisms  such as emissions trading, now the US is running into trouble 
with  that. If the conference ends in agreement, any treaty enforcing a  new 
global code of behavior on emissions will require ratification  by most of 
the industrial countries. Without a US endorsement, it  would be difficult 
for such a treaty to come into force. The US  Senate already has passed a 
resolution making its ratification  conditional on assurances that the 
nation's competitiveness on world  markets will not be harmed. A select group 
of leading policy makers  held informal closed-door talks in The Hague ahead 
of a ceremony  Monday marking the start of the critical second phase of the  
conference. The politicians are working toward a comprehensive plan  to 
reduce the Earth's output of heat-trapping gasses from  businesses, farms and 
automobiles, without bloating national budgets  or hampering the global 
economy. A board of 2,000 leading  scientists, the Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, projects  that in the coming 100 years there will be more 
rainfall, a  temperature increase of up to 11 degrees Fahrenheit and a 
sea-level  rise of up to 30 inches. An agreement reached in 1997 in Kyoto,  
Japan, called for a worldwide reduction of carbon-based gas  emissions by an 
average 5.2% below 1990 levels. The target date for  the reductions was 2012. 
Europe is committed to cutting emissions  8%, Japan 6% and the US 7%.

never  articulated clearly a requirement that a party exercising a  
contractual termination right must demonstrate that termination is  
consistent with the public interest, according to Dynegy. It also  argued 
that it has not refused to participate in an RTO; it merely  seeks to join 
one that adequately protects its legitimate financial  interests and also 
represents a significant improvement to the  status quo for other market 
participants. Dynegy urged FERC to limit  its decision on whether or not the 
company can leave the ISO to the  facts, not on the uproar Dynegy's actions

EnergyGateway.com Allows Producers Variable Levels of  Service Online? 

? ?
? ?  EnergyGateway.com, an  e-community that offers customized energy 
transactions among  suppliers and consumers, has announced a new program that 
will allow  natural gas producers to transact online under variable or  
interruptible levels of service in addition to firm service  specifications. 
EnergyGateway.com lets the producer choose its level  of service when the 
offer is made, including swing, interruptible  and firm service. This lets 
buyers and sellers transact for any term  and is not simply a day-trading 
tool. Allowing more producers to  compete online can only add to the 
transaction savings achieved by  participants. To create an optimum portal 
for buyers and sellers, we  must have direct contact with the producer 
community in order to  meet the needs of our customers. This program can 
provide a service  to producers in any region of the

Cabre to Sell Shallow Natural Gas Area

? ? 
Canada's Cabre  Exploration has agreed to sell its northeastern Alberta

on 22,400 gross acres of oil sands leases. The area  represents 25% of its 
current production. Cabre is considering  either a share buyback or dividend 
with the proceeds.

Since Bruce Ferrel, the designated system administrator for Enron, is no
longer with your company I am addressing this issue to you. We obviously
need to change the administrator of the system as soon as possible. In
addition, I have sent over the new appendix's we spoke about yesterday to
your attention.
Today we had a situation where Dick Jenkins (Enron employee)hit a flat GDD
bid at Transco Z-6 for Dec 2000. He actually was logged in under Scott
Hendrickson's ID. Soon after the trade occurred, Mr. Jenkins called and
informed me that he had made a mistake and that he wanted the deal
cancelled. I informed him of the Manifest Error penalty associated with that
step. By the way the penalty associated with a manifest is $15,000. Mr.
Jenkins informed me that he wanted the trade cancelled but would not pay the
fee.
The Amendment to the Subscription Agreement dated June 23, 1999 describes
the Manifest Error process and all fees associated with it. Altra enforces
this language on all subscribers to the system in order to ensure the
integrity of our trading platform.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713-210-8278.


Sincerely,
Scott Coleman

Subject: Erroneous Messages sent by Andrew Wu/HOU/EES on Wednesday, October 
25th

On Wednesday, October 25, at approximately 7 p.m. CST, you may have received 
e-mail messages which appear to have been sent from Andrew Wu/HOU/EES.  These 
e-mails were generated as the result of an erroneous messaging agent which 
originated on the EES mail system.  The overall effect of the messaging agent 
allowed the "auto-reply" of all messages within Andrew Wu's mail file, many 
which included the Global Distribution group of "Enron Worldwide".  The Enron 
Global Messaging group alerted EES Mail Administration to the event and were 
successful in disabling the "auto-reply" agent rather quickly, however, 
numerous mail messages had already been delivered to your server mailbox.  If 
you received any of these messages, please delete them and do not reply back 
to Andrew Wu regarding the receipt of the messages.  

We apologize for the inconvenience that this may have caused you and will 
strive to ensure that a similar incident does not occur in the future.


Thanks,
Enron Global Messaging Team

Ladies and Gentlemen,

We plan to upgrade the two NT servers that run Gas TDS's middle-tier 
applications this weekend.  Therefore, TDS will not be available between 
12:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, December 10th, 2000.  If this downtime is 
in conflict with your schedule, please let me know ASAP.

I would also like to point out to you that when TDS is brought back on line, 
it will be necessary for all the desks to be reloaded.  Since we introduced 
the TDS Flag last month, this should not effect any of the desks.

Thank you for your cooperations,
Kenny H.

																																	Consultant Says Mexico to Pay Billions for Natural Gas  
																																	
																																	
																																	? ?  Mexico, over the next decade, will likely need to spend $40.6  Billion 
to import natural gas, given Pemex's failure to conduct  adequate capital 
investment, consultants Consultores Internacionales  have said in a report. 
The estimate assumes an average price for  natural gas of $4.50 per MMBtu 
over the period. In a more  conservative scenario, with the average price of 
natural gas at  $3.50 per MMBtu, the country over the next 10 years would 
need to  spend $31.6 billion dollars on natural gas imports, according to 
the  report. Under both scenarios, estimates expect that Mexico will need  to 
import 24.7 Bcf of natural gas during the coming decade.

																																				September Canadian Natural Gas Sales
																																				
																																				
																																				Natural gas sales totaled 4.22 billion cubic meters in  September, up 10.2% 
over September 1999. The increase was the result  of increased demand by the 
industrial and residential sectors. Use  by the industrial sector rose 11.7%, 
amid higher use of natural gas  for electricity generation and stronger 
demand by the chemical  industry. Year-to-date sales were up 7.1% over the 
same period in  1999. Industrial sector sales continued to grow strongly, 
posting an  11.1% increase. Consumption by the residential sector increased 
1%,  while the commercial sector decreased 1.1%.

This is to request that Spinnaker's nomination for the VR 375 well(s) be
lowered from the current nom of 11,728 mmbtu to 7443 mmbtu, effective start
of day on 11/21/00.

The reduction is necessary as a result of the SI of the well on Friday,
11/17/00, through the current time, Monday, 11/20/00, combined with shut-ins
that occurred on 11/13 and 11/14.

This nomination volume is based on an assumed rate of 12,700 through the end
of the month.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this request.

																														NYMEX to Launch Online Trading Next Spring
																														
																														
																														
																														?  The NYMEX plans to launch its online trading platform, enymex, in  the 
second quarter of next year. The system will trade and clear  forward 
contracts for physical commodities such as crude oil,  refined products, 
natural gas, electricity and metals. It will  compete with existing ventures 
such as IntercontinentalExchange and  HoustonStreet. Enymex was originally 
set to start in the third  quarter of this year. NYMEX had been in talks on 
joining ICE before  deciding to go it alone.

																					US  Negotiates at Climate Meeting 
																					
																					
																					? ?  At the UN conference in the Hague, environmental groups are accusing  
the US of seeking loopholes to avoid cutting pollution. The  conference 
opened to set rules for reducing harmful gases released  into the atmosphere. 
One major issue revolved around how much  countries could trade off against 
their commitments to roll back  their own pollution by helping other 
countries reduce theirs or by  planting new forests to absorb greenhouse 
gases. The US advocates  unlimited emissions trading, but the EU and some 
developing  countries fear it will defeat the effort to force the biggest  
polluters to change their ways. The US argues that emissions trading  is the 
most cost-effective way to meet the global target of reducing  greenhouse 
gases by 5.2% from 1990 levels, and would give time for  the transition to 
cleaner energy and expensive new technologies.  About 6,000 bureaucrats, 
scientists, environmentalists and  businessmen attended the opening. That 
number was expected to grow  to 10,000 during the second week with the 
arrival of 100 government  ministers for the culmination of negotiations. 
Months of talks have  preceded the conference. Three years ago at Kyoto, 
governments drew  up targets for rolling back emissions of carbon-based gases 
but  could not agree on the details. Europe agreed to cut emissions by  8%, 
the US by 7% and Japan by 6%. Each was allowed to decide how it  would make 
the required reductions. So far, 30 countries have  ratified the Kyoto 
Protocol. Mexico is the most industrialized  country on the list, and none is 
among the heaviest polluting  countries. The agreement needs the ratification 
of 55 countries,  representing at least 55% of the harmful emissions, before 
it will  come into force.

																									?  ? ?Allegheny Energy plans to buy three natural gas fired  power plants in 
the Midwest from Enron. Terms have not been  disclosed. The plants, which 
opened in June, are in Wheatland, IN;  Manhattan, IL; and Gleason, TN. They 
can generate a total of 1,710  MW of electricity. Allegheny plans to pay for 
the plants with stock  and debt. The purchase is expected to close in the

???????We received a call today from Petroquest demanding we increase our 
nominations to stay in balance. I have been forwarding you noms daily but PQ 
says you are not changing your nom with ANR.  

??????We (SEC and Cheyenne) are 9,600 mmbtu behind on a month to date basis. 
Please increase our nomination immediately and stay on top of it. As I sent 
you earlier today, current volumes are over 14,000 mmbtu/day which generates 
11,900 mmbtu/day for our share on a current basis. The addition of 9600 over 
20 days adds 480/day for a total nom of 12,380 mmbtu/day (SEC/Cheyenne) 
subject to daily change of production.

																Total to Build Deep-Water Gulf of 
																Mexico Gathering System
																
																
																? ? TotalFinaElf plans to construct a natural gas  gathering project with its 
north American partners in the Gulf of  Mexico, enabling the development of 
three deep offshore natural gas  fields. The project consisted of a 56-mile 
pipeline with a  transmission capacity of 500 MMcf per day and a processing 
platform,  owned and operated by Williams.? Construction of the Canyon  
Express pipeline, in the Mississippi Canyon area about 120 miles  southeast 
of New Orleans, will begin next year. The gathering system  will begin 
operating in summer 2002, at the same time as the three  natural gas fields, 
Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden Hills. Canyon  Express was a major 
technological breakthrough for TotalFinaElf,  making it possible to undertake 
oil and natural gas operations at  previously untapped depths of over 6,000 
feet. The gas gathering  system will be operated by Elf Exploration and 
belong to the  companies who owned the Aconcagua, King's Peak and Camden 
Hills  fields. Aconcagua is operated by Elf Exploration which has a 50%  
stake in the field. Enron affiliate, Mariner Energy, and Pioneer  Natural 
Resources each own 25%. King's Peak is wholly-owned and  operated by BP

believe the potential reserves could exceed 100  Tcf. Currently, oil 
producers produce about 8 MMcf per day of  natural gas and re-inject almost 
all of it into oil reservoirs to  build up pressure there and enhance future

Effective November 21, 2000, there will be a new procedure for lunch.  EOL 
traders and deskheads will eat first.  Then, your assistant will notify you 
when the rest of the traders can eat.   This new procedure is to ensure the 
EOL traders will not be away from their desk a long period time during 
lunch.   

Thank you for your cooperation.

Tom:
I tried to leave you a message about what happened on the last cycle for gas 
day 9 but your voicemail at the office didn't work.; Grand Chenere compressor 
went down by 100,000MM in total late saturday night.  This affected 20,000 of 
supply coming from HIOS and 14,000 SE Transmission pool purchases.  I was 
able to make up 15,195 on the 10th. by increasing our HIOS nom and paying 
back PG&E.   ANR said the compressor is back up now however with shippers 
doing makeup this could cause more capacity cuts for the 12th.  I'll be back 
tomorrow, I've got jury duty today.  
W&T left me a messge at the office that they went down but they didn't page 
me so we were cut 2,982 at SS207 over the weekend;which also cut our SE Tran. 
markets.  I've taken them down to 1 unless you'd like to shut them in ( 
Deal498384).

Kirk- Shawn at Duke said he cut us at N.Maumee(ML7) by 1000, see if our Mkt. 
wants makeup for 12th.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

I would like to remind you that only postID of calcs that have TDS Flag (in 
Port Calc screen) set to "1" are included in TDS position load.  We have 
noticed that ST-Bammel, ST-Bridgeline, GD-Texas,... and many more desks do 
not have the TDS Flag set to "1".

Please call me (x30413) or Bill Kasemervisz (x57579) if you have any 
questions.

Kenny H.

Effective immediately, there is a change to the Stack Manager which will 
affect Inactive Children.

Inactive Children with links to Parent products will not have their 
calculated prices updated until the Child product is Activated.

When the Child Product is activated, the price will be recalculated and

Over the next several months Enron will be phasing in a new expense-reporti=
ng=20
product, Concur Technologies=01, Expense Management System (XMS).  You will=
 be=20
able to prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it=
=20
for payment using the Intranet.  It will be far more user-friendly than the=
=20
Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless=20
process.  In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP=20
accounting system. =20

On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded t=
o=20
the most current release.  On October 30, it will be available to Enron Cor=
p=20
employees, Company 0011.  The rollout to other groups will continue through=
=20
January 2001.  Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit.=20

In Houston, IT Central will provide four training sessions per week. To=20
enroll in a class go to itcentral.enron.com and click on=20
Services>Training>Schedules. Those in outlying locations and those who pref=
er=20
on-line training can use LEAP by signing on to sap.enron.com and clicking o=
n=20
Training, then LEAP.  Use xms (lower case) as the User ID and Password. =20

We are excited about this new system and hope you will find it useful.  If=

you have questions regarding its use contact IT Central at (713) 345-4727 o=
