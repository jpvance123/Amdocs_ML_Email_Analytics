This is the last email I have on the issue of consequentials/LOL.  As I 
recall, we have not agreed to the redaction of the carve out of the LOL for 
gross negligence, but it is an important issue for GE.  

Steve Swift wants to close out these issues.  Are we ready, or do we need 
this for a swap for something?

Folks,

Here is some language for discussion this afternoon.  Please note that this
is being submitted for discussion without full management approval; we're
getting so close to the bone that we'll probably need to take the final
package as a whole through our vetting process

I'm looking through the warranty section now, so perhaps we can discuss that
as well.

Ciao,


 Mike

Per the conference call of Wednesday, I revised Section 9.6 (with Scott 
fixing my drafting).  Attached document contains a redline of the section.

I think this can be included in the version that goes to GE.  I discussed the 
concept with Jim Sutherland- he agreed with relaxing the unilateral 
requirement in the case of GE.  We would not want to do this in the case of 
other vendors.

Hi there,

I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.

Here are some questions/comments:

I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations. =
=20
I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what=
=20
rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role o=
f=20
the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that=20
familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll wo=
rk=20
on it.=20

I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially=20
similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.

Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.

I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they=
=20
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.

I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=
he=20
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=
d=20
financials, but I didn't comment there.

I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20
own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20
"construct", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.

Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):



Except for as described in Section ___ [ next paragraph], neither Party sha=

I did not think the One-Train Contract had been signed.  If it has, we
should include it.  As I do not have a copy of either contract, I do not
know the answer to your question on GE's ability to ask for assurances
of performance.  I should be getting a copy today of the Two-Train
Contract and I will check.  I inserted the provision regarding Agent's
giving notice to GE of DevCo's default at Rose's request.

Rob, why isn't the Pastoria One-Train contract included (it has now been
signed I believe)?  If Agent were to give GE notice of Devco's default,
does GE have a rememdy under the turbine contracts to ask for collateral
or
accelerate the payment schedule?  I know that GE did not mention this in
our call.  What will Devco be able to do, just in case GE asks about
this?
Otherwise the draft l;ooks good and we await GE's comments.  The guay at
GE
to send this to by the way is Paul Miller@ps.ge.com.  Thanks!

As I mentioned on the call today, the assignment provision was not quite 
conformed - I left some redundant clauses in.  I have attached marked and 
clean old and new versions of Section 22 for your review and comment.

 Thanks and sorry for the inconvenience.

1.  Agree to delete reference to Enron Corp. guarantee.

2.  Agree that 22.3 probably not applicable in off-balance sheet projects but 
perhaps this language would apply in cases where this form contract is 
someday used outside of Enext.  Since GE has already agreed to it and since 
we are stuffing the Enext provisions into the override letter maybe we should 
keep 22.3 in the form contract.

The current form does not have the subcontract assignability language
and I agree that I am not sure we need 22.3.   Question to the team,
should I just put in the first part? Do we need language regarding an
Enron Corp. guarantee?

Subject: Old (Moldy by now) assignment language text.


Peter:

Below is assignment language that we used in our going master before we
entered into the era of the off balance sheet structures.  I do not
recall
whether we have the subcontract assignability language.  I question
whether
we need 22.3.


This  Agreement or any right or obligation contained herein may be
assigned
by Purchaser without Seller's consent to:

     (i)  an Affiliate;

     (ii)  a  Joint  Venture, Partnership, or other similar entity in
which
          Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Affiliate  is  a venturer, partner
or
          participant;

     (iii)     Owner;

     (iv) Lender; or

     (v)   to  any  entity  for  the  purposes  of financing or sale of
the
          Facility.

Except  for  (i)  through  (v)  above,  this  Agreement  may be assigned
by
Purchaser  to  other  parties only upon the prior written consent of
Seller
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  When duly assigned in
accordance
with the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to
the  benefit  of  the  assignee; any other assignment by Purchaser shall
be
void and without force or effect.

22.3     Agreement  with  Lender.   Seller  agrees  that  if  requested
by
Purchaser,  Seller  shall  enter  into a direct agreement with Lender
under
which Lender is permitted to "step into" this Agreement.

22.4    Assignment  of  Vendor  Agreements.  All Seller's subcontracts
with
Vendor  which  have  prices equal to or greater than $500,000 shall
include
provisions  giving  Seller  an  unrestricted  right  to assign the
relevant
subcontract  and  call  benefits,  interests,  rights  and  cause of
action
arising under it to Purchaser without Vendor's prior permission.

 <<List of Outstanding Issues for Completion of World Hunger Form
Agreement.DOC>>

 Attached is a list of outstanding issues/tasks for completion of
the World Hunger/GE Turbine Form Facility Agreement.  The list was
compiled based upon review of the notes I have taken during our
conference calls. There may be other issues/tasks that I have
overlooked.  I have only distributed this to you, but will gladly
circulate it to the remainder of the World Hunger team if you desire.

 What time is our call Wednesday?  Do we have a dial-in number?

As Sheila requested, I started with the GenPower language and worked in the 
"financial accommodation party" as one of the parties for whom Seller would 
not be "reasonable" in withholding its consent for Agent to assign.  I was 
not present during several discussions where the decision was made to go back 
to GE for consent on most assignments; I am assuming we want to keep the 
optics that we can assign in very few instances and are hanging our hats on 
the carve out  to the "reasonable to withhold" consent language.  

 I also deleted the requirement for a guaranty in certain instances.

Please respond ASAP with comments.  The first doc is the red-line, the second 
is the original GenPower language, third is the GenPower language with the 
two changes I mentioned above.  You may have to "view" the red-line - may not 
be able to "open" it.

Greetings,

I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more 
standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.  The goal is to 
develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the 
same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.  Sheila 
has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might 
find interesting and/or helpful.

You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.  Please 
let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.

Thank you,

Kay

 I think that I agree with the points and comments you folks raised in the
first echange on indemnities below, but don't have the document to refer
to. Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never
heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know
how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
"to the fullest extent permitted by law" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Subject:  GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)
(carve out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors,
ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely
and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its
subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers
simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that
we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence
of GE's subcontractors and vendors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase
price.
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another
party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call
to discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let
me know when, where, ect.

Kay


They should have to

 Pursuant to my voice mail message, attached please find a clean
copy of the current GE Form Agreement (second document below), as well
as a blackline (first document below) showing changes made to the
version circulated on March 19.  this version does not contain the
"Robust Scope" language in Section 7, nor does it make any significant
changes to Change orders (other than move what had been in Section 5.3
into that Article pursuant to one of our earlier conference calls.  I
have also not touched the takeover provision.  Chris can be reached at

I took a crack at tightening up the E Next assignment language as it exists 
in the overrides, for inclusion in WH form:



Peter, could you take first cut at the override letter?  We  may be having an 
internal meeting at 930 central, and if so, will you be available by phone if 
necessary?

Suz, please put the attachment in the notebook.

Subject: GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.  
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.  
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.  Kay 
- Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii) (carve 
out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors, ect.)?  
GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely and totally 
responsible for the actions and liabilities for its subcontractors and 
vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers simple negligence of GE's 
subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that we need to keep Section 
27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence of GE's subcontractors and 
vendors. 
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.  
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the 
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at 
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with 
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to 
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails 
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is 
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws, 
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase 
price.  
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.  
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity. 
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's 
claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call to 
discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let me 
know when, where, ect.

Kay

Folks,

Having conferred at last with my colleagues, I can now forward to you our
draft language for the Indemnity and LOL clauses.  As Steve mentioned in his
earlier message, he has suggested some issues to discuss which could bring
us closer to resolution on that issue.  Please let me know if you have any
question!

Best regards,

		 Subject: Variations- Change Orders- GE - impacts on manufacturing- Need your 
thoughts today .

One of the World Hunger issues is that GE does  not want Enron to be able to 
issue a unilateral change order which would impact the manufacturing schedule.

We have the same issue in the Arcos Power Island deal.  

Following is what I intend to propose to solve the Arcos problem and might 
work  for World Hunger:


" Purchaser acknowledges taht Seller's ability to accomodate changes in 
manufacturing scope in a timely or cost effective manner diminish as Seller 
gets further along into the manufacturing process, and after a point changes 
can only be made after assembly completion or in the field without adversely 
affecting Seller's manufacturing obligations to other clients (a "Client 
Impact").  Where such a Client Impact circumstance exists, Seller shall 
identify such constraints to Purchaser in its proposal submitted pursuant to 
Clause 17.2.(b) [time and cost estimate to accomodate the Change 
Order-Variation Order], which Purchaser shall take into account in evaluating 
Seller's proposed cost and time changes arising out of such Variation scope 
change. "




I would appreciate your thoughts as to whether this works for us in the World 
Hunger document-  I do  not want to propose for Arcos if it gives you great 
difficultly for World Hunger.

During one of the World Hunger calls a couple weeks ago I noted that the 
later half of Performance Liquidated Damage refund provision in Section 
10.9.8 was slighty  broken.   I volunteered to find what I thought it should 
look like.   In reviewing the Arcos contract I found the corresponding 
provision that seems to capture what I was concerned about.  I have included 
the ARCOS provision below for everyone's review.  Some of the defined terms 
do not match, but.....


14.18.2.2 If the corrections to reduce a Shortfall are completed before the 
Power Island achieves Acceptance and:
(i) such corrections are made and are complete prior to commercial operation 
of the Station, and
(ii) such corrections cause a reduction in the performance Shortfall
then Purchaser shall:
(a) refund to Seller an amount equal to the Performance Liquidated Damages 
associated with such reduction in the Shortfall, and/or 
(b) reduce the offset associated with such reduced Shortfall; however, such 
reduction in offset or amount of refund shall not exceed the amount actually 
offset (payment withheld) in accordance with Clause 30.8 or paid in 
accordance with Clause 14.15 for such Shortfall.
14.18.2.3 If the corrections to reduce a Shortfall are completed after the 
Power Island achieves Acceptance, and such corrections are completed within 
one hundred eighty (180) days after the Power Island achieved Acceptance, and 
such corrections cause a reduction in the performance Shortfall, then 
Purchaser shall:
(a) refund to Seller an amount equal to the Performance Liquidated Damages 
associated with such reduction in the Shortfall, and/or 
(b) reduce the offset associated with such reduced Shortfall;
however, such refund of Performance Liquidated Damages or reduction of offset 
will not exceed the amount actually offset in accordance with Clause 30.8 or 
paid in accordance with Clause 14.15 for such Shortfall and the amount of 
such refund or reduction of offset shall itself be reduced by the following 
amounts for each day that passes from date of the Performance Test on which 
the Performance Liquidated Damages were originally based upon until the date 
that Seller demonstrated the improved performance:
(c) At a rate of $0.23/day for each kW that the Net Electrical Output 
Shortfall of the Power Island is reduced (the "Output Liquidated Damages 
Refund Reduction").
(d) At a rate of $45.00/day for each kj/kWh that the Net Heat Rate Shortfall 
of the Power Island is reduced (the "Heat Rate Liquidated Damages Refund 
Reduction").
14.18.2.4 No refund of Performance Liquidated Damages shall be made if the 
corrections are made after one hundred eighty (180) days after Acceptance of 
the Power Island, unless Purchaser elects to do so as a result of the 
corrective action plan presented by Seller prior to the expiry of such one 
hundred eighty (180) day period.  In the event Seller determines the cause of 
a portion or all of the Shortfall prior to the expiry of the one hundred 
eighty (180) day period following Acceptance, but in spite of its reasonable 
efforts is not able to effect the necessary corrections to the Plant, Seller 
may present a correction plan that extends beyond such one hundred and eighty 
(180) day period. Purchaser, at its sole discretion, may elect to permit 
Seller the opportunity to make such corrections.

Attached is a draft of the SSEP standard packaging contract.  This is 
currently
being converted to our EDrafter Web-based format (The business person fills 
in a
database of information and populates the document, which is then sent to the
customer).  Our next phase in this process would actually be to make EDrafter
available to the customers for them to fill it in and work from it in a
ProjectNet extranet workroom environment.

Regardless of what document we end up with in our process, I think we should
consider a similar process for our "template document".  It would be efficient
for the business people (for example, the SSEP sales force can generate the
attached contract in about 10 minutes) and would free up legal time for both
parties.  Just food for thought.

Brian,

Attached is the exhibit list for the GE-Enron contracts.  What I have
attempted to do is list what exhibits I see that are finished and what ones
still require action.  All exhibits highlighted in yellow are closed from
GE's perspective. Please review the list and let me know if you agree with
the status at this point.  Once we do that we can figure out how best to
close up the other exhibits.

Thanks,

Steve Swift

Per our discussion yesterday, attached is a copy of the Indemnity and LOL 
contract language redlined to reflect those GE comments which we could 
probably accept.  Kay please review and see if I missed anything or whether 
we need to discuss further.  Otherwise, please forward this markup to Rob 
Taylor for inclusion in the next draft of the Purchase Agreement.

Hi there.

I am attaching for the group's consideration a red line that I ran comparing 
the current working draft (v4) with the draft John R. recently circulated to 
Tax and Insurance. 

I suggest that Pete Thompson keep the typewriter on this.  We are getting so 
close to the end, I would really like to try to avoid confusion.  

I am also attaching a clean copy of the current active version, and the 
current list of issues under consideration.  I suggest we work through this 
list and turn another draft before soliciting Cris/Herman and Lisa's 
comments.  We should also give the ENA commercial reps the opportunity to 
review it at that time.


Kay

Team Enron -  I spoke with Lisa this morning regarding her comments to the GE 
language, the substance of which follows. I  can discuss this on the call 
with GE, but I wanted the Enron participants to know what our issues are. 


1) Assignment  - Generally, if GE is going to require that we list all the 
possible assignees, the list should be broad enough to encompass the 
possibilities.  The comments below are designed to help make the language as 
broad and flexible as possible.  It would be best if we did not have to list 
them.

 A. 22.2(iii) and (iv) -  we need to make sure that the definition of  
"Facility" will be generic enough to cover any facility, not merely the 
one(s) which may be the subject of the particular agreement - also generally 
we will need to vet any defined term used in our sections to make sure it 
does not result in greater restriction than we planned ;

 B. I think we can remove the bracket before 22.2 (iii)(2) and add 
"Purchaser" to the list of folks who can agree to "convey a power plant 
project."  Also in that clause, we will need to confirm required "timing" of 
some power plant project development - does it mean only at the time of 
signing the agreement?  It should be for any power plant project in 
development either at the time of signing the agreement, or any project in 
development in the future.   Insert the number 3 before the last "and" in 
22.2(iii);

 C. The paragraph following 22.2(iv)(c) has references to "(v) and (vi)" 
above, which are no longer in the list; 

 D. The bold and bracketed language indicates that the terms of each of the 
"Facility Agreements" should be in "strict conformity" with the Ts and Cs of 
"this Agreement."   Although it is written in the context that there has been 
an assignment, Lisa wants to make sure that there is no expectation on GE's 
part that an Enron entity will necessarily remain as the "Agent."  Also, the 
language indicates that the assignee and the vendor will enter into an 
indemnity provision in the Facility Agreement that is in accordance with 
Exhibit E  (last sentence).  Does this still work given that the indemnity 
now runs only to the Purchaser? 


2) Limitation of Liability - 27.2 and 27.3  We may need to explain to the 
Enron accountants and AA that the reference to "indemnity" in these sections 
does not create a separate indemnity obligation on Enron's or WLB's part.   

3) Is the phrase "cognizant government" in 20.2(b) meant to apply to a 
governing body with jurisdiction over the Seller and/or Purchaser? 


Thanks,


Rose

I took the Mike Barnas language and added in all the "unreasonable to 
withhold consent" language from GenPower, to which I added the "financing 
structure" language.


I have attached a red-line, which you will need to "view" rather than 
"launch."  Please let me know asap if you think that this will fly with GE, 
or if the language needs to be softened at all.

 I think that I agree with the points and comments you folks raised in the
first echange on indemnities below, but don't have the document to refer
to. Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never
heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know
how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
"to the fullest extent permitted by law" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Subject:  GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)
(carve out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors,
ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely
and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its
subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers
simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that
we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence
of GE's subcontractors and vendors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase
price.
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another
party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call
to discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let
me know when, where, ect.

Kay

Sheila:

Per our last World Hunger meeting: Review GE Indemnity Language in theire 
Standard.  Upon inspection of GE's standard selling terms, I must report that 
the only indemnity GE provides is for Patent infringement.  Their document is 
silent on third party personal injury and property damage, and silent on 
hazardous materials.  Their standard language also stipulates limit of 
liability being capped at the purchase price for any and all claims.

Looks like we should take the lead on drafting language if we do not like 
what is in place now.  GE does not seem likely to volunteer to make it more 
fair or any better.

Not a problem.  Kay and I will try to get together later today.  

I see that I failed  to complete my train of thought under Section 14.1(i) re 
warranty term.  So attached is a revised copy of my markups to GE's suggested 
language.  You can disregard prior version.  

Have a safe trip,

Distinguished Distributees:

In the furtherance of our noble goal to reduce the number of required 
negotiation points on future contracts,  Enron and General Electric have 
struck a plan to have a general review and discussion meeting to table and 
duscuss contract provisions of mutual interest.  The first step towards these 
planned discussions is to develop the list provisions which the parties 
believe are not currently mutually agreed, and that can, following 
discussions at the meeting, be redrafted for inclusion in future contracts 
thereby reducing the need for further discussion thereafter.

Enron's first blush at the list of items that require such attention is 
attached below.  Comments from all recipients is hereby solicited.


We look forward to also evaluating General Electric's preliminary list, which 
we understand is forthcoming.

Best Regards,

Dear Turbine Torture Club Members:

The purpose of this email is to confirm that we will have a conference call 
this Wednesday, November 29 at 130 CT.  The following items have been 
suggested for the agenda:

Form of consent to assignment agreement (draft circulated) - to be used for 
LM's and Frames, if possible.
Assignment language - new language being tortured within the Enron ranks, to 
GE soon.
Limit of liability, indemnity, etc. - Enron owes GE a position on this.

In addition, it seems to me that the following equipment will be "moving" 
soon:

City of Austin LM's (to be assigned to ENA, then NEPCO)
LM's for the ESA project 
PSCO, LV CoGen, the remaining LM's, Pastoria, Blue Dog (all to DevCo, right?) 

I suggest that we address any commercial, financial or legal issues 
outstanding concerning the assignment of these turbines.

There may be others who need to be involved in the call, and there may be 
additional issues.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Kay

Folks,

Here is some language for discussion this afternoon.  Please note that this
is being submitted for discussion without full management approval; we're
getting so close to the bone that we'll probably need to take the final
package as a whole through our vetting process

I'm looking through the warranty section now, so perhaps we can discuss that
as well.

Ciao,


 Mike

The current form does not have the subcontract assignability language
and I agree that I am not sure we need 22.3.   Question to the team,
should I just put in the first part? Do we need language regarding an
Enron Corp. guarantee?

Peter:

Below is assignment language that we used in our going master before we
entered into the era of the off balance sheet structures.  I do not
recall
whether we have the subcontract assignability language.  I question
whether
we need 22.3.


This  Agreement or any right or obligation contained herein may be
assigned
by Purchaser without Seller's consent to:

     (i)  an Affiliate;

     (ii)  a  Joint  Venture, Partnership, or other similar entity in
which
          Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Affiliate  is  a venturer, partner
or
          participant;

     (iii)     Owner;

     (iv) Lender; or

     (v)   to  any  entity  for  the  purposes  of financing or sale of
the
          Facility.

Except  for  (i)  through  (v)  above,  this  Agreement  may be assigned
by
Purchaser  to  other  parties only upon the prior written consent of
Seller
which shall not be unreasonably withheld.  When duly assigned in
accordance
with the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure
to
the  benefit  of  the  assignee; any other assignment by Purchaser shall
be
void and without force or effect.

22.3     Agreement  with  Lender.   Seller  agrees  that  if  requested
by
Purchaser,  Seller  shall  enter  into a direct agreement with Lender
under
which Lender is permitted to "step into" this Agreement.

22.4    Assignment  of  Vendor  Agreements.  All Seller's subcontracts
with
Vendor  which  have  prices equal to or greater than $500,000 shall
include
provisions  giving  Seller  an  unrestricted  right  to assign the
relevant
subcontract  and  call  benefits,  interests,  rights  and  cause of
action
arising under it to Purchaser without Vendor's prior permission.

I took a quick stab at John's redraft of Section 10.3.2 but think we should 
talk further about subsections (j) -(l) in particular.

		 Subject: Rigby's Proposal for Take Over LD's Section 10.3.2

Attached is a redline against the present Take Over LD section of Rev 5 of GE 
world hunger.   I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They 
are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within 
their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW 
with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads.

I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works.  I have left it there to 
see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work.  I am trying to get GE on 
the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for 
Completion.  We did not do that in Arcos since GE's time in theory is the 
same as the contractors.


Probably merits an internal discussion before sharing with GE.

Steve:

1.   Attached is a clean version of the May 31st draft of the exhibits (rev 5 
) and a comparison to Rev 3.  The documents have been prepared by Peter.  
Soome of the exhibits have data unique to Longview in particular

A
A-1
B-3
B-5
the N series. 

2.  We need the following from GE

 a.  Electronics of the fuel spec for A-2
 b.  The electronics of the Scope of Supply for Exhibit B-1-  I think it is 
the SOW in the agreement in principle for Longview.

3.  Exhibit B- Specification is being handled seperately and should be close 
to complete.

4. We will need to plug in the Guaranteed Delivery Dates for Exhibit B-2.

5.  In Exhibit B-3 I based the output and heat specific performance guarantee 
values on the Longview AIP contract price.   We need to bottom out the 
exhaust energy and temperature LD's in Exhibit B-5 so I can calculate  the 
associated specific performance values.

6.  Exhibit B-5  Liquidated Damages.  I need to draft some proposed Delay LD 
language to deal with non- major components.  Once done and agreed I can 
revise the example to fit.   Also need to bottom out the exhaust related 
performance LD's.

7.  Exhibit E-   Need addresses.

8.  Exhibit F-  We are having Larry Lieb do quick review-

9.  Exhibit F-1-  Need to clarify who prepares the sound level test 
procedures.  Need to understand the intent of the first sentence of the 3rd 
paragraph of the 1st page and the 1st sentence of the 6th from last bullet.

10.  Exhibit F-2.   See bolded questions.

10. Exhibits I-    Will need to be fixed to the Longview deal for payment and 
cancellation with appropriate marking as I-1 and I-2.  Steve-  We will need 
to come up with more descriptive milestones other the "progress payment".  
Need to fix notes under the cancellation schedule.

11. Exhibit M-1    Need pricing for spares for Longview.

12.  Exhibit M-2-   paragraph 1.   Need to address GE's responsibility for 
more commissioning spares. Need to expand on the maintenance tools.

13.  Exhibit N-1 Price reconciliation needs review. 

14.   Exhibit R.   Will modify intro so as to make it clear that these are 
witness points and that additional witness points may be added during the QA 
kick off meeting.

Attached is the latest markup on the warranty language which GE is now 
reviewing.  I also have a few comments from John Rigby which may be worth 
adding but I suggest we hold off until we discuss the warranty language with 
GE next week.

I also spoke to Steve Swift who indicated that he would Email to Sheila what 
has been agreed to on indemnity, LOL, ect. and what we intend to insert into 
the Arcos contract.  FYI I do not intend to use the "end world hunger" 
warranty language in the Arcos contract as I want GE back-to-back on what we 
have signed up to with the owner under the EPC contract.

Regards,

Scott

Hi Pete, 

Here's the contract we discussed on the telephone.  To make life easier, 
please set the exhibits up as a separate electronic file.  It is a heck of a 
cut-and-paste job, but it will really help when we start blacklining docs.

Thanks,

Kay

We have reviewed your markups of the Article 22 Assignment clause.  In
looking at Section 22.2 (iv) it is our opinion that assignment "to any other
party" is too broad for GE to accept.

What we would like to propose is to continue with the concept of assignment
without consent for a well defined list of areas that Enron believes it will
do business.  Anything outside of this defined list would require GE's
consent.

During our call this afternoon I would like to see if we can do a good job
of defining the list of assignees that Enron wants to add to cover their
business interests and then try and put all the words around them once we
know the whole list.

Talk to you this afternoon.

Steve Swift

  I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as 
follows:

a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking 
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit 
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.

b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and 
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new 
technology.

c.   I "volunteered" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE 
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I 
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my 
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE 
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with 
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.

d.  I "volunteered" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in 
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the 
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.

e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the 
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks 
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached 
redline.

f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with 
performance.

Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They 
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at 
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.

I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.   
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger 
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there 
is an objection.  

I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and 
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please 
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.


Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the 
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

Paul-  we need to talk- I thought I heard that the 7FA' are not considered=

n=20
additional insured.  We are doing so in the case of Arcos.  What we are doi=
ng=20
in Arcos is making the vendor responsible under its warranty obligations fo=
r=20

I need to have a very clear understanding of what we can and cannot do it t=

case of GE 7FA units.  Deviating from the past practice on 7FA's where ther=

John:
The changes I suggested on the watercraft wording are still being reviewed=
=20
for completeness. I think what I gave you will work for most situations whe=

involved [contractor to sub to sub contractor] but it does not address ever=
y=20
situation that we could be involved in. We may need to expand our wording=
=20
accordingly.

Likewise, your question on giving to the turbine venders the waiver of=20
subrogation and additional insured is an even bigger concern. You are askin=
g=20
us to obligate ourselves in providing waiver and additional insured status =
to=20
GE which we cannot do.   As you know, we went many years with providing=20

does not matter if the machines are proto-type or not, there is a good chan=

If you need to have some language in the agreement, I would recommend that =

the insurance and begin placing it, we can then determine if the underwrite=

I am sorry I cannot make this easier but that is the nature of the insuranc=

Attached is a redline against the present Take Over LD section of Rev 5 of GE 
world hunger.   I made the changes based on what we have done in ARCOS. They 
are not the same because in ARCOS GE has the full testing program within 
their Commisssioning Period since they have the power island which is 1200 MW 
with the Purchaser having 24 MW for aux loads.

I do not think that my new subparagraph (K) works.  I have left it there to 
see if anyone else can tweak it and make it work.  I am trying to get GE on 
the hook for acceleration costs that we incur and still beat the Time for 
Completion.  We did not do that in Arcos since GE's time in theory is the 
same as the contractors.


Probably merits an internal discussion before sharing with GE.

John:
The changes I suggested on the watercraft wording are still being reviewed=
=20
for completeness. I think what I gave you will work for most situations whe=
re=20
the watercraft is incidental to the work or is far removed from our being=
=20
involved [contractor to sub to sub contractor] but it does not address ever=
y=20
situation that we could be involved in. We may need to expand our wording=
=20
accordingly.

Likewise, your question on giving to the turbine venders the waiver of=20
subrogation and additional insured is an even bigger concern. You are askin=
g=20
us to obligate ourselves in providing waiver and additional insured status =
to=20
GE which we cannot do.   As you know, we went many years with providing=20
turbine venders protection under the insurance because the market was soft=
=20
and underwriters agreed to it. Now they balk at giving it because of the=20
losses they have incurred and we cannot predict what they will agree to. It=
=20
does not matter if the machines are proto-type or not, there is a good chan=
ce=20
right now that they will not agree to insuring the vender. Everyone says it=
=20
only takes money and in many cases we could probably include venders on the=
=20
insurance but I cannot recommend committing to it in a long term contract =
=01)=20
we have to arrange the insurance at the time we need it in order to determi=
ne=20
if it is available.=20

If you need to have some language in the agreement, I would recommend that =
we=20
not give the waive and additional insured to GE or any vender. When we need=
=20
the insurance and begin placing it, we can then determine if the underwrite=
r=20
will cover the vender and ask for a price reduction from GE to move their=

I am sorry I cannot make this easier but that is the nature of the insuranc=

Subject:  Re: GE Language  (Document link: Scott Dieball)

 I think that I agree with the points and comments you folks raised in the
first echange on indemnities below, but don't have the document to refer
to. Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never
heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know
how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
"to the fullest extent permitted by law" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Subject:  GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)
(carve out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors,
ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely
and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its
subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers
simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that
we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence
of GE's subcontractors and vendors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase
price.
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another
party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call
to discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let
me know when, where, ect.

Kay

Folks,

Having conferred at last with my colleagues, I can now forward to you our
draft language for the Indemnity and LOL clauses.  As Steve mentioned in
his
earlier message, he has suggested some issues to discuss which could bring
us closer to resolution on that issue.  Please let me know if you have any
question!

One last Override.  As you will have seen in the ABB one and this one, I have 
made some global comments that apply to these plus the GE override for the 
LVCogenII turbine purchase agreement.  You will need to put them all together 
to get it all incorporated.  Sorry about that.

David and Paul:

As you are aware Sheila Tweed has been championing achieving a standardized 
turbine purchase agreement with GE for domestic applications.  Attached is 
the current draft of such document.  Please review the insurance provisions 
to see if there are any changes needed.   I believe the current drafting is 
what we have used in the past.   

Given the technology issues of late do we need to make any changes.  This 
would be for 7FA and LM6000 applications which I believe the market views as 
proven technology so I assume we will not need to shift collateral damage to 
GE and expose GE to insurer subrogation.


Scott Dieball and I are in London- Enron House.  Today Tuesday our telephone 
number is  44-207-783-0517.   Please call at your earliest convenience so we 
can discuss conceptually.

I would prefer not to make drafting changes for the sake of style at this 
point.

Thanks Peter for the updated exhibits.

Can you also send me by COB on Mon. a copy of the open issue list revised to 
reflect our discussion with GE this past Wed as I want to use it for purposes 
of our internal meeting/conf. call on Tue.

Thanks again.

Please see my comments to the attached GE TPA which John sent out on May 
22nd.  In it Ihave asked John to get Rose Engeldorf's comments on the "Misc 
Reps & Warranties" as I am unsure that they can be provided by E-Next as 
currently drafted.

I look forward to receiving the next turn with my comments incorporated or an 
email sooner if possible addressing the questions I posed therein.  If there 
are any questions of me first, please call.

sometime on Monday, I'll consolidate our thoughts and launch back to GE on 
Monday so that we can discuss with them on Tuesday.

Re Tuesday's conference call, I spoke to Steve late today about setting the 
call for 11:00 am CST which works fine for his schedule but he had not heard 
back from Mike.  I'll keep you posted if we are a go for Tuesday.

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Seems 
that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.  Here are 
the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
What is a cognizant government?  

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligation to 100% of purchase price.  
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another party's 
claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.

Comments?

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100 
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?

Kay

Folks,

Having conferred at last with my colleagues, I can now forward to you our
draft language for the Indemnity and LOL clauses.  As Steve mentioned in his
earlier message, he has suggested some issues to discuss which could bring
us closer to resolution on that issue.  Please let me know if you have any
question!

Attached is Art 11 as it appears in Rev 5, redlined to reflect my proposed 
fixes to the Change Order article.   GE has expressed concern over 
Purchaser's right to be able to force GE to proceed with a Change Order.   As 
presently drafted I do not see where the Purchaser has that right.  I have 
modified Article 11 to incorporate language similar to Arcos on this subject  
( we have not reached final agreement on the Arcos language- but we are 
reasonably close- I hope).  I have also imported the reasons for changing the 
Guaranteed Completion since the reasons for changing the Purchase Amount are 
now in Art 11.   

I think this needs an Enron team discussion before sending to GE.

Peter/Kay-

The addresses for Seller are fine in 25.1 and 25.3.  I redlined Exhibit A,
back to original guarantee conditions for those that efect our guarantee
performance values.

You should be able to get H-2 Training from previous contract (Ft. Valley).
If not, here's a pdf file copy.

Thanks,

Lee

Being as the below Sections 10.3.2 (e) and (g) were negotiated for a full 
Power Island supply with testing requirements very different from a GTG 
purchase contract's usual testing requirements, which aslo resulted in the 
agreement to expand the definition of the Commissioning Period to include all 
of the "Acceptanc Tests", I do not think that the below sections should be 
addressed or included in the World Hunger discussions.  The preceding was 
GE's arguement for their change in the first place.  There is a world of 
difference between a 30 day commissioning period for a simple cycle unit and 
26 weeks for a power island like we have for Arcos.  Apples and oranges 
applies here.

Attached is GE's suggestion for inclusion into Section 7.1 of the Contract.
This clause lays out the timing for any changes without impacting ship
dates.
------------------------------------------------
Also below are the revisions that are under discussion for the Arcos
contract for Sections 10.3.2 (e) and (g).  We can use these as a starting
point for these clauses.

10.3.2

(e) Purchaser makes reasonable efforts to provide the necessary time, access
and operating loads for Seller and Purchaser to commission and check out the
Power Island during the Commissioning Period.  Seller's time and load
requirement shall not be to the exclusion of the needs of other Station
equipment being commissioned.  Purchaser shall coordinate the most
advantageous utilization of time.  In the event Purchaser does not provide
reasonable time, access and operating loads during the Commissioning Period,
Seller will be entitled to an appropriate adjustment in the cost of
additional TD of I (to the extent the allotted manweeks per Appendix ____
are exceeded) and adjustment to the Commissioning Period pursuant to Article
____ of this Contract;


(g) In the event Seller fails to use its reasonable efforts to minimize time
to make corrections, adjustments or repairs to the deficiently performing
Unit during the Commissioning Period, Purchaser shall have the right to
reduce the Commissioning Period by the same time period that the Seller has
not used reasonable efforts to minimize time to make corrections,
adjustments or repairs to the deficiently performing Unit;

Talk to y'all tomorrow,

Peter:

Below is assignment language that we used in our going master before we 
entered into the era of the off balance sheet structures.  I do not recall 
whether we have the subcontract assignability language.  I question whether 
we need 22.3. 


This Agreement or any right or obligation contained herein may be assigned by 
Purchaser without Seller's consent to:

 (i) an Affiliate;

 (ii) a Joint Venture, Partnership, or other similar entity in which 
Purchaser or Purchaser's Affiliate is a venturer, partner or participant;

 (iii) Owner;

 (iv) Lender; or

 (v) to any entity for the purposes of financing or sale of the Facility.

Except for (i) through (v) above, this Agreement may be assigned by Purchaser 
to other parties only upon the prior written consent of Seller which shall 
not be unreasonably withheld.  When duly assigned in accordance with the 
foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the 
benefit of the assignee; any other assignment by Purchaser shall be void and 
without force or effect.

22.3   Agreement with Lender.  Seller agrees that if requested by Purchaser, 
Seller shall enter into a direct agreement with Lender under which Lender is 
permitted to "step into" this Agreement.

22.4   Assignment of Vendor Agreements.  All Seller's subcontracts with 
Vendor which have prices equal to or greater than $500,000 shall include 
provisions giving Seller an unrestricted right to assign the relevant 
subcontract and call benefits, interests, rights and cause of action arising 
under it to Purchaser without Vendor's prior permission.

I was supposed to make a "To Do" list of the World Hunger Team:

Limit of liability/Indemnity - Steve has provided a draft.

Assignment - although we reached an accord for TurboPark purposes, the basic 
issues remain for discussion.

Confidentiality - Mike has circulated a revised draft.

Termination - This ones on my list.

Warranty - Scott has some comments to discuss.

We also discussed streamlining the time lines, etc.

Kay

Subject:  Re: GE Language  (Document link: John Schwartzenburg)

 I think that I agree with the points and comments you folks raised in the
first echange on indemnities below, but don't have the document to refer
to. Scott, please drop by and brief me on these.  Cognizant Gov't? Never
heard of  the term, and itis not one of the usual defined terms. Don't know
how it's used here, suggest you decline andmake them clarify.

LOL ISSUES:
1. I suppose that this is a NY law contract. I  do not think you can
effectively limit your liability for gross negligence or wilful misconduct
in NY. Regardless of choice of law, we generally cannot get this limited
or excluded in contracts with owners, either.  I think you should not
accept any GE attempt to limit this by means of the cap on liability or
otherwise , and should avoid muddying the water on the point by taking any
"to the fullest extent permitted by law" clause or other  such stuff as a
compromise. It will be important every time we wrap the GE equipment.

2. Generally, I do not think they should be able to limit their indemnity
for Haz Mat, patents, etc.

3. They have consistently refused to clarify that the indemnity  for all
third party losses includes third party consequentials when Brian or
whoever else over here has been the lead negotiator with GE in the past. I
would like to think that we could get it clarified now that the larger
Enron is working it.  Please try it again if you can.

Subject:  GE Language

I'm not particularly wild about many of the changes proposed by GE.  Agree.
Seems that it would be a good idea to get a consensus on how to respond.
Here are the issues I see:

Indemnity issues:
They should indemnify us from claims by their employees/subcontractors.
Kay - Is your comment in connection with GE's comment to Section 27.1(iii)
(carve out of the 100% LOL for "gross acts" of its subcontractors, vendors,
ect.)?  GE is in an aggressive outsource mode and needs to remain solely
and totally responsible for the actions and liabilities for its
subcontractors and vendors.  I think Section 20.2(a) as written covers
simple negligence of GE's subcontractors and vendors and I would argue that
we need to keep Section 27.1(iii) as written dealing with gross negligence
of GE's subcontractors and vendors.
Indemnity should be triggered by strict liability as well as negligence.
Agree - Maybe we could agree to GE's strike out in 20.2(a) provided the
phrase "negligent or willfully wrongful" is replaced with "negligent, at
fault or strictly liable without fault" (or some variation thereof).
What is a cognizant government?  Don't know!  This was not discussed with
MIke so I am not sure what is the meaning of adding this term.  We need to
also think in terms of how we could be harmed in a situation where GE fails
to comply with law, and instead of Enron incurring a monetary penalty, is
ordered to shut down the facility.

Limit of liability issues:
They want to limit their indemnity obligations for complying with laws,
patent infringement, liability for haz. waste and liens to 100% of purchase
price.
They want the limit of liability to apply to gross negligence, if possible.
Agree - See 1st comment above re indemnity.
They don't want to clarify that they have to indemnify us for another
party's claim for consequentials (as in a personal injury claim).  Agree.

We've don't have anything concrete on assignment yet.  Agree.

Comments?  I suggest we get together before our next scheduled conf. call
to discuss our game plan.

Sheila has asked that we change Wednesday's call to 1100 Central, or 100
Central if 1100 doesn't work.  Is this a problem?  Works for me...just let
me know when, where, ect.

Kay


They should have to

Folks,

Having conferred at last with my colleagues, I can now forward to you our
draft language for the Indemnity and LOL clauses.  As Steve mentioned in
his
earlier message, he has suggested some issues to discuss which could bring
us closer to resolution on that issue.  Please let me know if you have any
question!

One of the World Hunger issues is that GE does  not want Enron to be able to 
issue a unilateral change order which would impact the manufacturing schedule.

We have the same issue in the Arcos Power Island deal.  

Following is what I intend to propose to solve the Arcos problem and might 
work  for World Hunger:


" Purchaser acknowledges taht Seller's ability to accomodate changes in 
manufacturing scope in a timely or cost effective manner diminish as Seller 
gets further along into the manufacturing process, and after a point changes 
can only be made after assembly completion or in the field without adversely 
affecting Seller's manufacturing obligations to other clients (a "Client 
Impact").  Where such a Client Impact circumstance exists, Seller shall 
identify such constraints to Purchaser in its proposal submitted pursuant to 
Clause 17.2.(b) [time and cost estimate to accomodate the Change 
Order-Variation Order], which Purchaser shall take into account in evaluating 
Seller's proposed cost and time changes arising out of such Variation scope 
change. "




I would appreciate your thoughts as to whether this works for us in the World 
Hunger document-  I do  not want to propose for Arcos if it gives you great 
difficultly for World Hunger.

Attached is GE's suggestion for inclusion into Section 7.1 of the Contract.
This clause lays out the timing for any changes without impacting ship
dates.
------------------------------------------------
Also below are the revisions that are under discussion for the Arcos
contract for Sections 10.3.2 (e) and (g).  We can use these as a starting
point for these clauses.

10.3.2

(e) Purchaser makes reasonable efforts to provide the necessary time, access
and operating loads for Seller and Purchaser to commission and check out the
Power Island during the Commissioning Period.  Seller's time and load
requirement shall not be to the exclusion of the needs of other Station
equipment being commissioned.  Purchaser shall coordinate the most
advantageous utilization of time.  In the event Purchaser does not provide
reasonable time, access and operating loads during the Commissioning Period,
Seller will be entitled to an appropriate adjustment in the cost of
additional TD of I (to the extent the allotted manweeks per Appendix ____
are exceeded) and adjustment to the Commissioning Period pursuant to Article
____ of this Contract;


(g) In the event Seller fails to use its reasonable efforts to minimize time
to make corrections, adjustments or repairs to the deficiently performing
Unit during the Commissioning Period, Purchaser shall have the right to
reduce the Commissioning Period by the same time period that the Seller has
not used reasonable efforts to minimize time to make corrections,
adjustments or repairs to the deficiently performing Unit;

John:
I have reviewed the insurance article and would not mind recommending a few=
=20
minor changes but respect your wishes not to. However, I did find a couple =
of=20
places where it is definitely needed.

After speaking with a few marine experts at Wortham I have found our Hull &=
=20
P&I wording to be deficient [did this on another project]. I believe Clause=
=20
19.1.4 should be changed to the following recommended wording. You are=20
welcome to change the limit [$10 million] but I think the wording is more=
=20
appropriate for all agreements going forward.

Hull & Machinery and Protection and Indemnity Insurance. Seller shall ensur=
e=20
that if any owned or non-owned watercraft of any kind is used for performan=
ce=20
of the Work, Hull & Machinery and Protection and Indemnity insurance shall =
be=20
provided for the vessels in the amounts as follows:

Hull & Machinery:
Full current market value of the watercraft.

Protection &Indemnity including excess collision liability [unless otherwis=
e=20
provided by the hull coverage]:
$10,000,000 each occurrence or the full current market value of the vessel,=
=20
whichever is greater.

Such insurance may be provided by the vessel operator or by Seller as Selle=
r=20
deems appropriate.

The aircraft clause needs a couple of changes:

In Clause 19.1.6 insert =01&aircraft=018 after =01&non-owned=018 in the thi=
rd line.

Such insurance may be provided by the aircraft operator or by Seller as=20
Seller deems appropriate.


Please let me know if you have any questions.
Paul

David and Paul:

As you are aware Sheila Tweed has been championing achieving a standardized=
=20
turbine purchase agreement with GE for domestic applications.  Attached is=
=20
the current draft of such document.  Please review the insurance provisions=
=20
to see if there are any changes needed.   I believe the current drafting is=
=20
what we have used in the past.  =20

Given the technology issues of late do we need to make any changes.  This=
=20
would be for 7FA and LM6000 applications which I believe the market views a=
s=20
proven technology so I assume we will not need to shift collateral damage t=
o=20
GE and expose GE to insurer subrogation.


Scott Dieball and I are in London- Enron House.  Today Tuesday our telephon=
e=20
number is  44-207-783-0517.   Please call at your earliest convenience so w=

can discuss conceptually.

I would prefer not to make drafting changes for the sake of style at this=
=20
point.

In our discussions regarding the Purchaser's remedies in the event of Seller 
default, we discussed the need for language providing for a refund of 
progress payments made paid in addition to cover damages if the equipment is 
not delivered or the Purchaser elects not to take it.  Attached is the 
language used for the East Coast Power Linden 6 turbine contract.  While the 
attached language does not all conform to the current template, this may be 
useful.
