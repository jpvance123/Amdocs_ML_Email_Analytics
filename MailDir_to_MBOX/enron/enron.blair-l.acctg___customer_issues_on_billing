Vicki & Bill,
Just wanted to let you know that Dari and I have reviewed this RER issue re=
garding the usage of SMS at alternate points.  We stand strong in our inter=
pretation of how SMS is applied at alternate points on an SOL day; however,=
 given that RER did in fact correct their usage of SMS once they were notif=
ied in February with an answer to their questions from December, we can see=
 the logic in waiving a portion of the accrued DDVCs.  At this point we are=
 more than happy to draft a letter to the customer, but we are looking to y=
ou to let us know how you would like to proceed.  If there is value in work=
ing with the customer on this issue, we will record an entry in the waiver =
log for RER.  We wouldn't be changing the manner in which SMS is applied du=
ring an SOL day at an alternate point, but we would be recognizing that cir=
cumstances warrant waiver in this situation.  At this time if you would pre=
fer not to waive the charges, we will proceed ahead with drafting a respons=
e to the customer.  Please let us know the direction you would like to take=
.

Ranelle & Dari

Subject:=09RER Dec '00 Receivable

Hey guys,

As an update to the RER Receivable, they have paid the outstanding dollars =
due on their November 2000 invoice; however, they continue to claim that No=
vember was paid in good faith (for whatever it's worth) and they have no in=
tention of paying the December 2000 invoice of approximately $132,000.

Back in May you asked whether or not RER had incurred similar charges the p=
rior heating season.  Lisa and I pulled the January 2000 DDVC/SMS Charges a=
nd indeed RER was not allocated or did not utilize SMS on SOL days when sch=
eduled deliveries at alternate points were below their Contract Entitlement=
.  However, the order of magnitude was significantly smaller with less end =
user points and the occurrence was comparably infrequent since it appears f=
rom the documentation that they tended to schedule long on most days during=
 January.

I think we need to move forward to resolve this issue.  I would very much a=
ppreciate your help in drafting a response to their request, per my e-mail =
below, to provide in writing our position and supporting provisions of the =
tariff.

Anyone other suggestions on an alternative approach?

Thanks much,
Vicki

Subject:=09RER Receivable

I talked with Doug Stark at Reliant Energy Retail (RER) this afternoon rega=
rding their outstanding invoices for SMS/DDVC charges in Nov'00 and Dec'00 =
.  Pursuant to that conversation, Doug indicated that in good faith RER wil=
l agree to pay NNG for the Nov'00 charges of approx.$87,000; however, RER d=
oes not intend to pay the Dec'00 charges of approx. $132,000.  RER continue=
s to dispute NNG's position or tariff interpretation which does not allow S=
MS to be used at alternate points on SOL days when their FT contract is not=
 fully utilized.  I should say that they acknowledge or understand that int=
erpretation going forward; however, RER's position is that in the penalty p=
rovision sections of the tariff, it does not specifically address those cha=
rges at alternate points such that without further definition RER's interpr=
etation is appropriate.

I have communicated to RER that after thorough review, Northern strongly be=
lieves the SMS/DDVC charges are appropriately due.  However, RER did call t=
o discuss their November bill in mid-December and with our transition of pe=
ople, they did not get a response back from me until the end of January 200=
1.  Therefore, I could be convinced to negotiate a portion of the charges d=
ue for Dec'00; however, at this point, I would not recommend we agree to wa=
ive them in total.

Dari/Ranelle - Doug did request a letter from us which articulates our posi=
tion and includes supporting provisions of the tariff.  Also, he  sent a le=
tter dated March 1, 2001 with their position which I will fax to you if you=
 don't have a copy.  Some of the points in his letter have since been resol=
ved so please call to discuss if you reference the same.

Any other suggestions on how we should proceed?

No, Alliant only agreed to pay for the commodity and cashout imbalance invoices for the previous 6 months (which they did).  They sent Northern a letter stating they disputed our collection beyond the 6 month GISB window.  I had worked with Kathy Washington and Dan Fancler to make sure the $932,585 would be placed in suspense versus showing up as a receivable on our books.

I am still working with Dari and Shelly on a letter to be sent to Alliant which addresses the GISB standards and the fact Northern believes they are responsible for the invoices.

Lynn, regarding the letters that you asked me to look over, I thought that they had agreed to pay these invoices.  We currently have on IES's accounts receivable an amount of $932,585.91 which represents $25,342.30 for commodity invoices and $907,243.61 for imbalance invoices.  We have already waived the DDVC invoices of $23,697.36.  If you have any further questions, just let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta

 Just a follow up on this issue. Most of the October PPAs have been processed with a few exceptions. Hopefully, all will be complete at the end of this week. We are still working on finding a way to systematically identify the late charts. I'll keep you advised of the progress on that front.
 Have a safe holiday !
Gary.

All of the MidAmerican corrections for October have been made with the exception of 0737181-01,0737021-01, & 0737021-02. The charts were never received form these locations. Dan Boswell has been out of the office due to his Father's death but should be back tomorrow. We'll get a handle on the other outstanding PPAs this week.
Thanks-

Subject:	October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn
