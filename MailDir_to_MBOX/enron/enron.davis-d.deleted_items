A little blessing for my friends.....

 
  I HAD YOU ON MY HEART

  I asked the Lord to bless you
  As I prayed for you today
  To guide you and protect you
  As you go along your way....
  His love is always with you,
  His promises are true,
  And when we give Him all our cares
  You know He will see us through
  So when the road you're traveling on
  Seems difficult at best
  Just remember I'm here praying
  And God will do the rest.

  Pass this to at least 10 people you want God to bless and don't forget to
send it back to the one who ask God to bless you first.

Hi,

I got your email.  Thank you for keeping me up on what's going on.  I was at the school yesterday sitting in on some of Candis' classes but I didn't get to make it in time to see you.  Hopefully I will be able to meet you during Open House. Until then, thanks again.

Hi, 

This is your child's English teacher - finally got your E-mail addresses into my address book.  Please reply so I know you got this message ...

In case you do, you should know that we have a quiz tomorrow in class over their homework tonight, which counts half their grade.  The assignment should be written down in their agendas.  It is to read p. 456-8 and answer the questions on p. 459, exercise 2, #1-10.

Thanks!

Hi Zac - sorry it took a while to respond but things are quite busy here.  Yes, there are opportunities here.  However, the question is what our business looks like going forward given the circumstances facing Enron in the coming weeks and months.  I'm not sure how it is all going to play out.  I know there will be opportunities but how I'm going to go about filling those and what limits are placed on our business hasn't been made clear yet.  I'll be glad to take some time to sit down and talk about this with you and give you any direction I have.  You are welcome to call my secretary, Tamara Black, and get on my calendar.

Dana,

It has been a while since we have run into each other and had a chance to catch up.  I hope everything is going well for you and Rachel.  

I understand that there are currently opportunities in origination, structuring and trading within the East Power Trading group.  I am interested in those opportunties and would like to talk to you about them.  Do you have time to discuss the group, the opprotunities, etc.?

I look forward to talking to you,
Zac

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject: 

A woman named Frances once knew a young person at church named Debbie.
Debbie always seemed effervescent and happy, although Frances knew she had
faced struggles in  her life.
Her long-awaited marriage had quickly ended  in divorce.  She had struggled
to get a grip on her single  life. She hadn't chosen it, but she  decided
she would live it with  utmost enjoyment and satisfaction.
Debbie was active in Sunday  school, in the choir, as a leader  of the
junior high girls' group, and in the church renewal movement. Frances
enjoyed knowing Debbie. Debbie's whole face seemed to  smile and she always
greeted  Frances with a hug.
One day Frances asked Debbie, "How is it  that you are always so happy?  You
have so much energy, and you never seem to get down?"  With her eyes
smiling, Debbie said, "I  know the secret!"  "What  secret is that?" What
are you talking about?" Frances asked.
Debbie replied, "I'll tell you all about  it, but you have to promise to
share the 'secret' with others." Frances agreed, "Okay, now what is it?" The
secret is this: I have learned there is little I can do in  my life that
will make me truly  happy. I must depend on God to make  me happy and meet
my needs. When a need arises in my life, I have to trust God to supply
according to HIS riches. I have learned most of  the time I don't need half
of what  I think I do.
HE has never let me down. Since I learned that  secret I am happy.  Frances'
first thought was, That's too simple! But upon reflecting over her own life
she recalled how she thought a bigger house would make  her happy-but it
didn't! She  thought a better-paying job would  make her happy-but it
hadn't.
When did she realize her  greatest happiness?  Sitting on the floor with her
grandchildren, eating pizza and watching a movie a simple gift from God.
Debbie knew the secret, Frances learned the secret,  and now you know it
too!  We can't depend on  people to make us happy-only GOD in his wisdom can
do that. Trust him.
And now I pass the secret on  to you! So once you get it, whatcha  gonna do?
YOU have to tell someone the secret, too! That GOD  in his wisdom will take
care of  you

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%

Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit

---   ability to embrace change

3.	Work environment:

---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Attached FYI is a memo prepared by IPPNY summarizing a NY Court of Appeals =
(NY's highest court) decision issued last week that could impact environmen=
tal reviews of projects that are smaller than 80 MW and thus not subject to=
 the State's siting law. As noted by IPPNY, the impact of this court ruling=
 could be to delay the environmental review and thus the permitting time fo=
r these smaller plants.  In other generation-related developments, the NYS =
Siting Board last week approved the Astoria Energy project. This is a 1,000=
 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle facility to be loacted in Astoria, Que=
ens, New York City. The plant is estimated to go in service the 3rd quarter=
 of 2004. This brings to over 1600 MW the amount of new in-city generation =
recently approved by the State Siting Board, on top of the 400 Mw\W added t=
his past summer by the NY Power Authority.

Member Alert #48-2001
November 26, 2001

Court of Appeals issues Potential Setback to SEQRA Generators In NYPA Turbi=
ne Ruling

On November 20, 2001, the New York State Court of Appeals denied a motion b=
y the New York Power Authority ("NYPA") for leave to appeal a Appellate Div=
ision decision, Uprose v. Power Authority of State of New York, requiring t=
he preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") for its install=
ation of 10 GE LM6000 turbines at several sites in New York City.  (IPPNY's=
 brief supporting NYPA's motion was accepted by the Court.)  The impact of =
the ruling may be to delay the environmental review for projects evaluated =
under the State Environmental Quality Review Act ("SEQRA").

The Court of Appeals, the State's highest court, did not affirm the Appella=
te Division's decision, it merely declined to consider the appeal, which wa=
s discretionary.  The decision is binding only in the courts of the 2nd jud=
icial department, which includes Long Island and Westchester, although cour=
ts in other areas of the state may rely on the case for guidance.

Prior to the lawsuit, NYPA issued a negative declaration of potential signi=
ficant impact with regard to the turbine projects, a SEQRA prerequisite to =
proceeding without preparing an EIS.  The Appellate Division decision requi=
red that NYPA prepare an EIS by January 31, 2002 because NYPA's analysis of=
 particulate matter 2.5 ("PM2.5"), which relied on an evaluation of PM10 as=
 a proxy, was insufficiently detailed to support a negative declaration.=20

The potential impact for new generation projects is that applicants proposi=
ng power plants under 80 MW, which are subject to SEQRA, may be required to=
 prepare an EIS.  A State agency may still be able to issue a negative decl=
aration, and thus avoid the requirement to prepare an EIS, if an applicant =
demonstrates in its Environmental Assessment Form ("EAF") that there is no =
potential for adverse environmental impacts from PM2.5.  However, as a resu=
lt of the Uprose decision, the applicant may not be able to make this demon=
stration by relying on a PM10 proxy analysis.  If the demonstration cannot =
be made that PM2.5 will not have a potential adverse environmental impact, =
the agency must make a positive declaration, requiring the preparation of a=
n EIS and associated public notice and participation.  Potentially signific=
ant delay could result from this process.

The Appellate Division decision should have little impact on Article X appl=
ications.  The Article X process supplants the SEQRA process.  Essentially,=
 the Article X process requires the preparation of an EIS equivalent, where=
in PM2.5 is analyzed.  At least one case, Consolidated Edison's East River =
Repowering Project, has addressed the PM2.5 issue.  In that case, the Depar=
tment of Environmental Conservation ("DEC"), Department of Health, and the =
Department of Public Service agreed that the only applicable legal standard=
 for PM2.5 is the PM10 proxy standard.  The Board on Electric Generation Si=
ting and the Environment ruled that PM2.5 was not an issue in the case beca=
use it is within the purview of the companion DEC air permit proceeding.  A=
 ruling distinguishing the Uprose case was made by the Commissioner of DEC.=
  Although the court found that the proxy analysis conducted by NYPA was no=
t sufficiently detailed in the EAF to support a negative declaration under =
SEQRA in the Uprose case, the DEC Commissioner found in the East River case=
 that the PM10 analysis will support the determination as to whether or not=
 the proposed project complies with the PM2.5 standard.

In an unrelated development, the FERC last week issued two orders addressin=
g issues related to market mitigation.  In its Order Establishing Refund Ef=
fective Date And Proposing To Revise Market-Based Rate Tariffs And Authoriz=
ations ("Market Rates Order"), FERC instituted a proceeding to investigate =
the justness and reasonableness of the terms and conditions of market-based=
 rate tariffs and authorizations of wholesale generators.  FERC noted that =
it intends to revise all existing market-based rate tariffs and authorizati=
ons by adding the following language (which will be included in all new aut=
horizations, as well):

"As a condition of obtaining and retaining market-based rate authority, the=
 seller is prohibited from engaging in anticompetitive behavior or the exer=
cise of market power. The seller's market-based rate authority is subject t=
o refunds or other remedies as may be appropriate to address any anticompet=
itive behavior or exercise of market power."

FERC indicated that the refund effective date will be 60 days from notice o=
f the Market Rates Order in the Federal Register.

In a second order, FERC announced that it will implement an industry-wide s=
tandard market mitigation measure that will address conditions of market sh=
ortage in which market power could be abused.  The surplus margin assessmen=
t ("SMA") tool will be employed by FERC to determine what entities possess =
market power.  The SMA will replace the FERC's existing "Hub-and-Spoke" met=
hodology for determining whether an entity possesses market power.   Entiti=
es that fail the screen are required to sell uncommitted capacity into the =
spot market pursuant to a form of cost-of-service rates.  The SMA order exp=
ressly does not apply in New York, because FERC noted that it will not appl=
y this new mitigation procedure in markets (including NY) where market miti=
gation plans have been approved by FERC.

Copies of the orders are available upon request.  If you have any questions=
, please don't hesitate to contact IPPNY.

Dana:

Just wanted to send you a summary of the Nov SWAPS I sold for you last night.  

Sold 10,000 @ 2.45
Sold 15,000 @ 2.445
Sold 70,000 @ 2.44

for a total of 95,000 sold.

The bid stayed between 2.43 and 2.425 the rest of the night so I didn't sell the last 5,000.  
Thanks for giving me the opportunity to work with EOL.  
Be sure to keep me in mind if you need a night time trader (ha).

Sincerely,
Andrew Greer

PS. Check out Galatians 2:20 when you get the chance.

Several months ago a compensation survey was commissioned by Rick Causey to see how Enron's accounting compensation compared to our peers, with our main objective being to retain and attract the best possible talent.   The survey was comprehensive, including Fortune 100 companies and two big-5 accounting firms.  The results of the survey have highlighted that some of our salaries are below today's market. So ... we set out to fix that. 
We spent a significant amount of time looking at individual salaries benchmarked against the survey results of positions with similar responsibilities and experience levels.  Existing internal equity issues were also considered.
Early next week, we will contact everyone to discuss where your current salary falls in our new ranges. If your salary is going to be adjusted, we will communicate your new salary at that meeting. We will also give you your new Enron Wholesale Services - Financial Operations shirt ( yes.. we have changed our name back to Financial Operations). All salary adjustments will be effective September 1st. 
I know that this has been a busy and challenging year for everyone and is likely to remain that way for awhile. We have made tremendous progress toward our major goals this year of cleaning up our accounts, understanding our balance sheet, getting our arms around our cash flow, dealing with tremendous volume growth in trading and building timely and value-added management reporting products. I recognize and appreciate all of your efforts.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

A judge was interviewing a woman about her pending divorce. He sat her
>down in his office and asked, "Now, what are your grounds?"
>
>She replied, "About two acres, and a nice little house in the middle and
>a stream running by."
>
>"No," he said, "I mean what is the foundation of this case?" "It's made
>of concrete, brick and mortar," she responded.
>
>"I mean," he said, "What are your relations like?" The woman said, "I
>have an aunt and an uncle living here in town, and my husband's
>parents."
>
>Becoming frustrated, the judge said, "Do you have a real grudge?" "No,"
>she replied, "Just a two-car carport."
>
>"Ma'am," he tried again, "Is there fidelity in your marriage?" "Well,
>both my son and daughter have stereos," she replied. "Though we don't
>really like that noise they call music."
>
>The judge sighed. "Ma'am, does your husband ever beat you up?" "Yes,"
>she responded, "About three times a week he gets up before me and makes
>breakfast."
>
>Finally, in frustration, the judge asked, "Lady, why do you want a
>divorce?"
>
>"Oh, I don't want a divorce," she replied. "I never wanted one. My

THIS WAS FORWARDED FROM A FRIEND OF MINE ON THE POLICE FORCE!!!!!


FYI......................................

 I think you all know that I don't send out

 hoaxes and don't do the  reactionary thing and send out anything that

crosses my path.  This

one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility

in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it  out to all of you.

 My friend's friend was dating a guy from

 Afghanistan up until a month ago.

 She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was

understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.

On 9/10, she received a letter from her  boyfriend explaining that he wished

he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had

to be like that.  The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get

on any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to

 go any malls on Halloween.  As soon as everything happened on the 11th, she

called the FBI and has since turned over the letter.

This is not an email that I've received and

 decided to pass on.  This came from a phone conversation with a long-time

friend of mine last night.

 I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with

 one of his warnings being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take

the chance on the second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about

had the same information

 that I did.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

We have all been to those meetings where someone wants "more than 100%."
>Well here's how you do that. Here's how you can achieve 103%. First of

>
>IF :
>
>A = 1
>B = 2
>C = 3
>D = 4
>E = 5
>F = 6
>G = 7
>H = 8
>I = 9
>J = 10
>K = 11
>L = 12
>M = 13
>N = 14
>O = 15
>P = 16
>Q = 17
>R = 18
>S = 19
>T = 20
>U = 21
>V = 22
>W = 23
>X = 24
>Y = 25
>Z = 26

>Then:
>
>H A R D W O R K =

 procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Subject: GOD's Awesome Power


Well, sisters and brothers,

Once again I have been a witness to the awesome power of GOD.

Yesterday evening some of the members of MOP gathered to go over to the new
property to consecrate it before the Holy Ghost Fiesta on Saturday, August
18.  

In attendance were Minister Jackie, Evelyn Morris, Mother Jackson, Denise
Moore, Bonnie Abraham, Liz Booker, Yolanda, Claudette Montgomery, Betty
Nance, Grace Jackson, Jerry Johnson and me, Katherine Dailey.

Bonnie read scriptures from the bible (I think Hezekiah).  We then anointed
our hands with oil and we proceeded to walk the property.  We each took a
section and walked from one end (across from the apartments) to the other
(the next intersection).  While walking we prayed, asking GOD to bind any
unclean spirits connected to the property and to loose his righteousness and
good will.  It was quite a unique experience.  I think we all felt his
presence!

The best part happened when we returned to the place where we started.  We
had all made it back; except for Claduette and Yolanda and we were holding
hands praying.  We heard a strange sound and we looked around and this woman
was coming up with Claudette and Yolanda and she was crying, praying and
speaking in tongues.  She was perspiring profusely and had a look on her
face that was very unusual. She was actually running across the field almost
falling to her feet.  She immediately grabbed hands with the circle and
started to pray with us.  When she could speak she said that she was a
minister and happened to be walking along when the Spirit of GOD drew her to
the field.  She said she had no choice but to be obedient because the Spirit
of GOD was so strong.  She said that GOD was pleased with what we were doing
and that we would all be blessed for our obedience to his will!  She also
said that she was head of a Ministry of women similar to MOP that meet on
Saturdays and after the meeting on this Saturday she will definitely come to
the Holy Ghost Fiesta!

Before we began I had asked GOD to give me a sign that he was pleased with
what we were doing.  What more confirmation does one need?

ISN'T GOD JUST AWESOME?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Your Sister in Christ
Katherine

Subject: a married man left work

A married man left  work early on Friday afternoon. in stead of going
home, however, he  squandered the weekend and his paycheck partying
with the boys. When he  finally returned home on Sunday night, he ran
into a furious  wife.

After a couple of hours of nagging and berating, his wife asked,  how
would you like it if you didn't see me for a couple  days?!!!!

"That would suit me just fine!!!"

So Monday went by,  and the man didn't see his wife. Tuesday and
Wednesday came and went with the  same result. Come Thursday, the
swelling went down a bit and he could see her  a little, just out of
the corner of his left  eye....

Tired of the 40 x 40 x 40 Plan? You know:

I am looking for people with a Good Work Ethic and extraordinary Desire to Earn at Least $10,000 per Month Working From Home!

This LEGTITMATE HOME-BASED INCOME OPPORTUNITY can put you back in Control of your Time, Your Finances, and your life!

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

Either today or Monday, I expect the NYISO to announce that it will be offering its 3-day Market Orientation Course in Houston December 11-13 at the Hyatt Regency. Enrollment will be limited to 150 people on an as-registered basis, so early registration is encouraged. The on-line registration process will be included in their announcement, which will be broadcast to the ISO's TIE list as well as put on their web site www.NYISO.com. Because Enron has previously sent people through this training course, the costs for Enron employees attending this training session will be $800.00 per person, rather than the normal $1,200.00 charge. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Hello.  This notice is being sent to all trained fire wardens I have listed=
 at Enron Center North.  As you may know, each year the Houston Fire Depart=
ment reviews every high rise building to make sure they are in compliance w=
ith the Houston city fire code.  As part of that process, it is required by=
 law that Enron maintain accurate records of all trained fire wardens as we=
ll as keep an ongoing list of any persons with a mobility impairment who ma=
y require special assistance during a fire drill or evacuation.  A fire dri=
ll will occur at Enron on or before December 1st.  Therefore, as trained fi=
re wardens on your respective floors, if you know of anyone who may require=
 special assistance during an actual fire drill or building evacuation, ple=
ase forward there names to me so that I may obtain their contact informatio=
n to maintain on file.  The Houston Fire Department is subject to fine Enro=
n between $250 and $2000 for every daily violation that occurs if these rec=
ords are not kept up to date.  Note, this information is strictly for use t=
o have on file for the Houston Fire Department.  It will be kept confidenti=
al.  Thank you in advance for your assistance. =20

market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

Dear NYISO Market Participants:

On December 11 - 13, 2001 the NYISO will present NYMOC in the Lone Star
State. We've just posted the course on our web site at

http://www.nyiso.com/services/training/cinfo/index.html

This course is similar to NYMOCs run in the Albany NY area, except that it
does not include Billing and Accounting details. The program will address
the latest system updates, however, and rigorously covers all marketplace
topics.

The course will be conducted at the Hyatt Regency Houston, 1200 Louisiana
Street, Houston, Texas, from 8:30 am  Tuesday December 11 until 3:00 pm
Thursday December 13. If you're interested, we suggest you register early
as we expect a healthy turn-out. In order to get a realistic count, there
will be a $300 charge for no-shows, or for cancellations not made by 12:00
noon Monday, December 3.

Please call Customer Relations at (518) 356-6060, if you have any questions
regarding the course, or Debbie Doyle at (518) 356-6274 regarding
registrations.

Carolyn,
What's going on.  You didn't look good last night.  You said you were tired but it looked like you were upset about something.  Is everything really ok?

How are yall doing today, blessed I hope.  Powertime was Good yesterday. Pastor talked from Genesis dealing with Adam, Eve and the serpent.  And why God let the serpent temp Eve.  Mainly because he wanted to give us choices.  He wanted to know if we would serve him if there were other things to serve, and Pastor also talked about the origins of devil from Ezekiel.  It was very good.  Hope the rest of the day goes great for yall. Tell Matt (if I don't talk to him today), and the rest of yall's families I said Hi and I miss them of course.
 
Much Luv,
 
Monte.

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

Sorry for the delay in updating you, but we've spent this past week working through credit-related issues in support of this transaction.  I've attached our most recent communication to Calpine, and we have begun discussions on which market regions can be supported under this transaction by Calpine's merchant portfolio.  We will be meeting with Calpine next Tuesday to discuss the size of the transaction and determine the positions and regions that best suit Enron & Calpine.  We will continue to push for PJM-E and Nepool components based on our earlier discussions, but I suspect FRCC volumes will end up being much less than listed in the term sheet below.  

Dana, currently EES has subscribed for the 50mw RTC energy listed in the term sheet below.  I will follow up with you today to see if you have any interest in expanding our Nepool subscription.

Timeline is still a little uncertain, but we are pushing to close by Nov 15.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

- Jim


FYI - here is the most recent VAR analysis we ran on these positions (based on positions in the book on 10/4/01)

Attached are a draft letter of understanding and term sheet describing the proposed Master Power Prepayment Agreement.  We have also enclosed a summary explanation that is very useful in describing, step-by-step, the entire transaction.  Please give Carl (713-345-8958) or me (713-345-7702) a call if you have any questions or comments.

We look forward to hearing from you soon.

With growing revenue, a dominant position in major energy-trading markets
and a depressed stock price, Enron Corp. would logically be prime takeover
bait. But in the topsy-turvy world of Enron, what constitutes logic
anymore?

Takeover speculation has swirled around Wall Street and the energy markets
in recent days as Enron shares have plummeted by about two-thirds to their
lowest level in a decade, a selloff sparked by a loss of investor
confidence in the Houston energy-trading company following big
third-quarter write-downs and the disclosure of a Securities and Exchange
Commission inquiry into transactions involving its former chief financial
officer. Among the names bandied about as potential buyers of all or at
least a substantial chunk of Enron are General Electric's GE Capital unit,
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and Royal Dutch/Shell. GE and Berkshire
had no comment. A spokesman for Shell couldn't be reached.

Meanwhile, Enron has approached at least one major institutional investor,
seeking a capital infusion, according to a person familiar with the matter.
But Enron was turned down because of uncertainties over its financial
condition, this person says.

While Enron shares, which are trading at about book value, look cheap by
historical standards and even compared with two weeks ago, it isn't clear
whether history is much guide when evaluating Enron these days, say
analysts and others. Even fans of the stock have long complained about
difficulty understanding how Enron operates because of its enormously
complex financial structure and relatively sparse disclosure. For years
while Enron's stock price was soaring, much of Wall Street didn't seem to
care about such issues.

30)

(Oct. 29)

Partnerships (Oct. 25)

Now with Enron's stock dropping, that lack of understanding is haunting the
company. "How bad could Enron get? That's really the question," says
Prudential Securities analyst Carole Coale. Tuesday, Ms. Coale reduced her
price target for Enron shares to $9 and maintained the "sell"
recommendation she recently put on the stock. At 4 p.m. Tuesday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down $2.65, or 19%, to
$11.16, down from nearly $85 a year ago.

"When a business like this starts a down cycle, they've got to stop it and
stabilize before anyone will be willing to have a really intelligent
conversation with them," says Peter J. Solomon, head of Peter J. Solomon
Co., an investment-banking boutique.

An Enron spokesman says the company won't comment on takeover speculation;
nor will it comment on whether it had approached potential investors about
a possible capital infusion. However, the continued plunge in Enron shares
and turmoil surrounding the company are a significant "overreaction in the
marketplace. Our core businesses are strong," he says. The company has said
that it is taking steps to restore investor confidence.

For example, Enron is trying to negotiate a new credit line with its major
banks. Late Tuesday, Enron's bankers were putting the final touches on a
new credit line of more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with
the discussions.

Analysts and other observers say that one uncertainty surrounding Enron is
the condition of its vast energy-trading operation. As the nation's biggest
energy trader, Enron is a principal in one-quarter of all electricity and
natural-gas trades. Enron's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has
transacted more than $884 billion of trades since it was created in
November 1999 and does about $4 billion a day in transactions.

One worry is that Enron's trading partners, edgy about the turmoil swirling
around the company, will start demanding much tougher credit terms from the
Houston company or simply cut back doing business. Such a trend, if it
picked up enough momentum, could have troubling consequences for Enron. "We
are all in suspense. ... It all depends on how the market reacts," says
Susan Abbott, a managing director at Moody's Investors Service. On Monday,
Moody's downgraded Enron's long-term debt.


There were some warning signs of unease among trading partners even before
the company's third-quarter earnings release set the stage for the huge
drop in the stock price. About six to seven weeks ago, Entergy Corp. became
worried about its level of exposure in Enron-related deals, says Wayne
Leonard, chairman and chief executive officer of the big New Orleans energy
company. Since then, Entergy has cut its Enron exposure to about $10
million to $20 million from $90 million to $100 million, he says. Mr.
Leonard didn't specify what prompted the worries, which appear to have
arisen after the surprise August announcement by Jeffrey Skilling that he
was resigning as Enron president and chief executive. Mr. Skilling cited
personal reasons as well as his concerns over the falling stock price.

While the Enron spokesman says the company doesn't comment on specific
trading arrangements, he adds that Entergy is one of his company's smaller
trading partners. He says major trading partners are doing business with
Enron on "essentially the same terms and conditions" and that overall "our
trading operations are as strong as ever."

The company spokesman adds that a few smaller trading partners in Europe
are seeking revised credit terms from Enron. "We are working to put
together credit terms, which they are more comfortable with," says the
spokesman, who declines to be more specific.

In an effort to bolster its liquidity and position in the marketplace,
Enron last week drew down some $3 billion, accounting for the bulk of its
existing credit lines. While it used most of that money to buy its
outstanding commercial paper, a short-term corporate IOU, the company
retained about $1 billion of the borrowings as cash.

A friendly takeover of all or part of Enron would be likelier than a
hostile one. Among the most obvious candidates would be other companies
with big trading operations and experience in risk management. Two possible
deterrents to a would-be buyer: a flurry of recent shareholder lawsuits
filed against Enron and the continuing SEC probe

Dana,

I work for Fred Cohagan in EBS Asia Pac -- and I believe he's spoken to you about the fact that we're scaling back around the region.  

I had mentioned to him that I'd like to get involved with the Power Desk and he suggested that I give you a call.  If you're available, I'd be very interested in talking about any opportunities in your group.

I'll try to reach you on Tuesday afternoon, CST.

Subject: a married man left work

A married man left  work early on Friday afternoon. in stead of going
home, however, he  squandered the weekend and his paycheck partying
with the boys. When he  finally returned home on Sunday night, he ran
into a furious  wife.

After a couple of hours of nagging and berating, his wife asked,  how
would you like it if you didn't see me for a couple  days?!!!!

"That would suit me just fine!!!"

So Monday went by,  and the man didn't see his wife. Tuesday and
Wednesday came and went with the  same result. Come Thursday, the
swelling went down a bit and he could see her  a little, just out of
the corner of his left  eye....

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

Subject:	Full Requirements - Due Dilligence Items

I've been asked to pull together a "road-map" of the list of due dilligence items that need to be vetted on full requirements deals for Origination's off-site meeting next week.  I have drafted an initial list, attached below, but would appreciate any feedback you can offer on additional items or detail.  Thanks

- Jim

THIS WAS FORWARDED FROM A FRIEND OF MINE ON THE POLICE FORCE!!!!!


FYI......................................

 I think you all know that I don't send out

 hoaxes and don't do the  reactionary thing and send out anything that

crosses my path.  This

one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility

in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it  out to all of you.

 My friend's friend was dating a guy from

 Afghanistan up until a month ago.

 She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was

understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.

On 9/10, she received a letter from her  boyfriend explaining that he wished

he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had

to be like that.  The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get

on any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to

 go any malls on Halloween.  As soon as everything happened on the 11th, she

called the FBI and has since turned over the letter.

This is not an email that I've received and

 decided to pass on.  This came from a phone conversation with a long-time

friend of mine last night.

 I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with

 one of his warnings being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take

the chance on the second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about

had the same information

 that I did.

Dana,

It has been a while since we have run into each other and had a chance to catch up.  I hope everything is going well for you and Rachel.  

I understand that there are currently opportunities in origination, structuring and trading within the East Power Trading group.  I am interested in those opportunties and would like to talk to you about them.  Do you have time to discuss the group, the opprotunities, etc.?

I look forward to talking to you,
Zac

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Good Morning -

Hope your are doing well in all this rainy weather.  I wanted to ask you a question and your opinion of the odds of me being placed if I go into the redeployment program?  I got my review back and it is much better than it has been in a long time.  I guess I am just concerned that if I don't make a move now, year end might not be as favorable for me.  Rumor has it that the other clerk that I work with has found another job and will be leaving on the 14th of Sept.  I have been caught in such a vicious cycle so long that I just don't know what else to do.  If you have time call me or email me.  I just want to know what you think.

dd

The following checks were paid during the period of July thru November 2000 via Citibank Delaware 38621208.

1000000839  10-06-00   $  5.674.79   Noxtech Inc  {0413-5000044872}

These checks were voided by A/P after printing; however, they were mailed to the respective Vendors and subsequently PAID.

I would appreciate if anyone could advise the following SAP account information, as required, in order that SAP Account 0530-10235055 Outflow Check Clearings can be offset to the appropriate expense.
  Company
  Account Code
  Cost Center
  Profit Center
  Order
  WBS Element
  Material

We would like to record the expense during November 2001 business.

Thanks.
Stacey Lee Burnett

Tomorrow is the last chance to donate for the walk I will be doing for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society on October 27.  Below is a link to give you more information on what MS is and what your contribution will go towards.

Move to a leaner Enron 
Enron has divided its business units into three categories: core businesses it plans to keep; noncore, which are for sale; and under review, ones it may sell. 
All core businesses are expected to be retained, while noncore businesses, which include about $8 billion in assets, will be sold or spun off over the next year. Those businesses under review are those that the company says have good earnings potential, but it's not yet clear if they will stay.

Hi Zac - sorry it took a while to respond but things are quite busy here.  Yes, there are opportunities here.  However, the question is what our business looks like going forward given the circumstances facing Enron in the coming weeks and months.  I'm not sure how it is all going to play out.  I know there will be opportunities but how I'm going to go about filling those and what limits are placed on our business hasn't been made clear yet.  I'll be glad to take some time to sit down and talk about this with you and give you any direction I have.  You are welcome to call my secretary, Tamara Black, and get on my calendar.

Dana,

It has been a while since we have run into each other and had a chance to catch up.  I hope everything is going well for you and Rachel.  

I understand that there are currently opportunities in origination, structuring and trading within the East Power Trading group.  I am interested in those opportunties and would like to talk to you about them.  Do you have time to discuss the group, the opprotunities, etc.?

I look forward to talking to you,
Zac

Interviewed a candidate yesterday who works for a competing shop.  They have a less sophisticated method of pricing full-requirements deals that I thought you might find interesting.

Customer migration - they price as a Put
Load following - they know its a short straddle position, but they have no tools to value so they base the price on historicals
Hedging - they always look to hedge out the position with standard block purchases
Ancillaries - they do no analysis, and simply add margin to the transaction
Adjustment clause - they have been adding fuel adjustment clauses to the deals that allow them to be cheaper up front
Booking - they have 2 books, spec trading and structured trading, the originator maintains P&L exposure on the transaction and works with the trader to assess how to manage/hedge the positions

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I really really want to get out of here.  I was just told by my admin. that when I get here at 6:45 am that Renee gets in a little after me and is watching me, so I need to be careful of what I do.  What do they think I do play around.  This makes me so mad, I could scream.

Dana,

Thank you for your vote of confidence today.  I'm really grateful to have a shot at the trading track.  It means a lot to me and I promise to work very hard to prove myself.  

I was wondering if you would be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime over the next couple weeks.  I'd be very interested to hear your take on the trading track and what you would do if you were in my shoes.

Jason

From: 	Ken Lay - Office of the Chairman  
Sent:	Friday, November 09, 2001 5:49 PM
To:	DL-GA-all_enron_worldwide1
Subject:	Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy


Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

Just that if the new grp that I've come to is a core part of Enron's business that Dynegy wants to keep, I have a better chance of keeping my job.  Boy,  I tell you, this year has certainly been challenging year.  I'm not worried though (not anymore, took about a week).

Hello Everyone - 

It's that time of year again, when we all want to get some Christmas shopping done and just don't have the time.  I have come to your rescue.....I am having a catalog party, which means I will have my "Christmas Around the World" and "Open Invitation" by House of Lloyd catalogs @ my desk (EB3712A) until November 16th for your shopping enjoyment!!!  No money will be collected until Nov.16th (after payday...of course!!)
  
No pressure, no fundraising, no donating......just providing great shopping at your fingertips.  If you are unfamiliar with "Christmas Around the World" & "Open Invitation", here is a link to give you a peek at what they have to offer..... http://www.open-invitation.net/web/tinacaywood

All I ask is, that you please do not order on line or it will not count towards my party....I will have it shipped to my house and I will deliver to you personally.

Thanks for your time and hope you have a great Holiday Season!!!

FYI:
John House had their clerk  deliver Crescendo to Rick Carson before I got there and I took over Westwin.  So, now he has them both.  I told them that they were both due Monday and he said after Don Rollins takes a look at them he would call for pick up.

much love....


GOD IS UP TO SOMETHING -- (T.D. Jakes) 
"When you are DOWN to nothing ... God is UP to 
something" 
Father, in the Name of Jesus, bless the one 
reading this in a special 
way. Open supernatural doors in their life today. 
Save and set free! 
Give them a double portion of your Spirit as we 
take back everything 
that the devil has stolen: Emotional Health, 
Physical Health Finances, 
Relationships, Children, Jobs, Homes,Marriages. 
I cancel every plot, plan and scheme the enemy 
has devised against 
them, in 
the MATCHLESS NAME OF JESUS. 
And I declare: 
NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST THEM WILL PROSPER. 
I speak LIFE into every dead situation. And, I 
thank you that nothing 
is over until YOU say it's over! I speak 
prophetically into their 
lives and to their situations: 
Their household is blessed; 
Their health is blessed; 
Their marriage is blessed; 
Their finances are blessed; 
Their jobs are blessed; 
Their children are blessed; 
Their grandchildren are blessed; 
Their parents are blessed; 
Their siblings are blessed; 
Their ministries are blessed; and, 
Their decisions are blessed. 
Husbands are on the way; 
Wives are on the way; 
Mortgages are paid and canceled; 
Their hearts desires are on the way; 
according to YOUR perfect will and Plan for their 
lives. 
IN THE NAME OF JESUS! AMEN! 
Pray this prayer back to the one who prayed it 
for you, then 
Send to EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. Within hours 
countless people will have 
prayed for you, and you will have caused a 
multitude of people to pray 
to God for other people. 
"In our daily lives, we must see that it is not 
happiness that 
makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that 
makes us happy."

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

No problem.  Kind of slow but today is my 2nd day and my new boss was out yesterday and today.  So far so good though.

Hi Lindsay -
You don't have to send me this email anymore.  I am no longer in finance.  Thanks.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Harris		713-368-2309
Montgomery	936-539-7843
Waller		979-826-7643
Brazoria	979-864-1320
Fort Bend	281-341-8670
Liberty		936-336-4629
Chambers	409-267-8301
Galveston	409-766-2280
