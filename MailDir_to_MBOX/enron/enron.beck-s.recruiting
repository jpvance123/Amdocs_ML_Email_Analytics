Dear OU Team:

We are in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended.  In order to ensure our cultivation efforts I have assigned each of 
you to one or more candidates to contact weekly, beginning this week.  

By taking "ownership" you will create a more personal relationship with your 
candidate(s) and help us to stay abreast of any questions or concerns they 
may have.

Please keep me posted regarding these cultivation efforts so that no one is 
left out.

Thanks again for all your work and participation!  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

We will be meeting for dinner at Legends restaurant at 5:00pm with Ted 
Jacobs, Tim Rasnic, and some of the students from the JC Penney
Leadership and Energy Management program. Following the dinner, we will 
proceed to the presentation at the Oklahoma Memorial Union in 
the Scholars/ Associates room located on the third floor and the program will 
start at 8:00pm. Jody Crook will introduce the presentation and 
then Steve Venturatos who will talk about his career and how he has 
transitioned from Land man to an Enron director. I will facilitate the 
discussion 
and pass the questions to the team. A social will follow the discussion and 
last until approximately 10:00pm. I will have a rent car for the group and 
take everyone  to and from the dinner, presentation, airport, etc. I will be 
in the office all day today and until 11:00am tomorrow if anybody has any
questions or concerns. Thank you for your help.

I agree.  I will coordinate with Kristin (for the Associates) and make it 
happen.
Once I have a date in mind I will let you know.  The latest start date for 
interns is June 4, so I will try to schedule it for the last week in June or 
very early in July.

Thank you!

Subject: Re: Intern Acceptances and Declines  

Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their 
assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from 
the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it 
would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so 
that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums throughout 
the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?  
It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will 
be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.

Dear Cultivators:

We are currently considering making some changes to the full-time offers this 
season.  Therefore, those candidates with the December 20 accept deadline 
will be given until January 2.  Please keep this in mind should your 
candidates have any questions.  I have sent each of them an e-mail informing 
them of the extension.  Those candidates which have already accepted will be 
sent a new offer letter, if necessary.

Thanks to those of you who are keeping me abreast of your cultivation 
efforts!  Please continue to let me know when you call/e-mail these 
candidates so that I can track our activity.

Thank you very much!

Hi Sally,

Am assuming you got the OU stickers for your new vehicle and that David has
already put them on by now.

I will be in Houston the end of this month (May 30- June 2) and would like
to take you to lunch if possible and get caught up on everything.  I have
also asked Mike McConnell to join us if possible. Hopefully the two of you
have a free day available for lunch and can coordinate a time and day. Let
me know if and when the two of you would be available and I will schedule
around your plans.

I guess Michelle, Clay and Blake will have been there for a week when I am
there.  I was sad to see George leave the recruiting side, as he really did
a good job of promoting Enron to both OU and my students. I know he will do
a great job at Enron OnLine.

Hope all is going well with your father and that you are not constantly
traveling around the world and being away from your family.

Look forward to hopefully seeing you later this month.

Please review the revised strategy.  Everyone has not been selected as a 
participant yet.  I have been working on logistics.  I was just approved 
today to have the presentation in Stone Davis Hall.  I have also been going 
back and forth with a contact Fariha gave me to set up a faculty lunch and 
classroom presentation.  As confirmations come in, I will update the 
strategy.  I have a meeting with Cindy Olson on September 18, 2000.

We have reserved hotel rooms for the overnight stay events.  Debbie Flores, 
my Coordinator has made those arrangements and will have confirmation 
numbers.  You will be responsible for booking your flight arrangements and 
rental cars in Boston.

If anyone has questions, please leave me a message or e-mail.  I am out on 
the road recruiting at the other schools I am assigned to.



Thanks again, Geynille

Dear Karen, 

Thank you again for including me in your group of finalists for the Enron 
Scholarship.? Enron's commitment to community service and education is most 
admirable, I and felt honored to be selected (particularly considering the 
other people chosen).? I even enjoyed the interview experience, mostly 
because of the neat interviewers.

I also appreciate the prompt replies to all correspondence, as well as the 
follow-up call this evening (even if the news was not quite what I wanted to 
hear).? It's great to see people "doing it right".? If you need any 
assistance with future events at UT, please don't hesitate to call.

Sincerely, 

David Silldorff

Ted,

Thanks for responding so quickly - I will put Thursday, June 1 lunch date on 
her calendar and hope you will be able to make it.  If not, I will let Sally 
know that she will be meeting w/ Tim Rasnic instead.  I have also scheduled

We look forward to seeing you again,

Patti,

Go ahead and schedule lunch for Thursday, June 1st. I am trying to
reschedule my Thursday lunch for Wednesday. If not, Tim Rasnic, of the
J.C.Penney Leadership Program will be able to go, as he is going to be in
Houston that day and also needs to visit with Sally about the upcoming Fall
events with Enron. I am hoping I can rearrange my schedule and joining them.
If not, I know I will be in Houston again on June 19 & 20 and will
reschedule with Sally if she is available on those dates (please check her
calendar and let me know). I will let you know about next Thursday soon as I
find out.

Thanks for your efforts in coordinating this.

To All EMSA students,

Attached are two versions (Word and Power Point) of a flier regarding the
Enron Informational Meeting next Tuesday (September 19th).

As the flier states, Mike McConnell, an OU graduate and a graduate of this
program (formerly known as PLM), will be the main speaker. Mike is a former
landman and is a very dynamic speaker. Mike recently assumed the position of
President and CEO of Enron Global Markets, L.L.C.. Though many of you have
heard him before. Mike has a completely new and exciting power point
presentation he will give. Not only will he talk about new things going on
at Enron and in the energy business, he will also discuss what is going on
in Exploration & Production too. It is my understanding he will also give a
fascinating demonstration about Enron On-Line ( Enron's revolutionary idea
that has completely changed the way gas and other commodities are now
traded).

I realize many of you have night classes (i.e.. Oil and Gas Law, etc) and
cannot miss it. However, you need to plan on attending the social, after
class, at Coach's. Jody Crook, Sally Beck (Vice President of Energy
Operations) and  Lexi Elliott (Enron's new college recruiter) will be here,
along with other Enron representatives, to meet and visit with you about
career opportunities with Enron and discuss questions you might have about
the energy industry in general.

Also, Enron will have a booth at the Career Fair the following day
(Wednesday, Sept. 20th). You should also plan on going to that and visiting
with them and the other companies that will also be on campus to look at EM
students too. This will give you a good comparison of what type of
opportunities that are out there and to compare the management styles of
each of these companies. I know that Enron invites comparison, as they have
obviously been very successful with their style.

Again, I expect all of you that do not have class conflicts, or try to make
arrangements to have someone cover for your class,  to attend all or at
least the social part of this presentation. Needless to say, Enron, and
especially Mike McConnell, are taking the time and expense to come up and
visit with you and to look at this program. It was this program and both Ms.
Beck's and Mr. McConnell's support, that first brought Enron to OU. We need
to make the same type of commitment to them and show them how much we
appreciate Enron's support of our program and the hiring of OU students. The
new "Participation Point  Policy" will be in effect for this and attendance
and non-excused absences will be noted.

For your information, this week is the week to sign up for Enron interviews,
through the Career Services website. Enron is scheduled to be here on
Monday, October 9th for first round interviews. If you make it to the second
round, those will take place on Tuesday, October 10th. So be aware of your
schedule to allow for interview times for both Monday and possible Tuesday
when interviewing with Enron.

Should you have any questions, or have problems opening these attachments,
please let me know.

See you at the EMSA meeting on Sunday night (e-mail coming) and next week at
"An Evening with Enron".

Rick, Sally, Brent, and Hunter:

Each of you should have already received our stack of resumes for review.  I 
am attaching an excel spreadsheet which includes the names of all the 
attendees from our General Presentation.  It is relatively sloppy, but the 
information is there.  You will be able to search by name to epedite the 
process.  I have included a column whih indicates an "*" asterisk to let you 
know that particular candidate was targeted by our team members at the event, 
or that the candidate has sent a follow-up e-mail to me expressing interest.  

I hope this helps.  I know the turn-around time is far too quick, but please 
have the decisions back to Donna by noon tomorrow.

Let me know if I can help in any other way.

Thank you!!!!

Geynille and team,

I'll be at Harvard on the 3rd and the morning of the 4th--I'm happy to take 
the short drive to participate in the reception on the evening of the 4th. If 
needed I can participate in interviews on the 5th. 

 Also, Carol/Cindy, I'd like to see if we can follow up on the Jean Baker 
Miller Training Institute research relationship possibilities sometime on the 
5th.

Geynille, I'll take care of my own arrangements and expenses, but would you 
please reserve a room for me (for the evening of the 4th) at the same 
location as the rest of the group will be staying?

Thanks!

--Christie.

Sally,

Over the past year or so Enron has made a great impact at the University of 
Oklahoma.  In a very short time we have become one of the employers of
of choice within the College of Business.  We have been able to do this by 
paying attention to details and going beyond the necessary.  We have formed
great relationships and planted seeds that will reap benefits for years to 
come, if we do not become complacent.  I for one am an example of the 
impression
that Enron has forged at OU.  I am here because I believe that Enron 
represents one of the greatest opportunities in not only the energy industry, 
but the 
but the business world in general.

I am sending this note because I believe we are taking steps that will lessen 
our momentum at the University of Oklahoma.   I have learned that we will
not be sponsoring any entertainment for our presentation this fall.   As you 
know, last year we sponsored a hypnotist and a drama team for entertainment 
after our presentations.  Being a student at the time I felt this was a great 
idea and I know that my fellow students enjoyed the presentations as well.  
They felt that it was a great opportunity to gain insight from Enron 
representatives as well enjoy the entertainment which we provided.  As I 
understand the A/A program now takes the position that this does not provide 
any residual value for Enron and does not warrant the expense.  I do not 
understand this reasoning and feel that there is great value in such an 
arrangement.  It places another selling point on our presentation and gives 
us a better opportunity to familiarize ourselves with upcoming talent.   This 
may seem like an  insignificant detail,  but I hope we will see the value 
that this opportunity presents.  The students of the EM Program and the J.C. 
Penney Leadership Program are expecting another exciting evening from Enron 
and hate to see us fall short of these expectations.  It is very likely that 
if we do not sponsor this event one of our competitors will.  The competition 
for talent is growing and we can not allow ourselves to become overconfident 
in our recruiting efforts.  Enron is a great place to work and we must take 
that image to campus.   I know that Mr. McConnell is a very exciting speaker 
and will no doubt amaze those present.  That is why we should take this 
simple step to have as many potential leaders present as possible and 
continue our path to recruiting dominance at the University of Oklahoma.

I am fully aware that you were the instrumental element in putting OU within 
Enron's sights.  Your involvement at OU is greatly appreciated and I hope you 
maintain
your interest in the University of Oklahoma.  Please consider my views on 
this matter and express any concerns of your own to the Analyst and Associate 
Program.

Thank You,

Jody Crook

This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

Larry May

Sally,

Have you had a chance to look at UT presentation for Monday?  I will need to 
email final copy to Lexi by Monday morning (her flight is 2:00 PM) and she 
would like a cd for backup.  I can handle that.  She has supplied me with new 
dates for last page.  If you get a chance to review - just fax pages to me at 
713-345-8100.  If not, I can work on it monday morning.

Again, I am so happy for you.  It's such a BIG deal to be promoted to MD.  
Please share any thoughts you might have with me on how this affects my role 
as your assistant and what I can do to better assist you.  You know, this job 
that I have now with you is the job I have waited for all my life.  It is 
challenging, fast-paced, and has a lot of potential for growth.  You make me 
feel like I the work I am doing is important and valuable.   I have an 
enormous amount of respect for you as a person and of the work that you do 
and know that I am extremely lucky to have this job.  

Patti

Dear UT Team, 

Good news and bad....

I just received notice that Melanie Sandoval will be declining our offer.  
Although we offered more money, he has chosen to accept with Neiman Marcus in 
Dallas.
However, Ali Ahmed will be accepting our offer!  He is expected to start once 
his practical training authorization becomes effective in February.  Please 
call and congratulate him (512/469-9105 or aliahmed@mail.utexas.edu).  He 
will be out of the country tomorrow through January 7.

Happy Holidays!

Dean Zerillo:  Please see below.  As you may know, Enron awards first year 
MBA students scholarship money for their second year through the Enron MBA 
Excellence Awards.  We have scheduled an awards dinner for September 7 in 
Austin at Jeffrey's restaurant.  I am Director of Community Relations for 
Enron and have been on maternity leave, but I am now back in the office.  As 
my note to Susan White below indicates, Karen Marshall is joining our team 
and we would like to work with you or someone from your office on details for 
the awards dinner.

Please let me know if you are the appropriate person to contact.  I can be

Hello Elyse - I'm no longer with the Dean's Office.  You should contact

 Susan:  I have returned from maternity leave and wanted to
reconnect as
 related to the Enron MBA Excellence Awards and specifically the
dinner on
 September 7 in Austin.  Karen Marshall has joined the Community
Relations
 team and will be focusing on higher education.  She will be the
new liaison
 between Enron and the University of Texas as related to the
awards.

 When I left in April for maternity leave, the university had not
yet
 selected the winners.  I am assuming that those selections were
made, and
 the winners have been notified. Can you please let Karen and me
know who
 the winners are and who should be invited from the university
for the
 dinner at Jeffrey's on September 7.  We have reserved the
private dining
 room again this year and would like to send out invitations to
the
 attendees.

 We appreciate your help in this matter.  I hope you are enjoying
the last
 few weeks of summer vacation!

Subject: Summer Internship


Lexi Elliot,

Hi, my name is Judd Eisenberg, and I am a business student at the
University of Texas who is seeking the summer analyst internship at Enron.
I received an opportunity to meet you at a reception dinner that Enron
hosted last semester in Austin.  I have always been intrigued with the
analyst and associate rotational programs that Enron offers.  The courses I
take in school, accounting and particularly finance, my extensive job
experience, and my leadership positions have provided me with valuable
skills for the summer analyst position.  I have a good friend at UT who
will start working full-time for Enron in the IT division in a few months,
and I know he is truly looking forward to the challenges and opportunities
that Enron provides.  Because I am currently interning with
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Houston, I am not able to go through the
recruiting process at the university.  I am sending an attachment of my
resume in this e-mail since I am going to be in Houston until mid-March.
Please e-mail me if there are any openings for the position I am seeking or
if you have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Judd Eisenberg

All of the scholarship recipients are available for dinner on May 10th.  As soon as you let me know where you want to meet for dinner, I will let them know.  If you don't have any place in mind, I can locate a nice casual dining place for you.

Thanks,

Thanks to each of you for your help Monday night.  The Information Session 
was a success!  We had over 100 interested students attend, and I believe 
that each one was able to ask questions and speak to an Enron 
representative.  

The dinner afterwards was also quite a success.  We were able to spend time 
with 19 of our full-time candidates...congratulating those who have accepted, 
and convincing those who have not yet signed.  It, too, was quite successful 
as I had 2 additional acceptances the following morning from Geiv Dubash and 
Daniel Jenkins.

Thanks again!

My name is Alexus Rhone, and I'm your new staffing/recruiting contact.  I'm 
looking forward to working with each of you to assist in identifying, hiring 
and retaining a strong workforce for Energy Operations.  As most of you may 
know, Samantha Ray is now recruiting for EES.  And I'm sad to report Gail 
Francis will be joining her effective this week.

Linda Vargo will replace Gail as my assistant.  Together she and I will work 
diligently to handle your recruiting needs.  Please be sure to carbon Linda 
on any written correspondence with me concerning opening requisitions or 
requesting interview schedules. 

I've already met most of you.  And I look forward to meeting the rest of you 
before too long.  If you need anything, please don't hesitate to call me at 
ext. 3-3202 or Linda Vargo at ext. 3-0637.

Hi Ted,

I had Sally blocked off from 11:00 to 1:00 for lunch this Thursday, but we 
will need to change time to 11:30 instead - a meeting that she must attend 
has been scheduled until 11:30. Sally says it would be great if you and Tim 
pick her up out front at that time.  Do you have a cell phone number?  I will 
make reservations for the 3 of you at Irma's.

Also,  I talked to Cathy in Mike McConnell's office about lunch June 20.  
Unfortunately, he will be in S. Korea during that time.  Per Cathy, he is 
making 3 overseas trips this month (S. Korea, Brazil & Japan) so he will be 
quite busy.  She did say for you to keep trying.  

Patti

Patti,

Go ahead and schedule lunch for Thursday, June 1st. I am trying to
reschedule my Thursday lunch for Wednesday. If not, Tim Rasnic, of the
J.C.Penney Leadership Program will be able to go, as he is going to be in
Houston that day and also needs to visit with Sally about the upcoming Fall
events with Enron. I am hoping I can rearrange my schedule and joining them.
If not, I know I will be in Houston again on June 19 & 20 and will
reschedule with Sally if she is available on those dates (please check her
calendar and let me know). I will let you know about next Thursday soon as I
find out.

Thanks for your efforts in coordinating this.

the

Just let me know.

We are looking forward to both dinner and our lunch/office tour of Enron.
Again, thank you for the effort and support Enron puts forth for our
program.

George, unless I hear otherwise, we will plan on meeting you and Shelly
tomorrow night at 8:00 at The Sierra Grill on Montrose. If we are running a
little late, we will be there shortly.

Dear OU Team:

Thanks to each of you for your help this season.  As many of you know, this 
past Super Saturday was quite a success! 

I have included a list of the 7 candidates in attendance this past weekend.  
Unfortunately, 2 out of the 7 candidates will not receive offers.  I have 
indicated them in gray.

I have personally called all 7 candidates to inform them of their offer 
status.

Thanks again for all your help!  Please feel free to call and congratulate 
these superstars!

Rick and Sally

I told the scholarship winners that within the next few weeks, we would like 
to meet with them for lunch or dinner  before the semester is over.  So since 
we are on the subject, do you have plans to be in Austin any time soon?  I 
will coordinate the students around your schedule.  Also, if you think there 
are others that should join the smaller luncheon/dinner, let me know.  I 
thought about asking Traci Warner and Billy Lemmons since they are new to the 
AA program.

Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The 
dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  
But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and 
a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around 
the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a 
more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their 
being chosen.  --Sally

Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Irfan Iqbal

Attached you will find a list of OU alumni from the GIS system.  Please look 
it over and let me know if there are any alumni that you feel should be added 
to our OU team.  The information in this spreadsheet is taken directly from 
GIS, so it should be fairly accurate and complete.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

Thank you for your help.

Have a great day!

Whittney:

The internships are slated to last from 10 to 12 weeks.  If you are able to 
complete 10 weeks, there will not be a problem.  We actually had the same 
problem with candidates last year.  Please just indicate your date 
considerations on your offer letter so that HR knows you will not be here a 
full 12 weeks.  As long as we know in advance, there should not be a problem.

Thank you so much!

Lexi,
I have a concern regarding the summer internship position....
I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I
have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer
job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12
weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks.
The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents
a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the
offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If
you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!!
Thanks so much.
Whittney Skinner

Sally,

Just something from a recruiting prospective for us to think about, 
remembering the situation from last fall of George making the mistake of 
extending verbal offers, quoting incorrect salaries, and the difference being 
recovered by your RC, I wanted to bring the potential of a residual OU salary 
issue to your attention.  

The salary being offered for another internship or full-time position, which 
ever applies, may appear (to the OU candidates) to be wrong.  Interns will 
enter the program at the same pay rate, $3,000 monthly and the full-time 
analysts at 40k.  As you know, both salaries are non-negotiable for 
consistency amongst the program participants.  

I'm sure questions will come up regarding compensation and thought we could 
discuss the inevitable.  I would really like your input on how to "soften the 
blow".

I look forward to your response.
Thanks
Shelly

Sally,
 I tried to get on your calendar but you are busy this week so I decide to 
send you a very important e-mail. You told me to contact you if I was ever 
considering leaving my current job so I am doing so at this time. I want to 
say that I have thoroughly enjoyed working with you and you are the most 
impressive employee at Enron at any level. I feel comfortable speaking with 
you and appreciate all of your advice. I am not totally unhappy with the 
recruiting part of my job, I just feel that I do not "buy into" everything 
that is happening in my group. There are many necessary changes that are 
needed and I feel that the program is heading in an excellent direction. I 
just want to get into more of a sales oriented part of Enron because I feel 
that my strength is selling. I would like to at least get an interview with 
Enron Broadband because I know that they are filling up there retail sales 
groups. Although I do not have all the technical experience, I know people 
who have gone over there with no technical or no sales experience. As you 
know, it is who you know and I do not have a relationship with David Cox or 
any of the
retail folks in broadband. I was hoping that you would give David a call and 
see if he could at least give me an interview in one of the retail groups. 
Brent has called over to David and I feel if you were to call also, it would 
help.
 Sally, let me know if this will be ok and I would like to get on your 
calendar to discuss further. Nobody in my group knows that I am looking for 
another job so please keep this confidential. I can not tell  how much I 
value your opinion and advice in matters especially  like these. Thank you so 
much and I look forward 
to hearing from you soon.
   George Hope

Sally,

Chris Hanz has blocked his entire day out today for technology recruiting - 
therefore he said that he would be able to meet with John from 1:30 - 2:00 
just before a recruiting event for office visits at 2:00.  Therefore, Lexi is 
going to bring and pick up both Chris Hoyle and John Rodgers as indicated 
below:

Chris Hoyle  EB1812  11:00 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
John Rodgers  EB1812  1:30 p.m. - 2:00 p.m.

Thanks!
Ashley

Chris to the 18th floor and pick him up at 11:30.  I am still trying to

Subject: Re: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns =20

Sally,

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
"spring" internships.

The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join Enron.  =20

The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for "summer" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=
=20
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=
=20
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=
=20
support your efforts.

I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20
frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20
manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i=
f=20
you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20

Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20
interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

Charlene

Sally:

I just received a reminder from Ted Jacobs that the AAPL Scholarship 
interviews will be held on Tuesday, March 6 on campus from 8-5 pm.  I am 
currently making arrangements to go.  I understand that your schedule is 
incredibly tight, but if you will be able to attend that day, please let me 
know.

Please also note that the awards banquet will be held April 20 (6-9 pm), 
should you be interested in that as well.  I also plan to attend this event.

Thank you,

Lexi

I would like to thank everyone for participating in the first Wellesley Team 
Meeting.  I regret the delay in processing the minutes.  The career placement 
center has been really busy and I needed to contact them to get some of the 
questions answered from the meeting.  For those of you who were unable to 
attend, I have listed the topics of discussion:

Goals for Wellesley - Hiring goal of 4 (not limited to)
Analyst Program changes - Structure ( Team Leaders), Developmental Program, 2 
day interview process
Interview Training Workshop - Everyone that will be interviewing is required 
to attend a 2 hour session
Roles and Responsibilities - Role of team members, Participation is tracked 
for PRC recognition.
Wellesley Campus Plan
 - We discussed the presentation time being pushed back.  I was able to get 
it pushed back to 5:00  o'clock at the latest.  There are other companies 
scheduled to present on that date and that was the  latest time we coud get.  
There will be no class conflicts on that date (September 28, 2000).   We  
discussed the attire for the presentation being casual (jeans).  That concept 
was  proposed to the  career placement center Assistant (Bernice Tita) and 
she said that casual attire will be well received.   We would need to just 
indicate it when we publicize the event.
 - We discussed changing the interview dates due to scheduling conflicts.  
The dates that we were  able to get were November 20th and 21st. 
 - We discussed possible recruiting at neighboring schools(Smith & Mt. Holy 
Oke)
 - We discussed taking the company jet to some or all the events, especially 
when we will be   involving recruiting efforts at the neighboring schools.
Target Groups -  Economic Student Board Association, All majors

I have forwarded the Wellesley recruiting guide to those of you who were 
unable to attend.  If you have not received it by now, please contact me and 
I will get one to you a.s.a.p.

I have meetings scheduled with Jean Mrha and Cindy Olson to work on the 
participants for the events and afterwards I will get the revised campus plan 
to the team.  If you have any questions regarding the contents of this e-mail 
or other Wellesley recruiting questions, feel free to contact me at any time.

Thanks, Geynille





Thanks a million, 

Geynille

Rick and Sally

I told the scholarship winners that within the next few weeks, we would like to meet with them for lunch or dinner  before the semester is over.  So since we are on the subject, do you have plans to be in Austin any time soon?  I will coordinate the students around your schedule.  Also, if you think there are others that should join the smaller luncheon/dinner, let me know.  I thought about asking Traci Warner and Billy Lemmons since they are new to the AA program.

Karen

Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their being chosen.  --Sally

Greetings, UT Recruiting Team!

Each of you has been chosen to represent Enron for our Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at the University of Texas.  As part of the team, you will be 
challenged with choosing the best candidates from UT to join our Analyst

Our first campus event will be on Monday, August 21 and interviews will be

Program, and discuss the fall recruiting calendar.  To that end, please

I will notify you once the team meeting date is set.  

I look forward to meeting you all soon.

Sincerely,

Dear UT Team Members:

We are in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been 
extended.  In order to ensure our cultivation efforts I have assigned each of 
you to one or more candidates to contact weekly, beginning this week.  

By taking "ownership" you will create a more personal relationship with your 
candidate(s) and help us to stay abreast of any questions or concerns they 
may have.

Please keep me posted regarding these cultivation efforts so that no one is 
left out.

Thanks again for all your work and participation!  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Dear OU Team Members:

As many of you know, we will have a group of 58 OU JCPenney Leadership 
students and 10 Texas A&M Fellows students come to Enron Friday afternoon for 
a Corporate View.

I have attached a copy of the agenda for the afternoon and still need 8-10 
volunteers for lunch.  Please let me know if you can attend.  We will have 
several large tables set up and would like to have at least 1 Enron 
representative at each table to facilitate conversation.  

The group will depart from Houston by approximately 3:45 to head for College 
Station for the BIG GAME!!!!!

Thank you in advance for your help.  Please don't hesitate to call if you 
have any questions.



Thank you!

As you might be aware,  Susan Scott (the book admin for the pipe option book) 
was forced by system problems to stay all night Wednesday night and until 200 
am Friday  in order to calc my book.  While she is scheduled to rotate to the 
West desk soon,  I think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in 
order to bring the work load to a sustainable level.  I'd like to meet at 
2:30 pm on Monday to discuss this issue.  Please let me know if this time 
fits in your schedules.

Thanks,

Larry

Lexi,
I have a concern regarding the summer internship position....
I am president of my sorority at OU and because of my obligations to it, I
have to be back in Norman by the 23 of July, making my last day of a summer
job the 20th of July.  I did notice that the summer analyst program is 12
weeks long and I wouldn't be able to work  a full 12 weeks.
The dates I am available are May 14-July 20.  I don't know if this presents
a problem, but I wanted to check with you.  I would really like to take the
offer if these circumstances were okay.  But I do understand otherwise. If
you could let me know as soon as possible I would appreciate it!!
Thanks so much.
Whittney Skinner

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20

years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
"spring" internships.

The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join Enron.  =20

The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for "summer" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=
=20
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=
=20
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=
=20
support your efforts.

I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20
frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20
manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i=
f=20
you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20

Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20
interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

Dear Sally,
It was a pleasure to meet with you on Tuesday, April 4 at UT to discuss my
qualifications for the Enron Scholarship.  It is a great honor to be
nominated for an award that is regarded so highly here in the business
school.  I believe as a nominee, and hopefully as a recipient, that I can
uphold the values that are at the core of Enron's business.
Again, thank you for the opportunity to share my ideas with you.  I look
forward to hearing the outcome.
Also, could you please pass along Gene's email address as well.  I am
assuming it is similar to yours, but I just wanted to make sure.
Sincerely,

Jason Ware

their status.  Their invitation letters will be sent shortly thereafter.

Thanks!

Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Irfan Iqbal

Dear Ms Beck

Thank you for taking your time to interview me for the Enron MBA Excellence Scholarship today.  Through our conversation, I have learnt more about your firm and experienced firsthand how its corporate values are embodied in you and your colleagues.  Given a chance, I would also love to hear more about your area of work.  It sounds to me like a field that I am very interested in.  I am currently taking a second-year class on Derivatives and Risk Management.

I am still in the process of locating a summer job and would really appreciate it if you could give me some feedback on my interview performance.  It would be very helpful to me.

It was a pleasure meeting you and I hope you enjoyed your brief visit back to UT.

Warm regards 
Soo Pang Tang

Dear Karen, 

Thank you again for including me in your group of finalists for the Enron Scholarship.  Enron's commitment to community service and education is most admirable, I and felt honored to be selected (particularly considering the other people chosen).  I even enjoyed the interview experience, mostly because of the neat interviewers.

I also appreciate the prompt replies to all correspondence, as well as the follow-up call this evening (even if the news was not quite what I wanted to hear).  It's great to see people "doing it right".  If you need any assistance with future events at UT, please don't hesitate to call.

Lynett and Cindy:

Greetings from Houston!

I have a special request for you.  In order for us to prepare our campus
recruiting strategy for next fall, I need information regarding
internship
recruiting.

As you know, we decided to concentrate our spring 2001 effort on intern
recruiting and interviewing.  In order for us to ensure that we are
being
effective with this strategy, I need to know which companies interviewed
for summer interns during the fall 2000 recruiting season.  Companies of
particular interest would be El Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Duke, consulting
firms such as McKinsey, and Big 5 accounting firms.

By providing this information, you would greatly assist our effort for
upcoming years.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Lexi Elliott

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns


While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

Certainly understand the tradition you have with OU/Texas and it would be
hard. I imagine David is starting to feel a little cocky, given we should be
undefeated going into Texas, but he may still need to seek the shelter of
the study, as I know Texas is not going to roll over and play dead.

Sounds like Meagan has a full agenda this Fall and a trip to Norman would
only get in the way. I'm sure David will not let the fire die, if she is
truly interested in OU. FYI, OU's Spring Break is March 17-25 next year. So
you can plan accordingly. Let me know if you decide when you decide to come
up and I can get you lined up with Prospective Student Services for a tour.
Also, I remember you telling me about your concerns about grades. I know
that OU requires a 24 on the ACT, or finish in the top 1/3 of your
graduating class. It is my understanding that will soon be increasing to 26
or top 30% of graduating class. Looks like OU is following UT on tightening
entrance requirements.

I can get you shirts caps, sweatshirts, etc. for OU, UT and Tech. You can go
to Bigtimesports.com and look at the styles. I think they are also in the
school colors. If you see a style you like, let me know the size shape and
school and I can order it. If some of it is for you, let me know, as they
have different styles for women. Also, I can have logo's etc. reduced (like
I did on your Bevo on your shirt) so they are not so big. I always have them
reduce the OU from 1 3/4" to a
1 1/4" size, so I don't look like a "poster boy" for OU. Anyway, let me know
and I will order them for you.

Let me know when you hear back from Lexi about your discussion relative to
summer internship recruiting.

Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.  With the ages of the
kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our
home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that
up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of
Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second
cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate
party!)

We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on
that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the
football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that
we may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on
the drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to
Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the
spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with
Meagan.

We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you
have a list of what is available for those schools?

Thanks for the nice words. I hope Enron will be able to look at some
students for summer internships, as I am sure they will be gone by Spring.

As far as Texas tickets go, I can come up with 5 singles, but not 5
together
or even 3 and 2. Let me know if interested and I will try to get them.
Might
be able to trade up or something.

Let me know what other schools you are talking about and I can find out for
you.

Again, thank you for taking time out your schedule to come up and be a part
of the OU recruiting effort. It has been your support and efforts that we
have to thank for Enron coming to OU. Keep me posted on what you work out
with HR with regards to summer interns.

It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I
appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.
I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody
and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have
done a great job in changing and promoting the program.

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware
of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully
with a change in our strategy!

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets
may already be sold.

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know
-- we can probably place a few orders through you!

Dear Ms Beck 
Thank you for taking your time to interview me for the Enron MBA Excellence Scholarship today.  Through our conversation, I have learnt more about your firm and experienced firsthand how its corporate values are embodied in you and your colleagues.  Given a chance, I would also love to hear more about your area of work.  It sounds to me like a field that I am very interested in.  I am currently taking a second-year class on Derivatives and Risk Management.
I am still in the process of locating a summer job and would really appreciate it if you could give me some feedback on my interview performance.  It would be very helpful to me.
It was a pleasure meeting you and I hope you enjoyed your brief visit back to UT. 
Warm regards 
Soo Pang Tang
