Mark, per your request I've copied Jim Coffey and Troy Denetsosie.

I will work with legal and El Paso to set up a GISB agreement.

I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.

Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?

Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.

I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60.

Dear Mark:  I'm helping Barbara Gray with the finalization of the GISB with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.

Barbara has approved El Paso's requested changes, Exhibit "B," and she will initial the document when it is in final form.  Please send me the info on Enron Compression Services that I'll need to fill in the front left side of the GISB.  I don't have their document in electronic form, but I hope that you do. 

Many thanks,

Chris,
I've got calls into the counterparty that has been buying our TW gas month-to-month.
I don't have any market information to work the transaction.  I need to either have 
someone sell this gas on ECS's behalf or to provide me with a market perspective.
I've got a few others that I'll approach about purchasing this gas.  Any ideas or
contacts for West Texas or Permian gas?

I would like to get another GISB set up with Reliant with the following Enron information:

Name:			Enron Compression Services Company
Address		1400 Smith St.
			Houston, Texas 77002

Contact			Mark Knippa
Phone			713-853-3463
Fax		`	713-646-3702

Dunns #		072773547

Would you guys send me a new contract when you get a chance please?

Pete, I would like to get this set up to "sell" gas to Reliant under this legal entity name.  I've already sold gas to another party for May so there isn't a rush on this.

Thanks

Do I need to do something about this?  Who is nominating this or where did you get the gas, is it a buy/sell?  Just curious...I was out yesterday.

Mark, per your request I've copied Jim Coffey and Troy Denetsosie.

I will work with legal and El Paso to set up a GISB agreement.

I sold 3,253 dth per day of  Florida Zone 3 gas at $3.60 to Bob Crites (713-420-2499) at El Paso effective 4/3/02 - 4/30/02.  I'm leaving this deal out of Sitara because its an Enron Compressor Services deal, not ENA.

Kay, I need to send a GISB agreement as Enron Compressor Services to El Paso.  Would you work on that?

Mark, I'm not sure who at Enron to notify about this deal.  You and I can chat about that later.

I only asked for 2 bids for the April gas.  Reliant showed me a bid of $3.58 and El Paso shoed me a bid of $3.60.
