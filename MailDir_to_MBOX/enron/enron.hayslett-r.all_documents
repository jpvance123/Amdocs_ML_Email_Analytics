Attached is a Word version of the draft issues chart that Bruce Neely 
forwarded last night.  This is a document you can print and read.  We may be 
getting a more refined Word version of this chart from LeBoeuf later today.  
The Native Load Analysis should also be received today.

Beth, if you know of a safe way to transmit this on to Ron today, I would 
appreciate your doing so.

Rod-

Thanks for your assistance.  I've gotten good feedback on your inputs from 
our Wessex folks.  Ultimately, I want to bill your costs into a transaction 
account that we have at Wessex.  I'll check on the procedure today and let 
you know asap.  Thanks.

I'm not sure what you have heard back from the crew in Bristol/Bath, but I 
found them to be very interested in achieving maximum success.    There was a 
lot of learning on my part, but I'm now more convinced than ever that Wessex 
is very much like our gas pipeline business.    Even to the fact that the 
internal regulatory types don't believe the regulators will approve it.     I 
have offered continuing assistance as needed (in fact have a conference call 
setup for tomorrow).    I was able to give them the benefit of my experiences 
and tried to create analogies to our experiences here.   In some cases I'm 
sure it made a difference, in others the group may actually be in front of 
some of our thinking.    I think I can see an opportunity to expand the 
thinking on both sides of "the pond" in the regulated businesses  with just 
some simple contacts and have promised to help them at least start 
conversations with more counterparts in the pipeline group.    

Let me know how you want me to charge you the travel costs.     I can submit 
the claim here and bill you or I can submit the claim to you.

will be accounting for it.  She will need access to the FERC account

Libby

The error correction mechanism was put in at your request.

The whole point is that it protects both sides.  It protects assetCo & EngCo 
from being ripped off by either side as gain / pain after a given point is 
shared.  It also protects EngCo from AssetCo getting a bad regulatory deal or 
mis-specifying a project - your point about Bath tunnel.

The down side is that it blunts incentives if the trigger point for error 
correction is too close to the target cost.

Note also that packages of work are to be let.  This diversifies the risk of 
rip-off / poor estimation.

    Keith,

    Looking again at the payment terms included below -- the terms for 
Contracting
    at Risk for the Engco are different from what was agreed at GMT & what  
is the
    norm in the industry.  Was your proposal something you've seen elsewhere 
-- if
    so, please can you let us see the contract.?

    In the latest proposal  Engco take all the pain/gain for X % around the 
target,
    and  the pain/gain sharing happens above/below  X % of the target.   This 
is at
    odds with  what normally happens -- usually the client  would work up a 
target
    cost with the contractor, & then there would be a pain/gain share split 
from
    that target onwards. Sometimes there is a cap to the risk carried by one 
of the
    parties.

    The problem with the proposal below is that AssetCo is setting the cost , 
and I
    assume the scope  & programme.   And then asking Engco to take the risk 
that
    AssetCo's estimate is realistic.   We would end up with endless arguments
    between the parties as to the details of the scope -- because that is 
the  way
    that Engco  would make its money.    How would AssetCo be incentivised to 
be
    accurate in the estimating  , if errors to X % are picked up by Engco.

    I am assuming of course that you would be setting the estimates at the 13%
    saving assumed in the Internal Business Plan, which we all acknowledge is 
going
    to be hard to achieve.

    I think we need quite a bit of work on this area --  I suggest we set up a
    sub-group to work through the details of how the Engco payment terms 
would work,
    for the Contracting Risk option.  Are you OK with this suggestion?

My comments on the analyses (DCF models only):

Exchange DCF Analysis

Capital costs for years 1-3 are spent in year 0 (in years 0-2 maybe more 
appropriate)
Capital Avoidance is treated as expense savings (it is added to the total 
expensed cost)
No depreciation is considered for the capital cost
No income tax is considered for the operating cost savings

Cynet DCF Analysis looks OK except for Cash Flow Section: Should change 
"LESS" to "ADD" AMORT/DEPRECIATION

Mark Russ will be representing Michael Ratner at the PRC on 12/12 and 12/13.  
I am looking into the pre-ranking meeting that is supposedly going on now.  
However, the Associate Analyst program indicated that this was a pre-ranking 
for Associates within EBS.  Please provide your feedback to Mark before the 
PRC on 12/12 and 12/13.

Rod,  

The PRC process closed last week.  You should have received information 
regarding representing your associates/analysts at a meeting to be held on 
the 28th of this month.  If not, you should check with the Associate/Analysts 
or HR for this information.

After the pre-ranking meeting, then you should submit the ranking and your 
evaluation to Mark for the final Corporate ranking.

Thanks.

Rod - see me comment directly to Dan below.
FYI - We will probably book the income in December since the transaction was 
consummated in a 24hour period in December.  (I may need to bring a more 
reality/pragmatic focus into our accounting theory personnel).
OK?

TW purchased a swap, exchanged a floating 2002 position for a fixed price.  
It was purchased at current market so there is no profit until the 2002 strip 
changes in value.  Since this derivative has been designated as a hedge of 
2002 all changes in market value are deferred in OCI (effective 1/1/01).

It represents a hedge of 2002 forecasted sales of TW over-retained 
fuel/unaccounted for volumes.  The swap will be initially recorded in January 
2001 at then market value as a FAS 133 implementation adjustment (any value 
at 1/1/2001 will go to income as an item of "change in accounting 
principles").   Monthly fluctuations in the value of the swap will be marked 
to market with the income effect deferred in Other Comprehensive Income until 
the hedged item (the physical sale) occurs.  The the deferred income will be 
undeferred and brought to income to offset the income/loss from the hedged 
transaction.

possible:

Number of work spaces by category:
 Office
 Cubicle/work station - high walls
 Cubicle/work station - low walls

Number of additional work spaces (visitors, auditors, etc.)

Number of Conference/Team Rooms:
 Small (4-6 person)
 Medium (7-12 person)
 Large (more than 12 - please specify)

File Rooms: Specify the linear footage of file space required and/or list 
special requirements for maps, etc.

Special:  Model Office
  Computer Rooms/Cold Rooms
  Map Tables and/or walls
  Writable walls
  Video Conference Equipment/Connections
  Other

Also, please identify one person from your organization that can be used for 
coordination purposes. For instance, Rod Hayslett will assign Kathy Campos 
for his section.

Thanks for your help in this effort!

Attached is a draft of  2001 Objectives.  I have not yet had the opportunity 
to sit down with Dave Neubauer and his direct reports and probably won't 
until after the holidays.  I will update the objectives at that time.

 I have not included some of the standard objectives (e.g. "prepare current 
estimate") but have tried to keep the statements  at a higher level.

Let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss.

The 2001 Global Technology costs have been finalized.  As communicated in 
mid-October, IT operating and development costs have increased relative to 
2000 due to Enron's tremendous growth, e-commerce strategies, and expanded IT

business unit for IT Infrastructure, IT Development, and IT e-Commerce 
initiatives:


   2001 Plan
IT Infrastructure  $ 6,594
IT Development $
IT e-Commerce  $              
                  $ 6,594

We believe it will be done the 14th.  There is some discussion about having 
that group first, but not sure that will be approved by Hannon and Rice.  It 
is again being held at the 4 Seasons.

Kilmer stopped in to discuss where we are on the by Land portion of the 
phases VI thru whatever study.  Crux of our discussion is that we need a 
sit-down with you because our minds have blanked as to what Stan specifically 
wanted. 


I have run the numbers and I think I now have the cases on an apples and 
apples basis.  To do this I had to actually go out thru Phase X, 
extrapolating with Tom P's assistance.  I  thought I would have a little 
writeup by this PM, but I am not going to make it. I did want to get this 
note out so that we could get on your calendar.  In a nutshell, the levelized 
rate for land ends up being about 10% or so higher than that for sea based on 
our beliefs about the future market.  Build up faster and sea becomes more 
favorable while land is unchanged.   At any rate, I'll try to get something 
together in the AM, at least the graphs which I already have. (Tho I'm not 
sure I can explain it on paper.)

Rolling 4 quarters estimate for income and cash

Less focus legal entity, more focus functional groups

Detail quarterly reviews/current estimates for O & M and functional groups

TW needs new financial modeling tool to analyze market data

Focus functional groups on ETS bottom line not just their group/company

Consistency in policies, procedures, schedules, accounting methodology, etc. 
across functions

If I think of others, I will send them.

Subject: 2001 Goals & Objectives

I would like each of you to submit, up the chain of command,  a list (not to 
exceed) 10 items (but at least 3) that you believe  need to be accomplished 
in the year 2001.     Some of these can be group goals and some may be 
personal to you and some may be personal to others in the group.      Some 
may even belong to another group.    I am looking for ideas that will improve 
our organizations, that will improve us, and that will potentially improve 
Enron.    Any and all ideas are desired, and things that relate to Stan's 
list are more than welcome.     I would like ideas by early next week as we 
are trying to get draft input/ideas into Stan before the Holidays.

Speaking of the Holidays, I would like each of you to get to Kathy your 
vacation/"out of the office" schedule over the next several weeks.     I 
would like contact phone numbers and to know who is your substitute if you 
are out and unreachable.   Kathy will publish a list after she gets every 
one's input.

Thanks.

Rod:

Attached is a PBA nomination for your approval.  This one is for Bobbie 
LaChapelle who has basically molded and created this new data analyst 
position within the department.   She has blazed the trail for others to 
follow and transition into a higher level of employee.   Her work is helping 
us in attempting to identify and correct more measurement data as it comes in 
from the Field RTUs.   This effort goes a long way in enhancing customer 
service levels and is especially value added work.

Attached is a contract approval memo for the purchase agreement with Cooper.  
It may be more detailed than is common.  I wanted you to take a look at it 
before I showed it to anyone else.  I also was not sure who all needed to 
sign it.

Let me know what you think.

They will be doing a lot of  maintenance activity at the plant this month.  
Unfortunately, much of the key material needed to do the full turnaround 
needs several months lead time.  For example, we have already ordered the 
catalyst for the turnaround scheduled in March.  We discussed this yesterday 
with David Bush, the plant manager, and he said they would do what they could 
in December, but the critical path items would not be available until closer 
to March.  

The MTBE plant will be going down December 15th and the maintenance (spooge 
clean up) has been accelerated so we can come back up in Mid January to take 
advantage of an expected increase in MTBE margins.

As far as longer term shut down considerations go, no one seems to have a 
good grasp on what the methanol market will do.  Obviously, domestic 
production will be curtailed which should lift prices.  If prices rise and 
January gas prices fall back below $6.00, then we would probably come back up 
in January.  Regarding staffing effort, particularly in my group, the 
shutdown does not significantly impact the accountants and with a high 
vacation time and year-end coming up, their plates are pretty full.  At the 
plant, the purchasers, contract administrator and A/P folks will actually be 
busier trying to get materials  and contracts for both outages settled, 
especially with the timing change for the MTBE outage.

Let me know if you want to discuss this further.

Subject: Re: Methanol Plant Shut Down  

Thanks.     I think we need to be looking at the "accelerating of the 
maintenance" question as well.   If there is a possibility that the economic 
world has changed and there will be a longer shut down of the facilities, 
does it make sense to do that work now?      What are the decision points 
that we need to have information on in order to make that determination?     
Should we set up a small group to come up with an answer to this 
question?      Should we also be looking at what we could do to reduce the 
staffing by reassigning some of the people to other things and minimizing the 
effort expended against Clean Fuels, particularly in your group?

FYI only - We are shutting the methanol plant down for the month and are 
selling the natural gas back for $7.73.

Rod,

I would like to pass along my appreciation for the excellent assistance Pam 
has provided my group related to our contract file room renovation project.  
She has been quite creative in suggesting improvements to our physical layout 
and has been able to obtain timely results in her discussions with the 
facilities group.  Her involvement has saved us a lot of time.

I just checked on the construction in EB4159, and it looks like they have not 
done anything about the wiring for the wall phone that's supposed to move 
across the room to EB4159-C  in this Friday evening's churn. Would you please 
check to make sure the change was made on the plans for us? 

Also, I just heard they are planning to put a desktop copier and a fax 
machine on one end of the work surface. I don't know if anyone has done a 
churn request on an existing fax machine, or if a new one will be purchased, 
but we probably should confirm there are enough ports and power to handle the 
additional fax line, along with Victoria Martinez (x3-1953) phone, LAN, etc. 
She's on Friday's churn to go into EB4159-A. 

I've attached a copy of our churn request for your information.



You may have already handled all this, I'm just double-checking. Please let 
me know if you need any additional information, or if you run into any 
problems. Thanks for all your help on this (and many others!) project.

Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such 
should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen 
nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC 
on that date, out of the office.

Subject: Re: Space Planning

To begin the process of thinking about what is needed to plan our space for 
the future, we need to pull together some very simple information from each 
of you.   Please provide the following to Rod Hayslett or to me as soon as 
possible:

Number of work spaces by category:
 Office
 Cubicle/work station - high walls
 Cubicle/work station - low walls

Number of additional work spaces (visitors, auditors, etc.)

Number of Conference/Team Rooms:
 Small (4-6 person)
 Medium (7-12 person)
 Large (more than 12 - please specify)

File Rooms: Specify the linear footage of file space required and/or list 
special requirements for maps, etc.

Special:  Model Office
  Computer Rooms/Cold Rooms
  Map Tables and/or walls
  Writable walls
  Video Conference Equipment/Connections
  Other

Also, please identify one person from your organization that can be used for 
coordination purposes. For instance, Rod Hayslett will assign Kathy Campos 
for his section.

Thanks for your help in this effort!

I would think we can do the same as we do in Florida, which is similar to 
your suggestion.     We did create a non-regulated affiliate to do the 
business in the name of, but that leaves the revenue in the venture and 
solves the fiduciary problem.

Subject: Re: O&M Fees at Interconnects  

For O&M fees at interconnects NBPL has been charging the customer an 
estimated incremental cost, which under the cost of service tariff was 
credited back to O&M (where the incremental costs were originally charged).  
We are definitely going to change this now.

In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining 
a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been 
involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).  In that case, a 
small amount of O&M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.  

In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on 
NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the 
amounts be left at NBPL.  The main reasons are accounting ease, avoidance of 
fiduciary issues, and customer relations.

Subject: Re: O&M Fees at Interconnects

In other similar situations where Operations has had an opportunity to 
provide a service for a fee, we have been looking to EAMR as the entity to do 
the work.  Does the NBPL sitiuation preclude EAMR from taking on this role?  
I would assume, unless there has been a change, that given the fact that NBPL 
does not have any employees it would be difficult for NBPL to provide the 
service.

Subject: O&M Fees at Interconnects

The issue of O&M fees at new interconnects has been raised by several 
customers.  A meeting to discuss this issue and how Operations will determine 
these fees, is scheduled for Monday, December 18, on your calendar.  Your 
input is very important at this meeting.

Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue 
and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.  NBPL has been asked 
to renegotiate fees (PGL&C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1 
year (Harvest States).  NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of 
line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).  We need to 
agree on a decision from both a business and an operations perspective.  
Currently, we have estimated operating fees at interconnects where we charge 
a fee and charge a standard monthly fee of $2,000 per month with the 
exception of two interconnects.  With the tariff changes, operating fees will 
not automatically be recovered in the future.  How are these operating fees 
going to be tracked and charged?  Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers 
the same fee?  Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a 
cost of doing business?  These questions need to be answered at the meeting.

Thanks!

Hi Rod

Hope things are going ok.

Just wanted to drop you a note about any job opportunities that might come up 
that  might fit me. Cindi and I have been out a long time (5 years) and we 
are looking to get back. I have a year left on my contract but if the right 
opportunity came along I would like to consider it. I thought I would start 
now eventhough I have a year left. I am definitely not going to renew my 
contract again. 

thanks

mike

Maggie and Walt Schroeder, together with big sister Claire,
take pleasure in announcing the birth of Brian Christopher on
June 15, 2000, at 2:02 PM.  He weighed in at 5 lbs. 14 oz.
and was 18
 inches long.  Mom and Dad are still in a state
of shock, and have already forgotten what a good night of
sleep is.  Claire is acting like a two year old and has claimed
Brian as MINE! MINE! MINE!

Subject: Proposal to Caithness Big Sandy

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Jim, gave an excellent start.

Commercial Support group:
Develop a format to best compare the volumes, margins and applicable expenses 
of 2001 Actual and Current Estimates/Forecasts to 2001 Plan to 2000 Actual 
for use by Danny McCarty as a Commercial GOAL.

Identify potential areas to monetize contracts or assets where feasible.

Improve Citrus/FGT Cash Flow forecasting by utilizing SAP as much as possible.

FYI:  I participated in Super Saturday (12/9/00; very interesting).

With the realignment of ETS, we want to remind you of the procedures for 
booking company aircraft service.  As you probably know, one Enron plane has 
been designated for use by ETS for travel between Houston and Omaha and for 
other trips as approved by the vice presidents or us.  Of course, a key 
consideration for approval is the number of passengers, which generally is a 
minimum of 4 - 6, and/or the difficulty of reaching the destination(s) by 
commercial airlines.  The plane is booked on a first come, first served 
basis.  To encourage maximum utilization of the plane, a weekly schedule is 
published and distributed to ETS support team members each week.

Virginia O'Neill coordinates the plane schedule and will continue to do so 
for all trips originating from Omaha.  In addition, we have begun utilizing 
charter aircraft service for trips originating from Omaha within a mileage 
range of 700 - 800 miles.  The utilization of charters for these trips will 
reduce travel costs by eliminating deadhead costs.  Virginia will continue to 
coordinate charter trips from Omaha also.  Beginning today, Julie Armstrong 
will coordinate trips originating from Houston.  Julie and Virginia will work 
together to continue publishing the weekly plane schedule so that travelers 
can utilize the plane when available.   Please remember that company plane 
usage requires the approval of your vice president.  If employees are 
reserving individual available seats on a scheduled flight, vice presidential 
approval isn't required.

If space is available, personal travel for employees and their immediate 
families is permitted.  Imputed income for the cost of the flight will be 
included in the employee's W-2 form at the end of the year.  Please remember 
that personal travelers are always subject to being bumped up to departure 
time by business travelers and that the schedule is subject to frequent 
change.

Please have the following information available when contacting Julie or 
Virginia to book a flight:

 Date of travel & destination  
Lead passenger's name
Other passenger's names (generally need 4 - 6 passengers)
Departure & return times
Ground transportation requirements (if rental cars are required, 
please have the individual's American Express number or Emerald Isle number 
available).
 Purpose of the trip
 Coding if the trip is being charged to a work order

We will continue to monitor usage of the company plane to maximize its usage 
and provide needed private aircraft service for ETS.  In addition, we expect 
that, except for NBPL, the actual aircraft usage cost will be billed directly 
to the user's cost center in year 2001.  However, the billing details are 
still being worked out and will be communicated when finalized.  If you have 
questions or comments, you may contact either of us or Julie or Virginia.

Lou-I think you might want to meet the folks from Louisiana that are 
considering buying the Sunniland oil fields and want us to put it back into 
service.  They make a compelling case.  Their company president is in town 
for other business and he and his two top people have this slot available to 
meet.  I'll get a room and let you know the location as soon as I know.

Rod,  to my knowledge the Commission has not specifically defined what is de 
minimus.   The working definition of an Operating Unit or System is taken 
from an Office of the Chief Accountant Interpretative Letter issued  May 26, 
1961.  "The principal tests are amount of investment, character of the 
property acquired, and continuity of operation.  The following have been 
deemed to be operating units or systems: a large compressor station, a 
processing plant, an important measuring station, a gathering system or 
important segment thereof,  a transmission line or important segment.  If the 
transaction involves such a small amount of property as to be de minimus, it 
need not be considered as an operating unit."  If a customer is attached to 
the facilities to be sold it is considered prima facie evidence that the 
property is an operating unit or system.

In a July 8, 1992, the NNG Rate department in an interoffice memorandum 
regarding the Definition of an Operating Units or System noted "The 
Commission has not specifically defined de minimus, however, based on past 
rulings we can assume that the investment must be something less than $9 
million, or a pipeline less than 7.586 miles."

The 1.091 miles of 6" pipe and Faribault TBS #1 and the Northfield 4" 
branchlines of 4.9 miles and TBS have a net book value of $57,712. 

My main concern, if we use the de minimus rationale, are we not setting a 
precedent in which future sales or acquisitions will have to be viewed?  Some 
of those future de minimus sales could involve gains! 

Again, it is not clear how the Commission will make its determination.  The 
downside, if the Commission rejects our argument, NNG will have a $ 58K loss 
on the sale of these assets.

I think an argument can be made that the amount is de minimus which leads to 
a non-operating unit designation.

Gary:  Are you OK with the non-operating unit assumption based on deminimus

If you're OK with it and the lawyers are OK, then it must be OK for me.

Attached is a  "Asset Divestiture Approval Form" for the sale of the 
Faribault Minnesota branchline location # 83801 consisting of 1.091 miles of 
6" pipe and the Faribault TBS#1 and the Northfield branchlines location No.'s 
85001 and 85002 consisting of approximately 4.9 miles of 4" pipe, and the 
Northfield TBS#1.  



Please indicate your approval or rejection of this proposal on the approval 
form and return to either James Centilli (EB4250) or David Waymire (OMA0755) 
by 5PM Monday, November 27th.  If you have questions or concerns, please 
contact James Centilli (853-5028) or myself (398-7062).

These branchlines are experiencing heavy encroachment.  The Faribault 
branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in 
order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized 
gas because of the population density along the pipeline.  

There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines.  There is an 
estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense, 
exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure 
branchline odorization.

The net book value of these facilities is $57,712.  The facilities will be 
sold for $1.  In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year 
transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000.  

The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as 
to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and  will 
be treated as a non-operating unit.  This will allow the undepreciated 
balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves.

The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the 
main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000.

I do not see why not.  I would prefer that we have shipped the computers 
before there is any announcement.  Do you have an exact date?  If your 
announcement is before we actually ship the computers, which hopefully will 
be this week, then I would just say something like NALMP has established a 
new relationship with Enron Transportation Services, the pipeline subsidiary 
of the Enron Corporation.  If your announcement is after we ship then I would 
feel more comfortable mentioning some of the details.

Let me know what you think.

Rod:

Certainly some of the goals and objectives from me and my group will be:

1.     Support and participation in meeting or exceeding operating company 
goals for UAF figures.  (note these have not been finalized yet so no numbers 
are in place)

2.     Support of project work and successful implementation of the new 
measurement system (PGAS)

3.     Continued support in the finalization or any ongoing projects involved 
with Gas Measurement Continuous Improvement

4.     Maintain or improve accuracy rates for GMS data to the Operating 
Companies from the current levels of 99% on station accuracy and 98% on total 
gross MMBtu processed.

The attached model has the RAROC and COS model in the various spreadsheet.  
The rates I gave on the matrix and the COS rate track for the 500 MMBTU/d 
expansion at the $613,500M unleveraged.  We would experience negative 
depreciation for the first five years of the project.  Under the 70/30 debt 
equity scenario we would have a rate about $.58 and that tracks with the DCF 
model, and we would have escalating depreciation rates over the term of the 
project.

Rod - I have not been specifically requested, but if you are asked here's my 
input on selected folks whom I interfaced with on SAP.

Melissa Becker -Excellent; Delivered "80%+" of a huge project!

Mark Schmidt -Excellent; Solid technical skills; experienced; responsive to 
Business Units (BU)

Kathy Kokas -Excellent; solid technical skills; thoughtful; service oriented 
(but too much enterprise orientation versus BU sensitive)

Susan Bellinhausen -Strong; Has worked hard to deliver a myriad of reports 
for users; solid attitude under pressure.

Emitra Nelson -Issues; Long on talk, short on delivery; unable to effectively 
produce needed SAP reports in a timely and responsive manner

Rudy Elizando -Need Improvement; turned out to NOT be the best 
depreciation/FERC resource. Prone to talk; evasive;
short on quality delivery.

Rod,

Following my voice-mail to you, here is an e-mail from Dan Stockrahm of ANR 
(its got his e-mail address) advising his outside counsel, Rhonda Chandler, 
that he thinks any intervention by us would be counter-productive.  I'm sorry 
I don't have Stockrahm's telephone number or office address.

Rod,
 Per your request this morning, it turns out you can't swing a dead cougar 
around here in GPG HR without hitting a U of H grad!  
 Kristin Passmore, an HR Assistant whom you may not have met yet, as well as 
Estalee and Laura all are University of Houston graduates in good standing.  
(Well, Laura barely is in good standing, but I'll let her be the one to tell 
you all about that.)  In addition, Miranda Southard, a student learner in our 
department, will be a senior this Fall at U of H. 
 Each of these good people has expressed an interest in helping you with any 
recruiting efforts directed at U of H alumni.  
 
  d.s.

For O&M fees at interconnects NBPL has been charging the customer an 
estimated incremental cost, which under the cost of service tariff was 
credited back to O&M (where the incremental costs were originally charged).  
We are definitely going to change this now.

In at least one situation in the past, NPNG had the contract for maintaining 
a short lateral for the Synfuels plant in ND (in fact Phil may have been 
involved with this when he was District Manager in Glasgow).  In that case, a 
small amount of O&M was left at NPNG and the revenue was booked at NPNG.  

In most cases the customer is negotiating the fees as a part of service on 
NBPL and I would suggest that unless these are significant contracts the 
amounts be left at NBPL.  The main reasons are accounting ease, avoidance of 
fiduciary issues, and customer relations.

How have you guys been doing this?     NBPL doesn't have any employees so 
it's got to have been done as Plains, yet I understaood that Plains could not 
provide services to others?

Subject: Re: O&M Fees at Interconnects

In other similar situations where Operations has had an opportunity to 
provide a service for a fee, we have been looking to EAMR as the entity to do 
the work.  Does the NBPL sitiuation preclude EAMR from taking on this role?  
I would assume, unless there has been a change, that given the fact that NBPL 
does not have any employees it would be difficult for NBPL to provide the 
service.

Subject: O&M Fees at Interconnects

The issue of O&M fees at new interconnects has been raised by several 
customers.  A meeting to discuss this issue and how Operations will determine 
these fees, is scheduled for Monday, December 18, on your calendar.  Your 
input is very important at this meeting.

Several of NBPL's customers are currently waiting for answers on this issue 
and NBPL needs to respond very soon to these customers.  NBPL has been asked 
to renegotiate fees (PGL&C) as well as set fees for a period of longer than 1 
year (Harvest States).  NBPL has also been asked to operate a 1/2 mile of 
line from a meter station to a power plant (Lakefield Junction).  We need to 
agree on a decision from both a business and an operations perspective.  
Currently, we have estimated operating fees at interconnects where we charge 
a fee and charge a standard monthly fee of $2,000 per month with the 
exception of two interconnects.  With the tariff changes, operating fees will 
not automatically be recovered in the future.  How are these operating fees 
going to be tracked and charged?  Does NBPL charge all interconnect customers 
the same fee?  Should NBPL absorb some or all of the operating costs as a 
cost of doing business?  These questions need to be answered at the meeting.

Thanks!

Over the last few months, we have been working on a new methodology to 
measure and report business unit's retrurns on invested capital.   Several 
different variations were considered, and I am glad to report that Skilling, 
Causey and Fastow have approved the process outlined here.

Simply stated (with an example shown below):  Return on equity will be 
calculated based on a pre-determined debt/equity structure.  Business unit 
capital will include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet uses of 
capital and business unit's will be charged for the cost of their debt at 
Enron's cost of funds.  Business unit's should focus on improving their 
return on equity over time.

______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________


______________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________


This metric will not replace other targets (i.e., IBIT and Funds Flow).  

We are currently working to overlay this approach to the submitted 2001 
Plans.  If you have questions, please contact myself or Mike Deville.

Rod,

After receiving feedback from both yourself and Phil Lowry through George 
Wasaff, we will cancel this meeting. Originally Peter Buettgen and I were  
anticipating the need to share the details of our process assessment strategy 
with you prior to our kickoff. However, it has been pointed out that Morris 
has been identified as the lead player and has responsibility for all 
decision making. Therefore we will be working directly with Morris and will 
not burden you with details unless Morris feels appropriate.

Thank you for your support and commitment in the completion of the iBuyit 
process assessment.
John

Rod,

Rebecca and I (along with John Garrison) actually were discussing the Wessex 
situation and your important contribution Wednesday.  We really appreciate 
the effort, and hope to keep you involved as and when this goes forward.

Earlier this week Sir Ian Byatt announced he would not approve the Kelda deal 
in its current structure.  His complaints were principally about 
mutualization, though he had some reservations about how they would address 
independence in the asset/operations separation--mostly related to keeping 
the responsibility on AssetCo for drinking water and environmental quality.  
Merrill Lynch thinks this will push the process back a few months, as Kelda 
redraws and the new regulator (a life-long bureaucrat) cautiously moves into 
his new role.  

I suspect we will try to reorganize the business more formally along these 
lines, but may be holding off on detailed work on the contracts for a 
while--assuming our board would prefer us to be the second company to go 
through this, not the test case.  We'll know more after the dust settles on 
the recent Ofwat announcement and our board meeting on August 7.

As for expenses, I leave that to Michael, but I imagine it would be easier if 
you processed the info and sent a single bill to AZX.  Thanks.

I'm not sure what you have heard back from the crew in Bristol/Bath, but I 
found them to be very interested in achieving maximum success.    There was a 
lot of learning on my part, but I'm now more convinced than ever that Wessex 
is very much like our gas pipeline business.    Even to the fact that the 
internal regulatory types don't believe the regulators will approve it.     I 
have offered continuing assistance as needed (in fact have a conference call 
setup for tomorrow).    I was able to give them the benefit of my experiences 
and tried to create analogies to our experiences here.   In some cases I'm 
sure it made a difference, in others the group may actually be in front of 
some of our thinking.    I think I can see an opportunity to expand the 
thinking on both sides of "the pond" in the regulated businesses  with just 
some simple contacts and have promised to help them at least start 
conversations with more counterparts in the pipeline group.    

Let me know how you want me to charge you the travel costs.     I can submit 
the claim here and bill you or I can submit the claim to you.

I want to thank you for your participation in our Asian MBA program on
Friday.  Your comments were very helpful and our students profited
enormously.

I am very excited about Enron's desire to develop further their relationship
with the College of Business.   As I mentioned, I think that the next step
would be that you and perhaps some others from your recruiting team meet
with myself, Bob Casey, and Althea Gordon, from the Office of Career
Services.   We have some tremendous initiatives going now in the College and
the Department that I am sure Enron would be interested in.

I don't think we can wait. We need FERC solutions in SAP (and perhaps the 
data warehouse) relatively quickly. 
We have an "enterprise" issue localized in ETS -if that helps getting any 
action.

Fundamentally, through my recent "investigation" I have become acquainted 
with numerous significant FERC module and FERC related issues -with little 
apparent solution to date. The items are being worked...

Composite depreciation is not correct  -millions of $
SAP natural accounts do not reconcile to the FERC module -the FERC trial 
balance does NOT balance
Labor distribution true-ups are not correct for FERC purposes -costs are 
being misallocated  (this was originally deemed a show stopper)
AFUDC is not calculating consistently with pre SAP methodologies
FERC ledgers are not available
FERC "Users" were ready to test out the FERC data warehouse but that 
opportunity was nixed by the decisions below
We are unable to obtain detailed benefit information for rate purposes
Benefits have been charged out incorrectly (nearly resolved)
Anxiety issue >We have little confidence we'll be able to efficiently prepare 
timely year end FERC Form2 reports* for Enron pipelines (submission deadlines 
for which are well before any Project Sunrise timetable.)

* there is voluminous revenue/volume, financial, property and tax related 
data required for this document, all of which has to be stated in FERC format.

Do you think it better that I wait and see what comes of this, or because I 
have a singular need that I cause a small group to come togehter and focus on 
this?     The fact that there is no solution is the issue and no solution 
merely means I have to find one, since I don't have the option of saying it's 
too hard or the system can't do it.    On the other hand I'm sure I don't 
know all the answers so I'm not sure of what the right process even is.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse

To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we 
need to find the best way to fix it.  I would just be sure not to jump to the 
DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

I was just kidding.  The EOTT template looked familiar to me.

As Caroline pointed out,  they used the ETS IT template and made a few name

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our

FYI
Attached is a a current worksheet of the ETS accounting organization. (Sorry, 
I haven't been able to prepare an org. chart yet). This still reflects Clean 
Fuels as dotted line; but we could easily "plug" Kerry and his organization 
into the structure in any one of a number of areas, but most likley would be 
with Jennifer Lev in consolidations. I would like to have nonregulated 
entities kept separate from interestate pipelines -as possible.

Dear Mr Hayslett

Keith Harris has passed me your note regarding a visit to Wessex Water.  I
need to ascertain a few things before I go ahead and make arrangements.
They are:

When will you be arriving (date and time)
How will you get to Bath?
Have you booked any accommodation?
How long will you be with us?
Have you booked any appointments to see Wessex Water and Azurix Services
staff?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Marilyn Smith

Rod,  

The PRC process closed last week.  You should have received information 
regarding representing your associates/analysts at a meeting to be held on 
the 28th of this month.  If not, you should check with the Associate/Analysts 
or HR for this information.

After the pre-ranking meeting, then you should submit the ranking and your 
evaluation to Mark for the final Corporate ranking.

Thanks.

NEW LATIN POP, DANCE AND MIX MUSIC ON NETRADIO.COM

Candy Cintron, NetRadio's Latin music programmer, has been working like
one of Santa's elves on a slate of new Latin music channels. The first,
"Tropical," debuted last month (it's temporarily known simply as "Latin"
on the site). The next two went live yesterday: One is "Romance Latino" -
a
pop and dance channel featuring familiar names like Christina Aguilera,
Selena and Gloria Estefan. The other is "Latino Mix" - a "Top 40"
format featuring an eclectic mix of chart toppers like Ricky Martin and
Alejandro Sanz. Links to all three Latin channels are below.
Watch for two more to arrive in early 2001!

New Channel! Romance Latino:

A NEW NETRADIO EXCLUSIVE: Q&A WITH MICHAEL MCDONALD

Driving down a Tennessee highway, solo artist and former Doobie Brothers
front man Michael McDonald dialed up NetRadio for a conversation with
staff writer Steve Marsh. In our exclusive Q&A, McDonald discussed playing
live, his move from L.A. to Nashville, his new album Blue Obsession, the
record label he co-founded with Jeff Bridges, and what it's like to return
to the stage with his fellow Doobies.
http://www.netradio.com/features/mcdonald.html


ANOTHER EXCLUSIVE: IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH RICHARD MARX

Beyond gigantic 80s hits like "Right Here Waiting" and "Hold On to the
Night," and the relatively quiet career he's had in the 90s, Richard Marx
continues to be in demand as a producer for artists ranging from Lionel
Ritchie to the latest boy bands. (And he's still so cute!) He also
continues his career as a humble adult-contemporary artist (his new album,
"Days in Avalon," was just released on his own label). NetRadio's John
Michaels sat down and talked to Marx about his time at the top of the
charts and his continuing work.
http://www.netradio.com/features/richardmarx.html


AND YET ANOTHER! IN THE NETRADIO STUDIO WITH CHIP DAVIS

Mannheim Steamroller founder and driving force Chip Davis is among the
pioneers of neo-classical electronic music, and with his independent label
American Gramaphone, he helped give rise to the New Age music phenomenon.
His path to his current post with his Grammy-winning group Mannheim
Steamroller included many sidetracks, from teaching music and writing
advertising jingles. Davis talked to NetRadio programmer Jane Fredericksen
about his impact on the New Age landscape and Manheim Steamroller's huge
holiday success. http://www.netradio.com/features/chipdavis.html

Subject: Year End Operations Administration Meeting

This meeting will be held on 12/13 starting at 8:30 AM in 3AC19C1.  In order 
to ensure the meeting moves quickly, please provide a pre-rating to me for 
each of your employees.  I need these ratings by 5:00 PM on 12/8/00 to ensure 
they are loaded for the meeting.  To help you pre-rate your employees, the 
Corporate distribution is as follows:  


5% Superior
30% Excellent
30% Strong
20% Satisfactory
15% Needs Improvement/Issues


Business units are expected to meet these targets or do their best to meet 
these targets.  However, no rankings will be forced.    Please keep this 
distribution handy when pre-rating employees.  If you need any help, please 
feel free to call me.  Thanks!

simultaneously demystify the 50th floor.

For your reference, the offices that will be decorated are listed below:
St. Lucia - Ken Lay
Kwaanza - Jeff Skilling
Los Posadas - Rob Walls
Chinese New Year - Cindy Olson
Hanukkah - Andy Fastow
Ramadan - Rick Buy
Devali - Rick Causey
Christmas - Jim Derrick

We would welcome Executive Committee members to volunteer to greet employees 
in the 50th floor elevator lobby or serve punch.   Time slots are available 
in 15-minute increments from 3:00pm to 5:00pm.  Please reply to this e-mail 
if you would like to volunteer for this event and I will provide additional 
information for your reference at that time.

This annual affair is an employee favorite and you may contact me with any 
comments or questions.

These are my thoughts based upon general knowledge of the year and some

lead me to believe that he would think I might be being too generous on

>From casual observations, I cannot dispute your ratings.   I do feel that 
Dave needs to step up to the plate and start delivering some new and creative 
solutions for outstanding issues.  He has the capabilities.   It seems he 
tends to manage too much by wandering around and not taking the lead.

I fully support Barney's rating, but could see both Dave and Larry's ratings 
being on the lower edge of the recommended ratings.

I will do all I can to shore up the organization by placing some expectations 
for improvements before the whole group and dividing up the accountabilities 
accordingly.

I fully support what you have recommended.

Rod,
Caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the Risk System so I wanted to 
go ahead and respond since Steve is out this week.

I don't think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed, 
but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs. using an 
Enron Risk System.  We did more research and got the other groups involved so 
that they would understand our decision.  I believe everyone is now 
comfortable with our purchase decision.

In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because 
we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche 
and Ernst & Young.  These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have 
audited this application and have actually participated in numerous 
implementations.  Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable 
Resources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 
6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for 
Tractabel.  After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we 
felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit 
concerns.  Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be 
established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of 
those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the 
product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new 
business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. 

Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all 
the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year 
maintenance.  This cost does represent a very limited implementation with 
only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no 
electronic interfaces or data conversion.  The assumption is that initially 
the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost 
justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as 
well.  The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year.  We 
did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original 
cost of the Revenue Management RAROC.  Let me know if you have any other 
questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to 
completing the contract.  We are hoping to get this signed and the project 
underway next week.  Thanks.

Gentlemen:

I'm excited about moving forward with this new organization.

I have attached a file with minor suggested modifications, and have started 
to drop in names.  (Run on legal size paper)

My only major concern to the organization of the Planning function.
Specifically, with respect to an operating, capital and cash flow plan, the 
org. chart appears to have the bulk of the new functional organization 
supported but a number key income, capital and cash components missing.  

I would like to discuss/clarify Planning with the two of you, and recommend 
that we then identify the next level of leadership
AND the # of "boxes" they have to work with; and then bring the bigger team 
into a room and "divey" up the remaining resources -sort of an NFL draft 
model.

Subject: Asset Divestiture Approval

Attached is a  "Asset Divestiture Approval Form" for the sale of the 
Faribault Minnesota branchline location # 83801 consisting of 1.091 miles of 
6" pipe and the Faribault TBS#1 and the Northfield branchlines location No.'s 
85001 and 85002 consisting of approximately 4.9 miles of 4" pipe, and the 
Northfield TBS#1.  



Please indicate your approval or rejection of this proposal on the approval 
form and return to either James Centilli (EB4250) or David Waymire (OMA0755) 
by 5PM Monday, November 27th.  If you have questions or concerns, please 
contact James Centilli (853-5028) or myself (398-7062).

These branchlines are experiencing heavy encroachment.  The Faribault 
branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in 
order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized 
gas because of the population density along the pipeline.  

There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines.  There is an 
estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense, 
exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure 
branchline odorization.

The net book value of these facilities is $57,712.  The facilities will be 
sold for $1.  In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year 
transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000.  

The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as 
to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and  will 
be treated as a non-operating unit.  This will allow the undepreciated 
balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves.

The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the 
main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000.

Dan -

Attached from Trailblazer is a Resolution for execution which approves 
various aspects of the proposed expansion.  The issues and the 
recommendations are those which I have reviewed  and agree with.  They are 
also the exact same as the information I sent previously to you for review.  
There is nothing new.  Are you OK with me executing these??????

Also, I am working on another financing option with Kinder-Morgan  which 
would basically increase Trailblazer's debt structure (partly in preparation 
of the next rate case in 2003) which would result in increased cash 
distribution to the partnersa in 2001.  This cas could then be used to fund 
our cash call  for the equity financing(30%) of the expansion.  There would 
be a timing difference - we would get increased cash distributions in 2001, 
and then have to make our cash call in 2002 for appr. the same amount.  I 
will develop this in more detail later this week.

Let me know of any concerns.

and from time to time we've entertained the idea of bidding out the service.

Subject: Re: Insurance Claims

Actually, I am not sure NPNG currently has a lot of expertise in this area.  
I have asked John to evaluate whether corporate should handle NBPL's 
insurance needs.  We have Jim Menning, spending about 75% of his time on 
insurance so I am hopeful that a move to corporate could reduce our costs - 
but obviously eliminating 0.75 FTEs is minor compared to the effect (plus or 
minus) of a change in direct insurance premiums or allocated insurance 
costs.  Do either of you have experience or information that would support 
either side, i.e. directly manage ETS insurance function or outsource it all 
to corporate?

Rod, per our discussion recently, I've drafted up some language to be 
included in ETS approval authority guidelines in the event that projects 
overrun their initially approved amounts:

Once capital projects are approved (whether included in the Plan or not), 
spending is limited to the approved level. If a project is projected to 
overrun, proper approval authority must be obtained prior to expending or 
committing to anything over the approved amount. In no case, can anything be 
spent over the approved amount without obtaining additional approval.

To determine the appropriate approval level needed, add the expected overrun 
to the originally approved amount. Then go to the appropriate section (ie 
projects not approved in the Plan or projects approved in the Plan) and 
identify the appropriate approval level for the new total. For example, if a 
capital project was approved in the Plan for $1.8MM and it is projected to 
overrun by $.2MM, the ETS President can approve the overrun. However, if the 
original amount were $1.9MM in the Plan and is expected to overrun by $.2MM, 
the ETS President cannot approve. It must go to the GPG CEO. Further, if the 
project's new total exceeds the GPG CEO authority, the decision will be made 
at that level when and how to obtain approval from Enron's Office of the 
Chairman.

131 - Clay Street
  10 - P O Box 4666

Subject: ETS Headcount

Rod, your request for headcount numbers was forwarded to me from Wilson.  As 
of 11/06/2000 the total headcount for ETS is 2647.
This total includes all active, regular full time hourly/salary employees.  
The total number of employees increases to 2663 if you add regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.

The total number of Houston based employees is 607.  This number includes all 
active, regular full time hourly/salary employees whose work city is 
"Houston".  This includes 1400 Smith, 333 Clay, 2900 N. Loop and 15229 
Kuykendahl.    This number increases to 613 if you add regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.  

If considering Pasadena as part of "Houston", totals increase to 660 for 
regular full time hourly/salary employees;  666 including regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.  

Clean Fuels and the newly transferred EOTT employees are included in all of 
the above totals.  If you need additional information or a more detailed 
breakout based on different criteria, you may call me at 3,4878.

Thanks.

Greetings!

Due to overwhelming demand, we've added new functionality to our "Improve
Your Boss" assessment results.  In addition to your original grades (by
category), you can now see how you did on a QUESTION-BY-QUESTION basis.

We are providing this enhanced reporting free of charge.  To see this new
information, just login at:
http://www.improvenow.com/assessments/IYBoss/BossResults/

Your login is: rhaysle@enron.com
Your password is: 84ot8g

We hope you find this more detailed information beneficial.  Please let us
know if you have other suggestions to make this tool more useful to you.

If you should care to repeat the assessment process, you should be aware
that we are now charging "top-down" users $9.95 for each employee you invite
to participate:
http://www.improvenow.com/assessments/iyboss/index.cfm?action=topdown

In keeping with our vision, however, new assessments initiated "bottom-up"
by individual employees are still free.

On a final note, we are also undertaking a limited number of custom
development projects.  If you're interested in a customized employee opinion
survey, retention survey, or 360-degree feedback tool, please visit our site
and complete this short online inquiry form:

Based on the attached, NBP is extremely cheap!  While the level of required 
premium over the current market price to buy back the shares is difficult to 
determine, I wonder why we wouldn't take a hard look at buying Duke's units 
(at no premium).  I see basically two paths:  First, a strategic investment 
made in contemplation of buying the remainder of the NBP units back 
(presumably at a premium over current prices)  and then contributing the NBP 
investment into the new regulated entity structure (at higher values).   
Second, at these prices the investment in NBP units compares favorably to 
other acquisitions GPG is looking at, e.g. East Tennessee.  Even if the 
contribution to the new entity doesn't occur, GPG could hold the Duke units 
for an indefinite time period, report reasonably good incremental earnings 
and cash flow and sell them back to the public at an opportunistic level.   
What do you think?

Rod,

Here is an updated comparison of "2X NBPL Ratebase" (as you defined it) to 
yesterday's closing price for Northern Border Partners.

I have also populated the matrix for various unit price premiums.

Call if you have any more questions.

Please see below how Jim manually voted.

Do you want a machine recount plus a manual recount of the votes so that you 
have a chance to compare the EOTT template to the ETS IT template?

seems to address all important considerations. i would vote (manually) for a

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our 
major projects (over $1.0 MM), could even go lower?   This has been proposed 
by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

Rod,

Legal is reviewing the contract at this time and hopes to finish next week.  
Yesterday I was notified that the guaranteed revenues from the transportation 
agreement may be raised by $5,000 to $10,000 due to revised sizing 
requirements of  the TBS as requested by NSP.  

We have had several meetings with operations to ensure that the facilities 
that are included in the sale are correct.  Also, the O&M savings are the 
estimates given by the field.  Based on average costs for similar facilities 
the expected O&M savings would be between $6K and $8k. The field has 
indicated however because of the encroachment that they receive a large 
number of line locate requests each year for these branchlines which drives 
up the O&M costs.  My expectations are that we would save closer to $10k in 
O&M costs rather than the $20k.

In addition, regulatory reminded me today that there is still a farm tap 
issue that has to be cleared up before the sale.  All farm taps receiving 
service from these branchlines must be disconnected and service provided by 
another utility prior to the sale.  The latest estimate that I received was 
that this would be completed by the end of the year.

I would like to see a first draft of the 2001 goals & objectives by December 
11, 2000.

I specifically would like to see goals dealing with the following:

1.) Resolution of the Navajo Right -of- way issue;
2.) Development of a specific business plan for NNG's South End;
3.) Timetable for TW's new expansion;
4.) Timetable for the completion of FGT's Phase IV, Phase V, and PhaseVI;
5.) Pipeline safety legislation;
6.) Divesting of Enron's clean fuels business;
7.) Business developments efforts;
8.) NNG's Equivalent Unit Risk account  (how do we get our money back now !); 
and,
9.) E-Commerce Strategy.


We will discuss further at up-coming staff meetings.

Rod, here is my input on the 2000 Goals and Objectives. My numbering will 
correspond to the list of goals and objectives which accompanied your e-mail. 
    1. Completed. Final certificate was gotten in Feb. 2000 and the west leg 
construction was completed and in service around 10/1.
    2. Partially completed. PD received on Phase 5 on 11/21 but the EIS is 
not expected til 1/01.
    3. No input.
    4. No input.
    5. Completed.
    6. As you know, CitrusNet was not completed. We have developed a good 
structure for the transaction being considered a sale and we have developed 
the necessary contract documents to accomplish the deal but at present we 
have no takers.
    7. No comments.
    8. I think this was intended to be the MOPS sale which I believe has been 
moved to next year.
    9. No comment.
    10. Efforts were made with a couple of potential buyers to work out a 
deal but nothing definitive was accomplished.
    11. A lot of work was done in connection with Project Cristobal but 
nothing was finalized with potential partners.
    12. No comment.

This is a follow-up on our efforts to identify potential write-offs in 2000 
to utilize the possible availability of non-recurring earnings at the 
Corporate level.  Attached are spreadsheets for the 2nd quarter noteholders 
reports balance sheets, including detailed breakdowns of balance sheet 
items.  We reviewed these schedules for possible additional write-off 
candidates.  This review confirmed that the big items had already been 
identified (reg assets and south-end impairment reserve).  However, reviewing 
the spreadsheets reminded us that we have DOT safety user fees due in 
December (~$1.1MM) and a $1.5MM annual payment to Mobil due by 1/1/2001.  
While both of these items would more appropriately be charged to expense in 
2001, we could probably accelerate them into 2000 without too much visibility.

Actually, I am not sure NPNG currently has a lot of expertise in this area.  
I have asked John to evaluate whether corporate should handle NBPL's 
insurance needs.  We have Jim Menning, spending about 75% of his time on 
insurance so I am hopeful that a move to corporate could reduce our costs - 
but obviously eliminating 0.75 FTEs is minor compared to the effect (plus or 
minus) of a change in direct insurance premiums or allocated insurance 
costs.  Do either of you have experience or information that would support 
either side, i.e. directly manage ETS insurance function or outsource it all 
to corporate?

Rod,

I had heard from a friend of my mine that you were looking to add some 
finance positions in your group.  I am currently exploring opportunities in 
finance, and would be very interested in talking with you.  I am attaching my 
resume for your review.  

I would like to schedule some time with you, and would appreciate if you 
could let me know when it would be most convenient for you to meet, or if I 
should contact your assistant to schedule a meeting.  If you need to contact 
me immediately, please call my cell phone at 713-851-9764.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.  Thanks.

Rahul

Attached is list of the outstanding insurance claims provided to us by Risk 
Management.  As I indicated to Rod yesterday, I have been informed that the 
premiums that were paid this year were $15,000,000 and given the claims 
submitted at $43,000,000, Corp is looking for a way to mitigate anticipated 
rising premium costs.   They are looking very hard at Hawkin's Audit Program 
to help them out.  As this list indicates, International assets should bear 
the brunt of future costs.  The Transwestern train derailment will be about 
$700,000 ($200k for repair and $500k for buisness interruption), both of 
which will ulitmately be reimbursed by the railroad.

I do still have my file from the two meetings in which I participated with 
you to discuss the Omaha office.  I'll have someone bring it to your office 
this morning and you can copy from it anything you need.

Attached are the electronic copies of our flip charts from those meetings.  
Let me know if I can help further.

To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we 
need to find the best way to fix it.  I would just be sure not to jump to the 
DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

James,

I enjoyed being with you during our most recent trip and meeting with SoCAl 
Gas in Los Angeles.  After getting to know you (at least briefly) I was 
wondering if you could give me a little help.  My son-in-law is a young CPA 
who now works for Reliant Energy in Shreveport.  We have been circulating his 
resume a little around Enron and have gotten little interest.  Do you know 
anyone in the finanace end of the business (accounting, etc.) in which you 
could pass his resume along.  I would really appreciate any help you could 
give me.  Thanks, John Shafer

Trojan horse (TRO-juhn hors) noun

   1. A subversive group or device placed within enemy ranks.

   2. The hollow wooden horse in which, according to legend, Greeks hid
      and gained entrance to Troy, later opening the gates to their army.

   3. A set of instructions hidden inside a legitimate program, causing
      a computer to perform illegitimate functions.

[From Troy, a ancient city of northwest Asia Minor near the Dardanelles.]

   "Some upholders of academic tradition argue that the universities
   have been too ready to allow a Trojan horse inside the walls of
   learning."

Website for train times from Bath Spa to Paddington is www.railtrack.com.  I 
will however collect a pocket timetable from the railway station for you 
tomorrow which will be useful for you.

Just a few points I have noticed from the programme which I have not dealt 
with:

the programme states that the chauffeur bring you straight to Grosvenor House 
to meet Colin Skellett (rather than taking you to the hotel to freshen up as 
I suggested).   I will arrange a light lunch for you and Colin.

I have received written confirmation that your room at The Royal Crescent is 
o130 per room per night - a bargain!

you asked about dress code which I have not addressed.   It is a bit of a 
mixed bag here at Bath - some suits/ties others smart/casual - I wouldn't 
worry about it.     I thought I had better let you know however that it is 
"Wrong Trousers Day" on Friday for charity.     It is a national event and 
everyone is encouraged to where something they wouldn't normally wear to work 
- especially on the bottom half.   Don't worry we won't expect you to turn up 
wearing this dress code but thought I had better warn you just in case you 
see some "strange sights" on Friday in the office.

I hope you have a pleasant flight.

Best Wishes
Linda

Thank you very much.     What is the train schedule?    I think the train 
would be an
enjoyable experience.   I would like to leave at a reasonable time after 8 
and before 12 I
would think.    If there is a website for the train schedule you might point

Once again thank you for your kind assistance.

There are two Hiltons in central Bath, both a short walk from the office, the 
Roman baths, the antique shops, etc.  I haven't stayed at either.  They're 
both fairly modern hotels, so I'm sure they'll have all the stuff one needs 
for business, but probably no charm if that's what you or your wife like.

The Royal Crescent is very special.  It's more luxurious, with a spa and 
stuff, and less of the standard business hotel.  It's about a mile from the 
city center, but literally part of the famous Royal Crescent built by John 
Nash, the great Regency Period architect who designed Regent Street in 
London, etc.  Of course, I'm sure it's a lot more expensive, but I believe 
Wessex has a special rate there.

As for London, the Athenaeum is nice--modern, but in the midst of all the 
good stuff in Mayfair.  It's around a 15-minute walk from Enron's new office 
(and probably 15 minutes by taxi, given the one-way streets and traffic!).  
Our meetings will be in the City (ie, downtown), which is inconvenient to 
everyone but  where all lawyers, bankers, etc. have their offices.  Mayfair 
has many of the good restaurants, plus a lot of the good shops along Bond 
Street.  For a Mayfair location, the Athenaeum can't be beat.

My wife, Dede (who's coming with me), and I will stay at the Sheraton 
Belgravia.  It's about 1/4 from where we used to live,  and very close to the 
shopping along Sloane Street, Walton Street, and Knightsbridge (Harrods, 
etc.).  It's also 10 m inutes from Enron's new offices.  Other  good choices 
in that area are the Hyatt Carlton Tower, the Hyde Park (just revamped as 
part of the Mandarin chain), and the Berkeley (the latter two being very 
expensive).

By the way, if you haven't been to the UK lately, don't both with travellers 
checks, etc.--your US ATM card will work everywhere, and there's an ATM 
machine about every 15 feet in London and Bath.

Enron Corporation 

Dear Mr. Hayslett: 

I am pleased to invite you to join my CERA colleagues and me at our 20th 
annual Executive Conference, "Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for 
the Energy Future" to be held February 12-16, 2001 in Houston, Texas.? This 
is the premier international gathering offering senior executives new ideas, 
insights and strategic thinking on the issues facing the global energy 
industry.

I believe you will find the conference and related social events timely and 
of considerable value.? Our focus will be on the critical implications of the 
current market turmoil for energy strategies, investment, regulatory 
backlash, competitive dynamics, and industry structure.? Presentations cover 
all key regions and energy sectors -- oil, natural gas and power -- and their 
interconnections.? The conference is the centerpiece of CERAWeek, a full week 
of senior level meetings designed to foster exchange and learning, as well as 
informal interaction and networking.? Last year's participants included some 
1600 executives from over 57 countries.

Complete details on CERAWeek 2001 can be found at? 
http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=670&c=46788? . To register, please go

Although I did not graduate from U of H, I would be happy to assist you with 
any recruiting efforts.

Rod,
 Per your request this morning, it turns out you can't swing a dead cougar 
around here in GPG HR without hitting a U of H grad!  
 Kristin Passmore, an HR Assistant whom you may not have met yet, as well as 
Estalee and Laura all are University of Houston graduates in good standing.  
(Well, Laura barely is in good standing, but I'll let her be the one to tell 
you all about that.)  In addition, Miranda Southard, a student learner in our 
department, will be a senior this Fall at U of H. 
 Each of these good people has expressed an interest in helping you with any 
recruiting efforts directed at U of H alumni.  
 
  d.s.

Subject: Insurance Claims

Attached is list of the outstanding insurance claims provided to us by Risk 
Management.  As I indicated to Rod yesterday, I have been informed that the 
premiums that were paid this year were $15,000,000 and given the claims 
submitted at $43,000,000, Corp is looking for a way to mitigate anticipated 
rising premium costs.   They are looking very hard at Hawkin's Audit Program 
to help them out.  As this list indicates, International assets should bear 
the brunt of future costs.  The Transwestern train derailment will be about 
$700,000 ($200k for repair and $500k for buisness interruption), both of 
which will ulitmately be reimbursed by the railroad.

FYI.    This close date is of large significance to GPG as we are going to be 
asking management to wait an extra week for monthly info that ties out to the 
financials.     This variance from what we thought was a "Common Design" is a 
huge deal, in fact the agreed upon close timing was a major consideration in 
getting agreement within GPG to go forward as it was an improvement that we 
could see had value.   I agreed to and "stacked hands" with all on the 
"Common Design", yet somehow there has been a failure to deliver the "Common 
Design".   I just want to make sure that the two of you are aware of my 
position on this issue.

Subject: Risk Document Information


I think Steve was planning to add my comments on impact of prolonging GPG 
close to the risk document, but  I did not see it in the document I edited 
yesterday.  To restate, it needs to be noted under org impact that GPG's 
close is going from 5 to 8+ days which is unacceptable.  We have the 
impression that there is not sufficient desire/potential across the BUs to do 
what is necessary to get it down to the committed 3 days that we all agreed 
to at the ASE.  We view this as a showstopper and will hold the  project and 
COE and our own team accountable for meeting that committment by the end of 
the year if not sooner.  It seems like we should already have a plan in place 
on how we are going to achieve that.  This was a design signoff exception too.

Also, info for risk document below.  My question below was taken from the 
risk doc and responded to for actions that have been taken..

If you can, please update for these two items before next distribution

Thanks

Hi Rod

It was great to hear from you last Friday.  Thanks for
keeping me in mind.

I have attached a Word document of my resume which I
briefly updated over the weekend.

It looks like I would be available to go to Houston
anywhere between Friday June 9th and Thursday June
22nd.

Let me know if this timeframe works for you.

Best regards

Mike

Attached is a draft of the Corporate Services Agreement to cover the property 
tax function EOTT is moving to Enron.  Could you please forward this to the 
appropriate Human Resources and Legal people?  I am not sure who would handle 
this.  Also, if Rodney Meek's start date is something other than December 1, 
the Exhibit B-1 will need to be redone.  Thanks.  Please call if you have 
questions.  Mary Ellen Coombe is out this week, but I can contact her if 
there are questions on the HR side.

but what we look at internally).  I know this is a sensitive issue.

The following change in policy to e-mail and voicemail has just come to our=

attention.  This change in policy limits our exposure.  This type of exposu=
re=20
was discussed at this years management conference in San Antonio, listing=
=20
examples with Microsoft.  The largest impact of this change is your "sent=

mail" retention being reduced to 30 days from the current 365 days.  You wi=

note that if you move your sent mail to a folder it will be retained for an=

entire year which should minimize this impact.  The rationale for the=20
continued longevity in folders is that if you physically move mail to a=20
folder you are making a conscious decision to keep that document.

If you have not dealt with folders please give me a call and I can assist y=
ou=20
on their creation and on moving the documents into them.  Unless I hear a=

concern, this new policy will be implemented on Friday, December 15th.  Our=

This would be a good process to communicate the information needed for non 
budgeted projects.  What discretionary level to move budgeted dollars did 
Stan give to the VP's.  Anything above that level should be submitted for 
review by this process?

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our 
major projects (over $1.0 MM), could even go lower?   This has been proposed 
by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

Since ETS has third party debt on it's books, the debt and cost of carry will 
be excluded from the calculation so as not to double count.  

Rick wants it to actualy be booked.  I lean towards just calculating it and 
not actually make entries (I know that entries will cause all sorts of 
additional issues).   Nothing has been formalized yet.

Subject: Capital Charge and Calculating Return on Invested Capital

Over the last few months, we have been working on a new methodology to 
measure and report business unit's retrurns on invested capital.   Several 
different variations were considered, and I am glad to report that Skilling, 
Causey and Fastow have approved the process outlined here.

Simply stated (with an example shown below):  Return on equity will be 
calculated based on a pre-determined debt/equity structure.  Business unit 
capital will include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet uses of 
capital and business unit's will be charged for the cost of their debt at 
Enron's cost of funds.  Business unit's should focus on improving their 
return on equity over time.

______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________


______________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________


This metric will not replace other targets (i.e., IBIT and Funds Flow).  

We are currently working to overlay this approach to the submitted 2001 
Plans.  If you have questions, please contact myself or Mike Deville.

how to or whether to
account for the factor that the cash moneys don't start flowing in until 2nd

Horton and Burke have asked to discern the viability of GPG purchasing EOTT 
encroachment rights.  I'll dial into Millar and he'll conference in Rod.  
This should take less than fifteen minutes, then we can prepare a 
recommendation.

Subject: Re: Asset Divestiture Approval  

Rod,  to my knowledge the Commission has not specifically defined what is de 
minimus.   The working definition of an Operating Unit or System is taken 
from an Office of the Chief Accountant Interpretative Letter issued  May 26, 
1961.  "The principal tests are amount of investment, character of the 
property acquired, and continuity of operation.  The following have been 
deemed to be operating units or systems: a large compressor station, a 
processing plant, an important measuring station, a gathering system or 
important segment thereof,  a transmission line or important segment.  If the 
transaction involves such a small amount of property as to be de minimus, it 
need not be considered as an operating unit."  If a customer is attached to 
the facilities to be sold it is considered prima facie evidence that the 
property is an operating unit or system.

In a July 8, 1992, the NNG Rate department in an interoffice memorandum 
regarding the Definition of an Operating Units or System noted "The 
Commission has not specifically defined de minimus, however, based on past 
rulings we can assume that the investment must be something less than $9 
million, or a pipeline less than 7.586 miles."

The 1.091 miles of 6" pipe and Faribault TBS #1 and the Northfield 4" 
branchlines of 4.9 miles and TBS have a net book value of $57,712. 

My main concern, if we use the de minimus rationale, are we not setting a 
precedent in which future sales or acquisitions will have to be viewed?  Some 
of those future de minimus sales could involve gains! 

Again, it is not clear how the Commission will make its determination.  The 
downside, if the Commission rejects our argument, NNG will have a $ 58K loss 
on the sale of these assets.

I think an argument can be made that the amount is de minimus which leads to 
a non-operating unit designation.

Gary:  Are you OK with the non-operating unit assumption based on deminimus 
NBV?
If you're OK with it and the lawyers are OK, then it must be OK for me.

Subject: Asset Divestiture Approval

Attached is a  "Asset Divestiture Approval Form" for the sale of the 
Faribault Minnesota branchline location # 83801 consisting of 1.091 miles of 
6" pipe and the Faribault TBS#1 and the Northfield branchlines location No.'s 
85001 and 85002 consisting of approximately 4.9 miles of 4" pipe, and the 
Northfield TBS#1.  



Please indicate your approval or rejection of this proposal on the approval 
form and return to either James Centilli (EB4250) or David Waymire (OMA0755) 
by 5PM Monday, November 27th.  If you have questions or concerns, please 
contact James Centilli (853-5028) or myself (398-7062).

These branchlines are experiencing heavy encroachment.  The Faribault 
branchline is currently being odorized by NSP per a previous arrangement in 
order to comply with a commitment NNG made to the DOT to transport odorized 
gas because of the population density along the pipeline.  

There is no threat of a by pass by selling these branchlines.  There is an 
estimated annual O&M savings of $10k to $20k plus the avoided expense, 
exposure and operational headaches of not having to monitor high pressure 
branchline odorization.

The net book value of these facilities is $57,712.  The facilities will be 
sold for $1.  In addition, NSP has agreed to enter into a 1 year 
transportation agreement guaranteeing incremental revenues of $350,000.  

The net book value of the facilities, is assumed to be of such small value as 
to be de minimus as allowed by previous rulings of the Commission and  will 
be treated as a non-operating unit.  This will allow the undepreciated 
balance to be cleared to depreciation reserves.

The sale will require that the Northfield TBS be relocated upstream of the 
main line take off at an estimated cost of $225,000.

Rod,

Here are the credit rating ratios you requested for evaluating a potential 
deal.

In the spreadsheet I have given you two sets of figures for the year 2000 -- 
one set represents what was shown to the Board of Directors in December, the 
second set is the current set of "rating agency targets" for the year.

Please call me if you have any questions -- or need assistance formulating an 
analysis.

Since ETS has third party debt on it's books, the debt and cost of carry will 
be excluded from the calculation so as not to double count.  

Rick wants it to actualy be booked.  I lean towards just calculating it and 
not actually make entries (I know that entries will cause all sorts of 
additional issues).   Nothing has been formalized yet.

Subject: Capital Charge and Calculating Return on Invested Capital

Over the last few months, we have been working on a new methodology to 
measure and report business unit's retrurns on invested capital.   Several 
different variations were considered, and I am glad to report that Skilling, 
Causey and Fastow have approved the process outlined here.

Simply stated (with an example shown below):  Return on equity will be 
calculated based on a pre-determined debt/equity structure.  Business unit 
capital will include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet uses of 
capital and business unit's will be charged for the cost of their debt at 
Enron's cost of funds.  Business unit's should focus on improving their 
return on equity over time.

______________________________________________________________________________
______________________________________


______________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________


This metric will not replace other targets (i.e., IBIT and Funds Flow).  

We are currently working to overlay this approach to the submitted 2001 
Plans.  If you have questions, please contact myself or Mike Deville.

The attachment overviews an agreement for ETS to provide Desktop Services, 
Application/Database monitoring, and Windows 2000 conversion for  The New 
Power Company.  If approved by The New Power Company, this agreement will 
generate approximately $300,000 in revenue with a 35% profit margin for ETS.  
This will also open the door for a number of higher dollar service offerings 
including Optical Imaging and Disaster Recovery.

Bob Martinez and Kelly Strader are our IT point people for this transaction.  
We should know by year end if our proposal is accepted.

Lisa,

I decide to jot down some of my ideas for our eCommerce strategy.  For the 
most part, these are "brainstorming fodder".  Here goes:

Mindset:  If it can be sold, it can done via the Internet.
Mindset:  If it is currently done on a form, a forms-based electronic version 
should be created.
Provide our customers, operators with transaction preparation software which 
can be run on a desktop or notebook computer and a PDA.  Ensure that a 
synching mechanism allows for movement of the transaction to and from the 
PDA.  Use models such as MS Money for the PocketPC.  Give away this software 
and the pre-programmed PDA.
Allow feeding of the above transactions into an asynchronous process on our 
side.  This will help deal with unreliable connectivity.  Customers should be 
able to inspect the progress what is in our system.
Provide "wireless snippets" of our current applications.  This means 
extracting key decision points so that internal people or our customer can 
make them from anywhere.  For example, the customer would be able to confirm 
a pre-arranged capacity release deal.  Another example: contract request 
approvals could be moved to cell phones or PDAs.  This would speed our 
business processes.
Provide "respondable" notifications.  Internal people or our customer would 
subscribe to the types they wish to receive.  For example, a customer could 
be notified of a higher bid on a biddable capacity release offer and have the 
opportunity to bid higher via her cell phone or PDA.  Another example:  
support personnel could be notified of an unresponsive server and have the 
ability to initiate a reboot from her cell phone or PDA.
Base most or all of our Web pages on XML or provide an XML download (in 
addition to the current comma-delimited choice).  We should lead the way in 
identifying the necessary "vocabularies" for GISB data sets and data not 
currently defined by GISB.  This would permit the customer to move the data 
into any of several XML-capable tools such as spreadsheets, word processors 
and so on.  The more sophisticated customer may use the Web page address to 
extract data into their own custom apps.
Implement the supernom across ETS pipelines.
Is there an opportunity for us to overbook as do the airlines?
Expose some of our systems functionality via remote method calls using Simple 
Object Access Protocol (SOAP).  SOAP is based on the Internet standards of 
HTTP and XML and is, therefore, platform/ technology agnostic.  For example, 
we may allow the customer to obtain certain non-proprietary data base 
information such as name and legal descriptions of point locations, legal 
entity names, tax authorities, lat/long and so on.  We could get more 
adventurous by exposing such things as capacity currently not nominated ahead 
of the nom deadline.
Provide the customer the ability to assemble a contract electronically with 
pre-approved terms and conditions, locations and alternate locations, etc.
Provide annual usage statements to assist the customer with their planning.
Provide graphical displays of certain tabular data.  For example, we might 
show the customer actual versus nominated, nominated vs. MDQ, monthly usage 
charts, etc.
Consider where we could or should apply fees to some of the above services.

I believe I have a few more of these that I haven't yet extracted.  I hope 
these can be useful in today's session.

Terry

Marian - I wanted to let you know that I have hired a new accountant that 
will be responsible for fixed assets for EECC -- Biff Brannon, x66073.  He 
will be the primary contact  (I will remain the secondary).  As such, I would 
like Biff to be the representative from EECC to the Fixed Assets Council that 
we discussed a few weeks ago.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Before I answer this email, thought I would confirm with you how we intend 
collecting and distributing the $180K  rebate for the pre-buy program.  The 
methanol plant contributed $300K toward the $1.500K goal.

Thanks,

Shirley,

Now that we have discussed it, I understand sufficiently to be confident that 
it's good all around for us to participate.  It will alter our procurement 
timing a little if we do delay our overhauls to next year (we would be buying 
the long lead, high dollar stuff this quarter even if we do delay), but it 
seems clear that it is in Enron's best interest to make those slight changes. 

I will let our controller and Finance Manager know what's up just to keep 
them informed.  They may be helpful to us in figuring out how to get the 
rebate to come into GPG through Enron Methanol Company or Enron Clean Fuels.  
I will admit to very limited knowlege of how those transactions take place.

I will also let Debbie Hinkle (our buyer, 281/882-4232) know to expect your 
call about prices we have been receiving from Cooper.

Thanks again, 

Steve

Steve,

Per my voice mail today.

We would like to offer your operation the opportunity to receive 12% rebate 
on parts purchased from Cooper.  We have prepaid $1.5MM for parts and will 
receive a 12% rebate.

Other parts of GPG have used about $600K of the pre-buy and we would like to 
role your shutdown requirements into the program.

Please call me as soon as possible and I will answer any questions you have.

Look forward to talking to you. 
Regards,
Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Rod,

Here are few questions that I would like to run by you:

I got your message at Noon today, you indicated that you had been able to 
contact the following:

David Clements
Barney Brasher
George Quittner
Larry Fenstad ----not yet notified
Elaine Conklin----not yet notified

I plan on starting on Monday November 6th attending Phil's Monday morning 
staff meetings.   I also plan on attending Phil's staff meeting on November 
13th - half day - afternoon.

Are there any key points that you want covered in a weekly report?   When do 
you want the report in hand?

I plan to start meeting with Phil and all his direct reports (one on one) to 
determine their needs from our organization, as soon as the announcement 
comes out.  I will work with our organization to develop objectives for 2001 
based off these interviews.

Do you have any concerns if I go ahead and get with Human Resources and get a 
posting for an Administrative Assistant for myself?  

John Keller had a three day meeting offsite scheduled for next week in the 
Woodlands, that George Quittner and I are scheduled to be a part of.   I plan 
on missing the second day due to the meeting with CES on Thursday.

Are there any other pressing issues that I need to be involved with next 
week?   I understand that the EOTT budgets are due to the Administrative 
Directors on November 7th and to Tracey on the 10th.   When will the budgets 
be presented to EOTT? 

I met with Jerry Martin several times this week.   We also meet with George 
Wasaff and Derryl Cleaveland in the GSS organization a couple of times.   We 
decided it would be best for all of Enron, as well as for ETS to have Four 
(4) of the recommended six (6) EE&CC Procurement personnel to go into the GSS 
organization rather than the ETS procurement department.    We have moved 
Jerry Thomas, Dwain Moody, Rick Perkins and Sue Perkins to the GSS 
organization.  George Wasaff and Jerry Martin have agreed that Jerry Thomas 
will continue to manage the procurement of materials for Florida's Phase IV 
and Phase V projects, while lending his knowledge of compression to all of 
Enron.   We will use our procurement personnel to execute the material 
requirements.

Therefore we are only bringing two (2) people into the ETS organization - 
Mary Lynne Dix and Josh Mayes.    Jim Davis and Jerry Thomas have expressed 
real concerns to Jerry, George and myself about these decisions.   If we 
continue to manage projects in the traditional EE&CC manner, their concerns 
are valid.   But we feel if we partner with the GSS organization and properly 
use third parties for the peaks, we can manage these projects efficiently.   
We will continue to monitor the Phase IV, Phase V and NBPL expansion project 
closely to assure no loss of productivity during this transition.

John Keller, yourself and I met with George Quittner this week.   George and 
I are reviewing our organization and working on how to manage the 
organization most effectively for ETS Operations.    We discussed 
possibilities this week and it is quite obvious that we have different 
opinions on where we should be going with this.
We will meet next week to finalize a proposal.   More to come.

Do you have a good feel for what my job title should reflect on my business 
cards?    Should I just hold off?

Thanks again for your vote of confidence and the job offer.   I look forward 
to serving this organization in this capacity.   I look forward to our new 
working relationship.   I feel like I have a great staff, very capable of 
addressing the challenges ahead and turning the opportunities into real 
advantages for ETS.

Morris

As background data for Project Tangerine,  I've prepared a schedule (tab Greg 
Gruber Info) (per Rod's request) that is part of the file TOTAL TRADING.XLS.  
This shows the value of the administration payments to El Paso and Enron for 
2000, the supply volumes provided by each, the relative value at 11/1/00 
discounted at 6.5% and a list of contacts in Birmingham.  Additionally, the 
file titled PANNAT~1.XLS gives the details of the financial swap on the 
Amoco/Pan Nat volumes.  If you want to adjust the discount factor, simply 
change the value in cell B50 of the tab labeled Greg Gruber Info.  
Please feel free to contact me with any questions 713.853.6186 or the email 
address above.  The info included on these files can be pretty confusing.




FYI When Excel asks if you want to update the links, please say NO.  It will 
freak out the files.

Please find attached the ETS eCommerce/eBusiness strategy document.  

As there are many definitions associated with eCommerce/eBusiness, pages one 
to four of the document provide us a common definition and understanding to 
be used within ETS.

Page five overviews the statistics of the eCommerce/eBusiness transactions we 
have completed in ETS this year.  Included in the figures are close to three 
million eConfirmations and five million hits to our eInformational postings.

 Pages six to thirteen overview future ETS eCommerce/eBusiness opportunities 
with page nine listing specific goals for 2001.

This document was created with the collaboration of many departments.  The 
rapid pace of technology and the use of that technology in business practices 
will force continued input into this evergreen document.

Please let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification 
on any items contained in the attachment.

Thank you.

Dakota tribal wisdom says that when you discover you are riding a dead
horse,  the best strategy is to dismount.  However, in managing any
business
we often try other strategies with dead horses, including the following:

 1.  Buying a stronger whip.

 2.  Changing riders.

 3.  Saying things like "This is the way we always have ridden this
horse."

 4.  Appointing a committee to study the horse.

 5.  Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.

 6.  Increasing the standards to ride dead horses.

 7.  Appointing a "tiger team" to revive the dead horse.

 8.  Creating a training session to increase our riding ability.

 9.  Comparing the state of dead horses in today's environment.

 10. Changing the requirements, declaring that "This horse is not dead."

 11. Hiring contractors to ride the dead horse.

 12. Harnessing several dead horses together for increased speed.

 13. Declaring that "No horse is too dead to beat."

 14. Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.

 15. Doing a Cost Analysis Study to see if contractors can ride it
cheaper.

 16. Purchasing a product to make dead horses run faster.

 17. Declaring the horse is "better, faster and cheaper" dead.

 18. Forming a quality circle to find uses for dead horses.

19. Revisiting the performance requirements for horses.

 20. Saying this horse was procured with cost as an independent
variable.

 21. Promoting the dead horse to a supervisory position.

 22. .Involving employees in resuscitating the horse.

 23. Re-engineering the horse into a dead camel.

 24. Appointing a Kaizen team to remove three redundant legs from the
  horse.

 25. Having the horse ISO certified as dead.

 26. Asking the Union to cooperate with Management in propping up the
  horse.

 27. Using the equity in the saddle to finance the purchase of a dead
cow.

28. Splitting the horse into two smaller pieces to increase agility and
   speed.

 29. Threatening to kill the horse again if it doesn't get up and try
  harder.

 30. Sending the herd owner off to Executive Rider Development.

 31. Mapping the death process to determine potential improvements.

 32. Leveraging the value of the horse to acquire a glue factory.

 33. Shipping the horse to China to reduce the cost of riders.

 34. Investing in an IT overhaul to support a Resuscitation Relational
   Database

 35. Launching an IPO for DeadHorse.com

 36. Offering a buy-out package to riders 55 and older to reduce the
 horse's burden.

services that I am sure Enron would find of value.

Rod,

 It was nice to talk to you this evening. It did sound like you
 had a cold. There is no way to protect from going from air
 conditioning to the outside heat/humidity then back into
 the air conditioning. Just try to get some rest and we'll think positive
 for some cooler weather for you.

 Attached pls. find the photos I spoke of. There were 30 of them and I
narrowed them to the family I could name. I'll write more later.
 It would be great if you all came out around the holidays!
 Love,

 Dave...........

Subject: Lease Option on Trailblazer

To recap our recent discussion, my understanding was that you were looking 
for an Enron or NBP entity to serve as the lessor in a lease financing 
transaction that would be offered as an option in the pending EAMR bid for 
the Trailblazer construction project.  Since such transaction would need to 
be priced based upon the credit rating of the entity or the sponsors 
(depending upon the structure) the expected returns will not justify the 
balance sheet impact on Northern Border Partners if this entity were to 
function as lessor.  Furthermore, I have assumed that this conclusion also 
holds true from Enron's perspective given their strategy of reserving balance 
sheet capacity for higher return projects.

Since the bid parameters do not specify a lease requirement, Trailblazer may 
already have funding in place.  If not, EAMR could insert language in the bid 
that they or their designee would arrange lease financing for the project 
upon selection of EAMR as the winning bidder.  At that point, we would work 
with commercial banks or major leasing companies to develop a cost-effective 
financing transaction.

I hope this addresses your questions regarding the feasibility of such a 
transaction, but please call me at x7843 in Omaha if you wish to discuss 
further.  Good luck with your bid!

These will not work for GPG as they are all above thresholds in agreements

Subject: Cash Controls & Approval Authorizations

Bob, Wes, John & Rod -

Rick has asked that we develop Minimum Cash Control Standards.  These have 
been completed and we'll be meeting with each of you within the next 2 weeks 
to discuss.  A critical part of these Standards are "Authorization 
Guidelines" for approving transactions and payment execution.  These 
guidelines already exist for transactions flowing through the approval 
mechanisms within  Purchasing, Commodity, RAC, etc. systems.  However, we 
don't have minimum guidelines for g&a and other expenses.  Here's a proposal:
        Budgeted   Unbudgeted
Director    $50,000 - $1,000,000  Lesser of amount budgeted None, except 
emergency
        or $250,000    
Vice President   $1,000,000 - $2,000,000  Lesser of amount budgeted None, 
except emergency
        or $500,000    
Managing Director  $2,000,000 - $5,000,000  Lesser of amount budgeted None, 
except emergency
        or $1,000,000    
Executive Vice President $5,000,000 & Above  Same as MD

CEO (i.e. Stan Horton)     All over $1,000,000  All    
Each business unit CAO to designate approval authorizations below $50,000
Each Individual has the ability to further delegate the authority that has 
been delegated to them, but must do so in writing and be approved by the 
responsible supervisor
.
Just wanted to run this proposal by each of you and get your thoughts.  
Please respond with your comments so we can incorporate these into the 
Standards.

Thanks.

Terrie

I would like to have the dollars subdivided into pools for each of my direct 
reports with about 10% of my pool reserved for my use.    Can you help me 
with this?    I also understand that we are doing a handoff from Ben to 
Shanna for my support point, therefore I am sending this to both of you.     

For Ben:    Where are we on the job description I sent

Looking for an analyst to do research; starting with the NewPower deal.  I 
have access to Sebastian, but he is an associate and I am trying to use him 
in more of a deal making role, per your earlier instruction.

Rod,

I mentioned that I have been working on eStrategy.  I thought I would share 
with you my contributions.  The Word doc is a template that is partially 
filled in with my ideas (in blue).  Slides 6-8 are my attempt to condense my 
ideas into a couple of diagrams and e-Strategy statement.  I have worked 
primarily with Mike Sullivan on this but several others have played a 
reviewer role so far.  Of course, this is very preliminary but I thought you 
may find it interesting as you have always enjoyed technology.

Terry

I have attached two additional files that I hope you will find useful in 
completing your effort.

 This document contains definitions for terms commonly used in this project.  
It is provided so all the data gathered reflects that same understanding of 
what was being asked for.  Please refer to page three for data gathering 
worksheet definitions.   NOTE: The specific definition for STRATEGIC - the 
last column of the worksheet - is still being developed.  This should not, 
however, interfere with or hold up your work effort.


This is an early draft of the Gas Control Activity/Task worksheet.  I have 
added columns that incorporate all the requested data items.

This meeting will be held on 12/13 starting at 8:30 AM in 3AC19C1.  In order 
to ensure the meeting moves quickly, please provide a pre-rating to me for 
each of your employees.  I need these ratings by 5:00 PM on 12/8/00 to ensure 
they are loaded for the meeting.  To help you pre-rate your employees, the 
Corporate distribution is as follows:  


5% Superior
30% Excellent
30% Strong
20% Satisfactory
15% Needs Improvement/Issues


Business units are expected to meet these targets or do their best to meet 
these targets.  However, no rankings will be forced.    Please keep this 
distribution handy when pre-rating employees.  If you need any help, please 
feel free to call me.  Thanks!

Rod, it was our understanding that you were going to provide Kent and I  
worksheets that would show us how a potential muni prepay deal would affect 
Northern's bottom line.  Thanks.

We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be 
billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take 
it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will 
take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be 
done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the 
year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or 
Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.   
Tracy has the point on this one.

Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments?

Rod--

I never heard back from you on this airplane accounting issue for year 2001.  
Any thoughts on timing as to who we can work with to finalize by year end?   
Can we work with Dave Waymire here in Omaha??

Also,  there was an article in  this past  Sunday's World Herald that   FASB 
has reversed its position on merger accounting and will not require firms to 
amortize Goodwill  over time and  write it off against current income of a 
merged company.  In addition, the new plan would eliminate the  "pooling of 
interest"  restrictions and allow merged companies to sell off unwanted 
assets prior to the two year waing period now required.  I'm not sure if this 
revision would be applicable to mergers which occurred before this FASB 
revision or not.  

Do you have any insights on this???

Thank You.

Subject: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001

Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!

Thank you very much.     What is the train schedule?    I think the train 
would be an
enjoyable experience.   I would like to leave at a reasonable time after 8 
and before 12 I
would think.    If there is a website for the train schedule you might point

We will have to do project economics by pipeline as well as in total.    A 
way to allocate costs however is to do so according to the benefits 
received.      That way no one can argue that they didn't get the same 
deal.    If the deal makes sense from a group standpoint, then it should make 
sense from an individual pipeline standpoint.

Project economics need to be looked at in 2 ways.     1) The project 
economics on a stand alone basis and then 2) the more accurate approach of 
what does the project do to the entity (the with and without approach).     
The accounting return in the second approach has become actually the more 
important measure of success.

It's a bit difficult to distinguish capital vs. o&m from your list below, 
since you've used the same item description in both categories ie., 
"Resources" . I would be more than happy to develop a specific list or matrix 
with you.
Additional  "discretionay" items to consider are overheads, perhaps AFUDC, 
and perhaps indirect allocations (ie corporate allocations). 

There is more than capital and o&m to consider when developing a 
comprehensive project economic analysis or accounting recap.

>From an economic standpoint its critically important to identify all of the 
cash flows and their timing, both "in" (savings) and "out", and not worry 
about accounting. From an accounting standpoint; and if an ORR is necessary 
its important to identify
the accounting flow of a project which will always vary from the cash flow. 
Components may include:

Initial Capital,
Ongoing Capital
Overheads and AFUDC, if applied
Net O&M, direct and indirect
'Book"Deperciation
Tax Depreciation
Advalorem 
Current taxes
Deferred taxes
"Capital" allocations

In addition to the DCF return, I believe Rod wants us to determine the 
Operating Rate of Return (ORR).  If a new project is to replace an old 
project, we also need the net book value of the old project.  I am forwarding 
my September e-mail on Project Evaluation to you all.

Pretty good.       I would suggest you run these by Jim Saunders (to check on 
what should be capitalized and what shouldn't) and by Denis Tu (to see if he 
has run across any other things you might have left out in his experience).

As to the question "How will we account for the additional O&M budget dollars 
which could start hitting the O&M budget in the same year the project is 
completed?" that's pretty easy, they aren't authorized to be spent.    If the 
dollars for the support of projects aren't budgeted or specifically 
authorized in the project funding document, then something must be cut to 
allow for the dollars to be spent, or we will have to request additional 
funding to carry out the program.    When we do that, unless we are beating 
budget somewhere else, it would appear that we would not meet our goal and 
therefore the bonus pool of dollars would be reduced directly as a result of 
the additional costs.    (Bonus pool = about 2.5% of net income.)    This is 
why it's so important to get the numbers right as soon as is practical.

Subject: Project Economics

Steve asked me to put together something for everyone to follow in regards to 
Projects ASAP.  If my understanding is correct, to do the economics on a 
project, all costs must be included, ie. capital dollars, O&M dollars, and 
ongoin O&M dollars for the estimated project life.
This is a sample breakdown of what I came up with:
Current year Budget
 Capital Dollars
  Hardware
  Software
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes pagers, cell phone, salaries 
and benefits, etc.
   -internal existing
   -internal additional
   -contractors existing
   -contractors additional
  Project related Expenses
  Special services (dedicated phone line while in development, etc.)
  Other

 O&M Dollars
  Training and related expenses
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes employee expenses (training, 
pagers, cell phone, salaries and benefits/taxes, etc.)
   -internal additional
   -contractors additional
  Special services
  Other

Future Years Budget
 O&M Ongoing Dollars - project life
  Hardware maintenance
  Software maintenance
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes employee expenses (training, 
pagers, cell phone, salaries and benefits/taxes,etc.)
   -internal additional
   -contractors additional
  Special services
  Other

Current and Future Years Budget
 Capital/O&M Offset Dollars - project life (savings)
  Hardware
  Software
  Hardware maintenance
  Software maintenance
  Resources (all areas IT and User) - includes employee expenses (training, 
pagers, cell phone, salaries and benefits/taxes, etc.)
   -internal existing
   -internal additional
   -contractors existing
   -contractors additional
  Special services
  Other

I know we did not budget O&M costs related to projects in the 2001 budget 
because it would be unknown at budget time and not known until the project is 
actually studied in detail to be recommended to be done.  How will we account 
for the additional O&M budget dollars which could start hitting the O&M 
budget in the same year the project is completed?  Once a project is 
completed it is easy to account for the additional O&M dollars in future 
budgets.  Please let me know ASAP if I am on the right track with this.  From 
what Steve stated in his staff meeting and our brief phone conversation this 
is what I came up with.   Thanks...cvb

Rod--

I am leaving for Panama on Monday, will return on the 12th, and then leave 
for vacation on the 13th.  I plan to be back in Houston for good on December 
29th, but will also come in on the 12th after my flight arrives from Panama.  
If I need to be reached, you can contact my parents in Dallas at 972-255-6308.

If I don't see you on the 12th, have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
Christine

Rod:

Thanks so much for taking time from your busy schedule to meet with us last
week. We are extremely excited about the possibility of exploring
partnerships between the Bauer College and Enron and feel that we can do so
to both of our benefits. As we mentioned, we currently have a number of
Centers of Excellence in Energy, Technology Management/eBusiness,
Entrepreneurship and Innovation, and Professional Selling that could
flourish with investments by key business partners such as Enron. We look
forward to discussing these opportunities with you at the appropriate time.

Jerry

With the implementation of SAP, the employee expense report form has been 
modified to reflect the new coding system.  The procedures for its use are 
unchanged, but there are some cosmetic differences.  One item to note: the 
form no longer requires entry of your Social Security Number; instead use 
your new personnel number assigned through Human Resources (see 
http://hrweb.enron.com).  For electronically submitted expense reports, enter 
the same number on the receipt envelope.

The form is now available at the SAP website.  To access the form:

 From the Enron home page, go to the SAP intranet site http://sap.enron.com
 Choose one of the following paths:
 Click on Quick Reference Tools on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form

  Click on Forms and Procedures Library on the left menu
  Click drop-down arrow for Accounts Payable Forms
  Click SAP Expense Report Form
 Wait for it to load
 Click Enable Macros (or Yes, allow macros)

After you enter the data, save as Excel Workbook (.xls file extension) with a 
new filename.  Do not save as Excel Template (.xlt extension).

You may print the spreadsheet for submission to Accounts Payable, or attach 
it to Notes for electronic submission.  Instructions are available at the 
website, on the same drop down box as the form.

If you have any questions, contact the Center of Expertise (COE) at 713 
345-7427.

Phil, Rod & Mike -- please find attached a set of slides which will look very 
familiar to you.  They are the same format as the GTB slides we recently 
discussed, but are for the Trailblazer bid.  I would like to talk to Stan 
about this next Monday when we meet to brief him on GTB.  But, since I am out 
of the office until Friday (2 PRCs and Omaha trip), time is tight.

Do you want to review them Friday in person, before Friday on the phone, put 
off discussing with Stan, or discuss with Stan without us meeting?  I'm very 
comfortable with this one, and would like to go ahead and put it on Stan's 
table.

Mike - by the way, I meant to ask you at staff this morning -- can you 
clarify the memo you and Colleen issued regarding the role of EAMR as only a 
consultant?  I thought we discussed using EAMR as the contracting entity in 
projects such as these.  In that case, EAMR would take more than consulting 
risks.

Thanks,
Jerry

Please let me know if you can make a meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 19, at 10 am to 
discuss the potential LNG project in the Bahamas, the associated pipeline to 
Florida and the possible Florida power plant.  There may also be some revenue 
generating assets on the Bahamas side.  I will let you know the room number 
once I secure one.  For those who are not located in Houston, please let me 
know if you are available by phone.

Thank you,

Hello Rod.  At a glance it appears that I am the only GPG HR representative 
for this meeting.  Did you want to include Kristin Passmore and Estalee Russi 
(both U of H grads) as well?  Thanks.

Well if her job actually requires access, we need to figure out a way to 
grant it with rules.     How many others are there potentially in this 
predicament?

No, the FERC module is not completely secured. Duane was referencing the 
drill down ability to A/R only. Frazier recommends we prepare a policy and 
state that HPL is not allowed access to the regulated information. We may 
want to consider an enhancement next year to secure the FERC module by 
company.

I will let you know when the policy is finalized and seek your approval for 
Jane's access at that time.

Access to the FERC viewer role will allow access to all FERC drill down data.

No specific roles were mentioned in the memo.

Frazier,

Do we have concerns? I believe the access requested is needed to satisfy 
Intrastate requirements. If we approve, access to pipeline companies will be 
available as well.

Jane DOES need the FERC role.  She will be running the assessments for the 
FAR orders during the close process.  Co. 930 is a regulated entity and Jane 
will be accounting for it.  She will need access to the FERC account 
information in order to create the Rail Road Commission Report at year end.  
Please let me know who we need to direct this to and I will discuss it with 
them further.

Rod,  

The PRC process closed last week.  You should have received information 
regarding representing your associates/analysts at a meeting to be held on 
the 28th of this month.  If not, you should check with the Associate/Analysts 
or HR for this information.

After the pre-ranking meeting, then you should submit the ranking and your 
evaluation to Mark for the final Corporate ranking.

Thanks.

By Ben Spiess
                      Daily News Reporter

                      (Published November 18, 2000)

                      Gov. Tony Knowles said Friday that he backs
building a natural gas pipeline that runs to Fairbanks then down the
                      Alaska Highway to Canada and the Lower 48.

                      "My way is the highway," Knowles quipped during
the 7 a.m. speech before the Resource Development Council, a
                      nonprofit group that advocates developing Alaska's
resources. "An Alaska Highway pipeline will be the beginning of a
                      new economy for our state for the next 50 years."

                      Knowles' backing of the politically popular route
met an enthusiastic response among state officials and industry
                      executives. The construction would cost an
estimated $6 billion to $10 billion and could be finished by 2007. The
                      highway route would bring gas to Fairbanks, which
uses coal and fuel oil for electricity and heating, and hundreds of
                      permanent jobs in-state.

                      But proponents of a rival route along the Arctic
coast to Canada question if the highway route would be too
                      expensive to ever be built. They say their cheaper
project would give the state more money.

                      Driving this year's revival of gas pipeline
proposals, after more than decade of dormancy, are soaring natural gas
                      prices in the Lower 48.

                      With prices high, optimism bubbled high in the
hall at the Hotel Captain Cook, where Knowles spoke.

                      " 'My way is the highway' -- that's great," said
Mano Frey, local AFL-CIO head, as he shook Knowles' hand after the
                      speech. "If there is anything we can do to help,
just let us know."

                      Knowles' position on the pipe was hardly
unexpected as the governor and his staff have made broad hints that the
                      administration would back the highway route.
Knowles earlier said the project must hire Alaskans, provide revenue to
                      the state government and bring natural gas to the
state's residents, particularly those in Fairbanks.

                      All of Alaska's key political leaders now back the
highway route.

                      Knowles sped past other options for the North
Slope's gas reserves, including plans for converting the gas to liquid
                      form for the oil pipeline or shipping it to Valdez
or Kenai where it could be chilled, liquefied and shipped overseas as
                      liquefied natural gas, or LNG.

                      Communities along the oil pipeline route are
pushing an LNG project. North Slope Borough Mayor George Ahmaogak
                      said a pipeline to Fairbanks may help their plans.
Most agree there is enough gas on the Slope for multiple gas
                      projects. A spur line from Fairbanks to Anchorage
or Valdez could feed an LNG export project.

                      The most obvious losers with Friday's speech were
the Northwest Territories and Arctic Resources Co. from Houston,
                      Texas, a company hoping to build a Beaufort
pipeline, connecting the Slope with the Mackenzie River Delta.

                      Knowles' criticism of the Beaufort route focused
on environmental issues of putting a pipe in the Arctic seabed and
                      the time it would take to clear regulatory hurdles
with the project, suggesting such complications would erase any
                      cost advantage of the shorter route.

                      Forrest Hoglund, chief executive of Arctic
Resources, said Knowles' position "certainly makes our position more
                      difficult." But Hoglund said the cost advantages
of the Beaufort route remain. Gas prices will likely fall, and "the
                      markets will decide what this project looks like."

                      Pietro de Bastiani, assistant to Northwest
Territories minister Jim Antoine, said his government still supports the

                      Beaufort route. He said a pipeline tapping
Mackenzie gas would be economic without Alaska's reserves.

                      However, neighboring Yukon Territory supports the
Alaska Highway route. Much of the huge construction cost would
                      be spent there.

                      "We need this project," said Scott Kent, a member
of the Yukon Legislative Assembly.

                      What Exxon Mobil, Phillips and BP Amoco will do is
less certain. They are the three big owners of the North Slope's 35
                      trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

                      This week all three made optimistic but vague
comments about their plans for Alaska's gas. The companies hope to
                      jointly study a gas development project, said
Exxon spokesman Bob Davis.

                      Phillips and BP expect a decision on a preferred
project by the second half of 2001.

I asked Ozlem to give me a status report on FERC efforts to date.
Her update may be helpful in determining whether to meet tomorrow.
It reiterates the value of having Sean O'Reilly attend.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse


FERC Background:
When Sensecorp was hired to install the ACTA Rapidmarts, Enron requested a 
FERC Rapidmart which had not yet been defined by ACTA.  In order to fulfill 
Enron's requirements, Sensecorp hired a FERC expert, Sean O'Reilly to assist 
us in defining and developing a FERC Rapidmart.  At the time that Sean 
structured the Rapidmart he stated that the FERC information did not appear 
to reconcile with FI appropriately and that some changes in SAP were probably 
required to ensure that the information was correct.  Also before Sean left, 
he demonstrated to some Enron business representatives the functionality that 
would be available in the FERC Rapidmart but that the information would still 
need to be investigated and appropriately reviewed.

Project Sunrise:
At the time that Project Sunrise was initiated and there appeared to be some 
downtime for the Sensecorp developers, I approached Beverly Fennessy to 
contact FERC business representatives to review the FERC information and 
determine if it could be used with a few minor changes.  ( I was hoping that 
we might be able to quickly complete something that might be of use to the 
business)  We then set up a meeting with the FERC representatives to review 
the data.  

FERC Review:
However, as myself and Scott Brudner reviewed the information, we discovered 
that we are not FERC experts, and all the value that we would be able to 
provide in a meeting is to demonstrate the tables that were selected and the 
structure of the data.   We would not be able to explain FERC, how the module 
worked, or what the information meant.   It seemed that there would not be 
any true benefit in realizing a meeting to review that information - 
especially since we were aware that problems existed in the SAP FERC module 
which we would not be able to explain.  We felt that the only way to have a 
truly productive meeting and progress in the development of FERC was to have 
Sean O'Reilly return and assist us.  However, since Project Sunrise is still 
in the business requirements gathering phase, Beverly thought it was best 
(and I agreed) not to charge further development expenses to the project 
until we were in that phase of the project.  We thought it was best to 
investigate and further develop FERC once the project scope had been defined 
and FERC was included as a priority.   At that point in time we decided to 
cancel the meeting and informed the appropriate parties. 

Business Interest:
As you can tell from the emails below, there is renewed interest in reviewing 
the FERC information and furthering development.  However, Scott and myself 
will not be able to demonstrate FERC functionality to the business anymore 
than was already demonstrated to them by Sean in August.  In order to provide 
true value, we require the assistance of Sean and/or a tremendous amount of 
time to become FERC experts ourselves.  Neither of these items are feasible 
by tomorrow morning.  Please advise how we should proceed.  


Thank you,

Tzlem

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

one hour and your input would be greatly appreciated. I will inform you of 
the location when this is established. Please feel free to contact me if you

NALD, American Indian Report, Indian Country Today.


Okay, Michael, let me translate. 

 ??????NALD is the Native American Law Digest. ?It is published monthly, and 
Greg has been the editor-in-chief for the last 10 years. ?It provides a ?
synopsis of the most recent legal cases of interest to Native Americans ?
(both in tribal and non-tribal courts) and also runs articles. ?Articels do 
not necessarily have to be on strictly legal topics. 

??????The American Indian Report is also a monthly and also published by 
Falmouth. ?It covers much broader issues of interest to Indian tribes ??as
compared to the NALD.

 ??????Greg has a great relationship with Falmouth. ?I also know someone over 
there who owes me a big favor. ?Plus they are looking for Indian stories--and 
upbeat stories since many of the stories from Indian Country are downers. 

 ??????Indian Country Today is a newspaper and I believe that it is published 
weekly. ?Greg has good contacts, and the writers are ALWAYS looking for 
interesting stories. 

??????Also, I know a freelancer for the Gallup, NM daily paper. ?Some 
consider Gallup tp be the heart of Indian Country--and five or six tribes, 
including the Navajo are covered by the paper and read it as well. 

??????I, of course, would put the New York Times on the list. ?As I said, I 
think they have two reporters trolling Indian Country (particularly in the 
SW) looking for stories of ?interest. ?Although not widely read by Native 
Americans, it is read by educated Native Americans who are involved in state 
and national politics as well as by Native American attorneys and other 
professionals. Also, 30,000 to 40,000 Native Americans live in the New York 
metropolitan area. 

Also, major cities with significant Native American populations which have 
daily newspapers: 

Phoenix 

Albuquerque 

Denver 

Seattle 

Washington, DC ? 

??????Also, there is another magazine (bimonthly): Native Peoples: Arts and 
Lifeways. ?It casts a wide net and has included info on art, food, politics, 
grants tribes have received, etc. ?This magazine is read both by Indian 
wannabes and Indians. ?I also think it is read by Indians in the 
diaspora--that is Indians far away from their tribes or from Indian culture 
in general. 

??????Also, I believe that the new Native American museum scheduled sometime 
in the next decade (?) will have its own publication and will probably cast a 
wide net as do Native Peoples and Indian Report. ?(the museum I think was 
supoosed to open in 2000 and then 2001 and so I have no idea......) 

??????I have also just sent an email to a friend of mine who is the director 
of the Tribal Libraries Program at the New Mexico State Library to see if I 
have missed any publications of significance. ?The State Library has a 
newsletter which goes out to all the ?tribal libraries in New Mexico, and 
that number is 21. ?I think the newsletter is published every 2 weeks, and I 
am sure we could have this project covered in it. 

??????Also, the following paragraph is an email I sent to Greg Smith this 
evening. 

??????Is there any centralized way to find out about tribal papers? (I am 
laughing even ?as I write this....) For example, I know Navajo, Laguna, and 
Hopi have ?newspapers. ?Do we know of others? ?Also, do you know the name of 
the journal published at Cornell? Isn't that about Indian education? 

Regards--- 

Mary

Rod,
 Per your request this morning, it turns out you can't swing a dead cougar 
around here in GPG HR without hitting a U of H grad!  
 Kristin Passmore, an HR Assistant whom you may not have met yet, as well as 
Estalee and Laura all are University of Houston graduates in good standing.  
(Well, Laura barely is in good standing, but I'll let her be the one to tell 
you all about that.)  In addition, Miranda Southard, a student learner in our 
department, will be a senior this Fall at U of H. 
 Each of these good people has expressed an interest in helping you with any 
recruiting efforts directed at U of H alumni.  
 
  d.s.

Here is a start at the 2001 goals.      It will take more specifics before it 
is done, dates and measureable objectives but it is a start.     Please feel 
free to suggest changes, additions, deletions.     In the end we will turn 
this idea list into a scorecard.    I have not meant to exclude anyone, but I 
didn't get a lot of input from everyone on the beginning of the list.    
Thanks to Jim there is a longer list, than I might have started with.

Before I answer this email, thought I would confirm with you how we intend 
collecting and distributing the $180K  rebate for the pre-buy program.  The 
methanol plant contributed $300K toward the $1.500K goal.

Subject: Re: Cooper Alliance Pre-buy program  

Shirley,

Now that we have discussed it, I understand sufficiently to be confident that 
it's good all around for us to participate.  It will alter our procurement 
timing a little if we do delay our overhauls to next year (we would be buying 
the long lead, high dollar stuff this quarter even if we do delay), but it 
seems clear that it is in Enron's best interest to make those slight changes. 

I will let our controller and Finance Manager know what's up just to keep 
them informed.  They may be helpful to us in figuring out how to get the 
rebate to come into GPG through Enron Methanol Company or Enron Clean Fuels.  
I will admit to very limited knowlege of how those transactions take place.

I will also let Debbie Hinkle (our buyer, 281/882-4232) know to expect your 
call about prices we have been receiving from Cooper.

Thanks again, 

Steve

Steve,

Per my voice mail today.

We would like to offer your operation the opportunity to receive 12% rebate 
on parts purchased from Cooper.  We have prepaid $1.5MM for parts and will 
receive a 12% rebate.

Other parts of GPG have used about $600K of the pre-buy and we would like to 
role your shutdown requirements into the program.

Please call me as soon as possible and I will answer any questions you have.

Look forward to talking to you. 
Regards,
Shirley Jo Dickens-Wilson

Jeff is in 3AC1458.  I told him we would come over there.  But who else would 
you like to invite from GPG?  The same group that was at the reporting 
meeting yesterday?  If so, we can have Jeff come over here.  Would you like 
to try to include Wanda Labaume at this meeting?  We have not heard from 
either Jeff or Wanda.

and was 18
 inches long.  Mom and Dad are still in a state
of shock, and have already forgotten what a good night of
sleep is.  Claire is acting like a two year old and has claimed
Brian as MINE! MINE! MINE!

Subject: Re: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001  

We are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be 
billed to the RC reserving it for the flight.    If commercial wants to take 
it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.     It will 
take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be 
done.     The budget will be taken care of in Planning as we go through the 
year.      From an ETS point of view all of the plane is in Commercial or 
Executive (Stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.   
Tracy has the point on this one.

Jim Saunders:    What do you know about the other comments?

Subject: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001

Rod--

I never heard back from you on this airplane accounting issue for year 2001.  
Any thoughts on timing as to who we can work with to finalize by year end?   
Can we work with Dave Waymire here in Omaha??

Also,  there was an article in  this past  Sunday's World Herald that   FASB 
has reversed its position on merger accounting and will not require firms to 
amortize Goodwill  over time and  write it off against current income of a 
merged company.  In addition, the new plan would eliminate the  "pooling of 
interest"  restrictions and allow merged companies to sell off unwanted 
assets prior to the two year waing period now required.  I'm not sure if this 
revision would be applicable to mergers which occurred before this FASB 
revision or not.  

Do you have any insights on this???

Thank You.

Subject: Accounting for plane usage in year 2001

Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!

PLEASE KEEP CONFIDENTIAL

FYRvw - Based on my notes, attached is an initial recap of individuals to be 
included in "Accounting", and their current function. I have preliminarily 
left gas accounting in accounting, and as discussed, left Clean Fuels out -as 
a dotted line. 

Please edit/comment as necessary. 

I hope to work with Rod, Jerry and the Accounting Director team (Wiederholt, 
Chandler, and Cobb) to finalize the organization. 

Tracy and John K were going to work the Planning-side some more; and I will 
also discuss the other issues mentioned, with Rod at the Management 
conference.

Stay tuned...

Rod,

Here are the credit rating ratios you requested for evaluating a potential 
deal.

In the spreadsheet I have given you two sets of figures for the year 2000 -- 
one set represents what was shown to the Board of Directors in December, the 
second set is the current set of "rating agency targets" for the year.

Please call me if you have any questions -- or need assistance formulating an 
analysis.

Attached is a originally prepared by Kent describing two potential deal 
structures to move 2002 income to 2001 and/or to take advantage of a 
forecasted near-term drop in the forecasted strip price for 2002.  Kent is 
anxious to get feedback on these structures as he would like to lock-in 
prices yet this week if prices remain favorable...so timeliness is essential.

Dan Fancler and I have both reviewed Kent's write-up and our "accounting 
considerations" have been included in the attached memo.

If you would like to discuss this with us, Kent has asked to be included in 
the discussion.  Your comments will be appreciated:

Dear Rod:

You must be up to your ears in administrative paperwork.

I just wanted to touch base about our discussions.  You said that it would
be to your advantage to start some sort of analysis review this year
(budgets??), if this is still important we can still get started.  We can
start with one or more people with 48 hours notice.  We have a team on
stand by for you.  Let me know if I can do anything to help in this area.

Best regards,

J. Mark Kearns

The Market Service Team has reviewed their requirements for the proposed 
relocation of ETS within the Enron building.  Under this plan, Gas Control 
would not move from their current location and the Market Service Teams would 
be in close proximity to Transactional Marketing and Facility Planning.  
Julia's intent is to have discussion with Danny to make sure the 
organizations are aligned to support the commercial teams. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.

I say keep pushing for an answer.  It will come when it comes, but, in my 
opinion, he who pushes his issues the best tends to get closer to what he 
wants.  

I am hoping we can both do better in both the short term with the tools we 
have (working through Sheila Howard/ISC) AND come up with something even 
better in the longer run (Project Sunrise).  I would push Sheila, the ISC 
will do what it can to the best of our ability (and I am hopeful there are 
still some things we can do without the DW to get you closer), and she and I 
can push Mark to the extent the ISC can't solve it completely.

Do you think it better that I wait and see what comes of this, or because I 
have a singular need that I cause a small group to come togehter and focus on 
this?     The fact that there is no solution is the issue and no solution 
merely means I have to find one, since I don't have the option of saying it's 
too hard or the system can't do it.    On the other hand I'm sure I don't 
know all the answers so I'm not sure of what the right process even is.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse

To all:

Hope this clarifies--

We are currently collating needs data from our interview cycle.
Preliminarily, the interviews confirm our suspicions:
 1. Cost & P/L reporting is the most widely held concern.
 2. Cash flow reporting (treasury, direct & indirect) follows closely.
 3.  There is no easy, readily available solution to FERC reporting.
 4. People have lost ad hoc query functionality with the implementation of 
SAP.

Project Sunrise's reporting charter will be to address these needs in the 
most efficient, cost effective way possible.
That could be through a data warehouse, could be through the FERC SAP module, 
could be through another avenue.
None of us has the answer to the methodology question yet (although we all 
have ideas).

I would prefer to keep the Project Sunrise team focused on the task at hand 
-- sifting through the interview information and developing a work plan.
We have followup interviews to schedule & complete, a data model to build, 
etc. Basically a lot of work on our plates.

However, FERC reporting is clearly a significant need that will be at the 
forefront of any reporting solution.
If our goal is to discuss this need in detail tomorrow, I'm all for it! I 
need the education.
If our goal is to look at progress towards a solution, we should look to 
postpone.
I take responsibility for distracting efforts in progress, but believe the 
delay worthwhile.

One final issue: Sean, the Sensecorp consultant who has been working on the 
project, is in California.
We may want to wait on his participation.

I believe we are all on the same page.

Why wouldn't we?  ETS has a specific gap that needs to be addressed, and we 
need to find the best way to fix it.  I would just be sure not to jump to the 
DW as the solution, unless the ISC has been given ample opportunity to 
propose a solution.  Be sure to go that route, too!

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I feel we should proceed with the Dec 5 meeting, at least to get a better 
understanding of what the data warehouse can do for us related to FERC, and 
maybe determine just how far along it currently is.  The original reason we 
were asked to meet on this issue is that it was thought that a lot of work 
had already been completed and it wouldn't take much to deliver an end 
product. The other attendees, as well as myself, need to understand what this 
can do for us as opposed to a potential solution in SAP.

Subject: Re: FERC Data Warehouse  

I am not sure the statement below from Ozlem is entirely accurate.  In 
addtion to Project Sunrise, I have asked Sheila Howard, who is the lead for 
the financial team in the ISC, to work with the Project Sunrise team to 
understand what your issues are and help determine a solution.  

Let me assure you that whether through the Project Sunrise or the ISC, we are 
working on your issue and it has NOT dropped off the radar screen.  As a 
matter of fact, Project Sunrise had a status meeting today, and this came up 
several times.  I think the only question is "what's the best approach for 
solving it"? 

I will leave it to Dave, as the ETS representative to Project Sunrise, along 
with Sheila, Mark, and the others listed below, to continue to work on a 
solution for the FERC problems.  Dave  - is there any reason NOT to proceed 
with the December 5 meeting under these assumptions?  I would just ask that 
Sheila be included.

Thanks!

Dear FERC-interested representatives,

Due to the current redirection of the data warehouse project (which is now 
part of Project Sunrise), it has been determined that it is best to postpone 
a FERC discussion/analysis until after the  collection of business 
requirements and final scoping of the project.    However, I will be 
recommending that a focus group be designated for FERC.  Thank you for your 
help and patience and I apologize for the upheaval and postponements.

The review by ETS of the FERC data warehouse information will be on Tuesday 
December 5th at 10:00am, location TBA. This initial review should last approx 
one hour and your input would be greatly appreciated. I will inform you of 
the location when this is established. Please feel free to contact me if you

Rod, your request for headcount numbers was forwarded to me from Wilson.  As 
of 11/06/2000 the total headcount for ETS is 2647.
This total includes all active, regular full time hourly/salary employees.  
The total number of employees increases to 2663 if you add regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.

The total number of Houston based employees is 607.  This number includes all 
active, regular full time hourly/salary employees whose work city is 
"Houston".  This includes 1400 Smith, 333 Clay, 2900 N. Loop and 15229 
Kuykendahl.    This number increases to 613 if you add regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.  

If considering Pasadena as part of "Houston", totals increase to 660 for 
regular full time hourly/salary employees;  666 including regular parttime 
hourly/salary and regular reduced hourly/salary employees.  

Clean Fuels and the newly transferred EOTT employees are included in all of 
the above totals.  If you need additional information or a more detailed 
breakout based on different criteria, you may call me at 3,4878.

Thanks.

>From casual observations, I cannot dispute your ratings.   I do feel that 
Dave needs to step up to the plate and start delivering some new and creative 
solutions for outstanding issues.  He has the capabilities.   It seems he 
tends to manage too much by wandering around and not taking the lead.

I fully support Barney's rating, but could see both Dave and Larry's ratings 
being on the lower edge of the recommended ratings.

I will do all I can to shore up the organization by placing some expectations 
for improvements before the whole group and dividing up the accountabilities 
accordingly.

I fully support what you have recommended.

Rod,

Julia mentioned during our staff meeting yesterday that you had asked about 
University of Houston alumni within GPG.  I attended night school at U of H 
and received my MBA degree many years ago.  I'm not certain why you were 
asking, but if you need volunteers, I would be willing to help out with 
hosting, recruitment or interviewing of potential new employees.

Jeffrey McClellan is the president of cougars@enron and has a comprehensive 
mailing list of all University of Houston graduates within Enron.  You may 
want to contact him for this listing.  As you can see below, he coordinates 
the alumni recruitment within Enron.  If you need any help, please give me a 
call at ext. 3-5691.

Rod,
FYI - Here is Ted Robinson's (ENA) assessment of MTBE's situation for 2001.  
Sounds a lot like 2000.  Our 2001 Plan is based on an average margin of $0.23 
for MTBE.

Subject: 2001 MTBE

Per our discussion, I have talked with Adam on butanes for Q2/Q3 of 2001 and 
put a guess at next years MTBE.  Adam feels the strip for butane would run 
around 58 cpg or so.  Nat gas is on fire right now and looking at the screen 
is around 5.25 for that timeframe, which would put methanol around 60cpg.  
Elliott says that even with the run up on gas, methanol has yet to respond.  
Maybe it moves up if MTBE turns around and we see some demand come in, but 
for now it has stalled.

During Q2/Q3 2000, MTBE was extremely volatile, ranging from 8cpg  to 65cpg 
over merc gasoline ( with an average of 33cpg).  Several factors contributed 
to this swing, including strong demand in Europe and the US due to  tighter 
gasoline specs in both regions.  These specs remain and to that extend, many 
of the factors that contributed to last summer's run up will be in place in 
2001.   As we close in on 2003, US demand should decrease as refiners, 
especially on the West Coast, gear toward a phaseout of the product.  MTBE 
usage will remain in place in 2001 however as all contract users (refiners) 
are out for bids on product for the full year and Europe goes through a 
second round of tightening gasoline specifications. 

 Gasoline is currently around 77cpg for the Q2/Q3 strip.  I don't think that 
20-25 cpg as an average over gasoline is an unreasonable assumption on which 
to  base future Q2/Q3  economics.  With butane at 58cpg  and methanol at 
60cpg, this would yield an MTBE price of 97cpg and a margin over feed cost of 
19-24cpg.  Q1 and Q4 will more than likely be somewhat lower, but provide 
ample margins in Feb/Mar as well as Sep/Oct .

Hopefully this helps.  If you have any further questions, give me a call.

Ted

fact true)?  Could that rationale apply to our investment in NBP?
Are we required to carry LP interests on an equity method?  Why, given that 
no real control follows the LP unit?
Could the GP interest be bifurcated from the LP, i.e. carry the GP on the 
equity method and the LP on a cost or mark to market method?
Is there any basis for carrying newly purchased units on a different method 
than our original holdings?

Have I missed any?

Since Elaine and I are planning to be at the AA Symposium tomorrow, we are 
providing you our laundry list of year end IBIT items for discussion at your 
meeting tomorrow.  

FYI, if we have more items than you need in total, the items I would prefer 
to pull back first would be the Mobil payment, the DOT safety user fees, and 
the capitalization of specialized overheads.








Please let us know how you wish to proceed.

Rod,

I spoke with Colin Skellett (CEO of Wessex and AZX's vice chairman) and Keith 
Harris (Wessex's CFO) late this morning.  Here are some thoughts coming out 
of this conversation:

Wessex is launching the "heads of terms" (Britspeak for detailed bullet-point 
term sheet) with their lawyers, who have the Kelda announcements and 
experience on having done this in the electric industry in the UK.
Colin and Keith's view is that you will be extremely helpful in looking at 
how this works in practice and being sure the commercial overview points (not 
necessarily water industry points) are being addressed, from the perspective 
of both the service and the asset companies though obviously principally from 
the service company viewpoint.
The broad schedule is to meet with the lawyers Monday July 10 in London to go 
over the format, after you've had some time to acquaint yourself with what 
you need to understand about Wessex or the UK water industry.  (Keith is 
confirming that date with the lawyers but believes it will work.)
After that meeting, the term sheet will be refined on an iterative basis, 
probably going to full contract draft without numbers in, so that all issues 
are on the table in advance of the AZX board meeting, which is set for Monday 
Aug 7.  (Note that we will probably do the asset/service separation 
regardless of whether we decide to monetize the asset piece in some form.)

We've set up a conference call, subject to your schedule, for 10:30am Houston 
time tomorrow (Wednesday June 28) to go over this game plan.  From there, 
given the US holiday and other items, it's sounding like this will work well 
with the timetable you and I discussed yesterday.  In particular:

You could fly over to the UK Wednesday night July 5, arriving Thursday, and 
spend perhaps Thursday pm and all day Friday with Wessex personnel learning 
more about their business.  (They have a fairly standard tour of customer 
center, laboratories, and water and wastewater treatment plants that could be 
organized and I think would give you a good overview of their facilities.)
On Monday we could meet in London.
You could fly back to the US Tuesday the 11th, making your meeting on 
Wednesday the 12th as planned.
You would have ongoing involvement, perhaps involving a further trip to the 
UK, before the AZX board meeting in August, and thereafter. 

Unfortunately, that leaves you with a weekend in the UK.  You'd have to 
endure a tour of the Roman baths (very fascinating), a weekend in the 
Cotswolds (30 minutes from Bath and Bristol), or go to London early 
(theaters, shopping).  What we all do for Enron.  

Please let me know if 10:30 Wednesday works for a conference call so that I 
can let the folks there know.  The UK is 6 hours ahead of the US, so if we 
need to push back later we can still do so, though it's getting into their 
evening if we go much past noon our time.

Sorry for the long message--I'm in a meeting late afternoon today and may not 
be available if you call.

At our Market Services Council meeting today I promised I would send around 
the Project Why information we have pulled together concerning the Activities 
and Tasks associated with each function within Market Services. Below is the 
current draft of Activities and Task associated with ET&S Gas Control. The 
other functions of Scheduling, Invoice/Billing, Contracts, and Electronic 
Business Development will be forwarded shortly. Since there are activities 
and tasks that involve areas outside of Market Services, I will be working 
with folks from TW/NNG Marketing (Lindy Donoho, Steve Gilbert, Jane Joyce), 
Finance (Dan Fancler), Business Consultant (Steve Klimesh), IT, and 
Regulatory.

The direction that I have given to my direct reports within Market Services 
on the scope of this phase of Project Why (as reflected in the draft 
attachment below) is as follows:
1. Identify the Activities and Tasks associated with Market Services 
functions (SEE Column 1 in attachment below),
2. Identify the Market Service function(s) responsible and/or other 
departments involved in this Activity/Task (SEE Column 2),
3. Identify the frequency of this Activity/Task (SEE Column 3),
4. Identify whether the Activity/Task is manual/semi-automated/automated (SEE 
Column 4),
5. The remaining columns(5,6 &7) in the attachment would be discussed later. 

I realize we discussed modifications to the format used below at today's 
meeting but I have not incorporated such changes yet. I am willing to discuss 
further so call with questions. More to come.

Thanks. Julia

Rod - we have discussed the accounting for plane uasage on year 2001 and have 
determined that  the actual trip costs will be billed direct to the user's 
RC.  However,  the 2001 budget costs for the plane have been included in Dan 
McCarty's executive RC budget.  Thus, we will have to develop a procedure to 
charge the RC for atctual costs, but credit the plane budget and maintain 
some control as to the overall status of the budget.

Who would you like me to work with to develop/coordinate these procedures?

Thanks!

Rod,

The ETS Operations Administration and P&SM organization will support all of 
the objectives listed below in whatever manner we can. but I feel that we can 
be most directly involved with the last one:

9).  E-Commerce Strategy

 We can work with the GSS organization to develop an E-Commerce Strategy and 
proceed with implementation.   Some specific areas that we need more 
development and implmentation of is the use of :

 "Payment on Receipts"  this eliminates the further processing of vendor 
invoices related to approved purchase orders.

 SAP Auto generated Purchase Orders.  - When we have designated NPA 
agreements in place for specific commodities, let the system convert the 
requisition to a purchase order and route to our preferred Supplier.

 Use of reverse EDI - allows vendors to input verbal orders to them into 
their Purchasing System and reverse create a "Purchase Order" into our SAP 
System.

 An E-Commerce system that can be implemented  anywhere within the Enron 
world that provides for a quick seamless transaction from "Cradle to Grave" - 
Requisition to Payment".

 Our implementation of an "Integrated Supplier" is allowing us test ground 
for many of these applications with an outside Supplier partner.

Morris

I would like to see a first draft of the 2001 goals & objectives by December 
11, 2000.

I specifically would like to see goals dealing with the following:

1.) Resolution of the Navajo Right -of- way issue;
2.) Development of a specific business plan for NNG's South End;
3.) Timetable for TW's new expansion;
4.) Timetable for the completion of FGT's Phase IV, Phase V, and PhaseVI;
5.) Pipeline safety legislation;
6.) Divesting of Enron's clean fuels business;
7.) Business developments efforts;
8.) NNG's Equivalent Unit Risk account  (how do we get our money back now !); 
and,
9.) E-Commerce Strategy.


We will discuss further at up-coming staff meetings.

We will add the new plan data to the historical file and sub-total like 
items.  We'll also work with Marketing to split revenues into categories that 
will help them, going back as far as we can.

I want to have the detail schedule fixed to include themost recent forecast 
and plans, including the plan for 2000.    Where there are obvious reclasses 
(like variable pay in 1999 vs 1998) then I want those made comparable.   This 
schedule has to somehow be made more usable.   I would suggest putting all 
the O&M and G&A in one bucket to avoid the shifting around explanations 
possibly.   Also on the revenue side can we get revenue broken down by North, 
South and Offshore?

I don't see any other items in the historical file like the Y2K costs.  It 
was an issue of whether these costs were truly incremental or not.  Over the 
years, there have been numerous shifts in philosophy regarding recurring 
versus non-recurring.  We have attempted to go back to 1993 and make the 
methodology more consistent between years with the information that we had 
available.

Tracy,  I will send you a revised Detail Income Statement file for the Plan 
because it includes 1999.

Subject: O&M Variance - 1998 to 2000

In 1999, we treated the increase in expense for Y2K as recurring, but 
reflected the deferral as non-recurring.  It probably would have been more 
appropriate to treat both the increase and deferral as non-recurring.  We 
will change the historical file to reflect that methodology.  This will 
decrease the 1999 recurring Direct O&M by $3.5MM on NNG and $.4MM on TW.  The 
attached file reflects the changes.  This does not have any effect on total 
O&M or IBIT, only the split between recurring and non-recurring.

Subject: O&M Variance - 1998 to 2000


Harry,  here is the explanation.  The biggest portion is the variable pay 
which was not part of G&A in 1998 $4.6MM and then we expensed Y2K of $3.5MM.

seems to address all important considerations. i would vote (manually) for a 
consistent apporach across all ETS managed activities. however i think it 
will receive resistence by selected project engineers - who tend to anly take 
respeonsiblity for a single facet of a project and not the whole project; and 
may think it slow down an already slow approval process

What do you think about using something like this proposal for most of our 
major projects (over $1.0 MM), could even go lower?   This has been proposed 
by Morris specifically for EOTT projects, but there is no reason to exclude 
others.

Dear Rod,
I want to thank you for meeting with the UH team last week.  I am looking
forward to a continued relationship with you and your colleagues at Enron.

I understand that both the undergraduate student and the MS in finance
student that I referred to you were happy to have received inquiries from
Enron.

A team of faculty in Finance has proposed development of an energy oriented
undergraduate curriculum in which students would take a program of study
leading to a specialization in energy.  We are developing a curriculum that
will cut across several units of the University as well as departments
within the Bauer College so that our students can take courses like
Petroleum and gas geology, Energy products and their production, Energy
history, The global energy map, discoveries, exploration etc.  This will
lead to a first-rate, full-time program for undergraduate students who will
earn a bba in Energy Finance or Energy Business.

The next step in our proposal is to create a five year
undergraduate/graduate course of study.  We contemplate that students in the
above mentioned Energy Finance/Business program will be able to apply for a
continuation of their study for a graduate degree. They will apply for an
advanced degree in the first semester of their senior year. If accepted,
they will begin taking our specially designed Energy Finance graduate
courses in the last semester of their senior year. These courses will also
apply toward the completion of their undergraduate degree. Moreover, these
students will then continue on for one more year of graduate course work, by
the end of which they will obtain an MS in Energy Finance degree.

We are currently in the formative stages of developing the curriculum for
this program.  To be successful, this program needs to develop with
participation of individuals within the energy sector.  We would love to
have some feedback from you and others in the industry regarding what they
see as the desirable set of tools and skills  that they would like graduates
of this program to have.  I was wondering if the Finance Faculty's
development team for this initiative could meet with you to discuss the
curriculum and illicit your view regarding how this program should develop.

Thank you again for your help.  I am looking forward to hearing from you
soon.

Best,
Ron

Rod,
Attached below is the draft Deal Approval Sheet for the Trailblazer 
construction project.  Jerry Martin mentioned that ETS might be interested in 
including an alternative in the bid response that offered a lease option on 
the deal.
Jerry has asked me to follow up with you on this possibility.  
What additional information would be helpful in considering the lease and 
what would be the next steps?

Arnold, 
Attached is the revised DASH for Trailblazer,  

In red on the first page the statement about the finance commitments needs to 
be changed, however, you should probably provide the verbage for that because 
you know what you want to say about the cancellation and cashflow curves. 

Also, some of the names for sign off like G. Matthews (spelling?) need to be 
verified and their project function should be verified also.

After you update the file, just e-mail the 2nd revision back to me.  

We should probably consider setting up a directory on the OTS server as we go 
forward to make the sharing of files easier.

We need a decision from the Business Units regarding the recommended (or 
standard) reporting / analysis tool for ENRON's SAP Data Warehouse.  This 
decision will be made by consensus (or at least by a majority of the Business 
Units).

We need both the correct Business and IT decision-makers to attend this 
meeting.  If you are not one of these people, please forward this invitation 
to the correct individuals in your Business Unit and ensure that they attend.

This meeting will take place on Thursday, June 8th from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m. in 
Conference Room EB46C1.

We have arranged to have both the BRIO and Business Objects vendors conduct 
demonstrations of their end-user reporting and analysis tools, plus their IT 
development tools.

Following the meeting, each attendee will be asked for their recommendation 
on the "corporate standard" package.  NOTE:  Individual Business Units can 
select (and purchase) the reporting/analysis tool of their choice, if it 
differs from the standard selected.

Please RSVP on this invitation so we know how many attendees to expect.  
Also, let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you, Pat Cagney

Rod

Thank you for the introduction.

For my part I am responsible for finance & Regulation at Wessex

Our work over the next month is to set out the heads of terms of contracts
between the regulated asset company and the new unregulated service company.

Attached is a note we have prepared setting out payment principles.  You
will see initial thoughts on issues such as who has what risk.

In considering this it may be useful to note some important points about the
UK Water industry, viz
1    The Licence holder (asset company) retains ultimate responsibility -
and criminal liability - for service delivery
2    The UK industry is very political and hence loose contracts are
necessary to deal with unexpected events.
3    The regulatory reporting requirements are very detailed & will require
annual information on the costs of both the Licence holder & (probably) the
service company

On the timing of your vist I am trying to arrange a tour of Wessex & its
assets for Thursday and or Friday next week.  You can also discuss some of
the issues on the contracts with the in house team.  unfortunatly I have
meeting with the regulator on the Thursday & am tied up much of Friday - but
it is probably better for you to spend time with people doing the  real work
rather than me.

Monday can be used for our meeting with the lawyers.  This will probably be
later in the day and go on into the evening.

I will get you a more detailed itinerary soon.

with best regards

Keith

As we are closing in on my arbitrary deadline, attached is the latest draft.  
It is relatively clean as Cooper has accepted most of our suggestions.  
Please note that Section 15D still needs to be re-worded as it references 
Exhibit H, which no longer exists.  Although most of you have not seen this 
document as a whole in a while, your input to various sections has been very 
helpful and I appreciate it.  As time is of the essence, I would be grateful 
for fresh eyes and perspective in what I hope will be a final read.  I hope 
to get this draft to Cooper by tomorrow morning.  For those prone to detail, 
the section numbers have been changed and therefore please pay attention to 
references to the numbers of other sections.  I would not want to reference 
the Force Majeure section when I meant to reference the Delivery section.

Cheers,

Michael

Reactive Power Capability Challenges Future Transmission
By Michael J. Zimmer
Baker & McKenzie
Washington, D.C.

A significant challenge to the transmission providers reported by the
National Electric Reliability Council (NERC) will be to maintain adequate
levels of reactive support for the transmission system in the era of open
market competition in the U.S.  Unlike real power (MW), the reactive
component of power (Mvar) cannot be easily transmitted over longer distances
and must generally be supplied at the local level.  Without adequate
reactive power support, portions of the electric power system can be
susceptible to potential voltage collapse or instability according to NERC.
Sources of reactive power include generators, synchronous condensers,
transmission lines, capacitors, and very specialized reactive support
devices generally known as static var compensators (SVCs).  Demand for
reactive power is shaped by the size and type of demand, power transactions
across the transmission system, and the loading of transmission facilities.
This demand for reactive power is growing nationwide.

Decline in Reactive Improvements

Many electric utilities made concerted efforts to improve reactive support
as demand grew by adding shunt capacitors on their distribution and
subtransmission systems, NERC reports.  However, such distribution reactive
improvement programs have declined in recent years within the industry.
Reactive support programs must be continuous as demand on the distribution
system continues to escalate.  A chief component of that growth in the need
for reactive improvement has been air conditioning which particularly
requires increasing levels of reactive support.  Most air conditioner demand
is motor load, requiring significant reactive power support.  Because of its
interaction with the transmission system, reactive support is one area that
distribution companies must not ignore if reliability is to be maintained on
the bulk transmission system.

The physics of transferring power across a transmission line causes it to
consume reactive power, with increased transfers resulting in escalating
voltage decline across the line.  When heavy power transfers occur across a
transmission system interface and transmission lines are heavily loaded,
voltage in the area of the interface can become depressed if sufficient
reactive supplies are not available to the system, NERC has stated.

Open Access Impacts

When transfers of power follow a consistent directional pattern, it is
relatively easy to plan and justify costs for the required reactive support
for the transfers.  For example, significant reactive support was added on
the bulk system to enable higher transfers from ECAR to MAAC and the VACAR
subregion of SERC in the early 1990s.  However, under open access
transmission, transactions are conducted in large numbers across long
distances, and often flow in directions that were not anticipated when the
transmission system was originally planned and built.  The direction and
amount of such transfers has become much more volatile, changing daily, and
sometimes hourly.  Consequently, planning reactive support enhancements for
improving transfer capability has become more difficult as the pace and
level of transactions have become more short-term and real-time.

There is currently no incentive to increase the levels of reactive support
on the bulk power system, NERC states.  In fact, there are disincentives,
because generators are paid to produce real power, not reactive power under
current contracting.  There is a tradeoff between producing real and
reactive power because reactive power generation decreases as the real
output increases.  A recent spate of nuclear unit upgrades effectively
lowered the units' reactive power output capabilities as the real output of
these nuclear units was increased.

In the long term, transmission providers must reevaluate their bulk power
systems in light of open access, including planning for necessary reactive
support.  Business is increasing on the transmission system, but very little
is being done to increase the load serving and transfer capability of the
bulk transmission system.  This will be essential for supporting development
of regional transmission organizations (RTO).  Most of the transmission
projects planned over the next ten years are intended to reinforce parts of
the system to alleviate local problems.

Future Planning Opportunities

This raises several issues for future planning:

* Can distributed generation become a new market source for reactive
power capability?
* Can distributed generation become a source of reliable transmission
loading relief avoidance?
* Is there a third party, competitive market for reactive power?  Is
there a merchant reactive power plant market to avoid voltage reduction
which should be encouraged?
* Who manages this critical bulk power system issue in a
post-restructured world?  Generators? Transmission? Distributors? Marketers?
* Will this issue become impaired further with distribution company
mergers and consolidations?
* Will most new transmission gravitate to reinforce the system for
local problems management, because of a lack of RTO's and strong regional
siting?  Are independent system operator's doing enough to manage this
challenge?
* Is this another incentive for the power quality market to respond?

The ability to transfer electric energy across interfaces or seams hampers
reactive power support.  NERC believes it is a national imperative that
reactive power improvements keep pace with the demands being placed on the
transmission systems to maintain reliability.  We are already seeing this as
an element of key market disruptions.  Reactive power support must
ultimately be placed and coordinated among generation, transmission and
distribution.  With existing regulatory structures, this could be falling in
the cracks with open access transmission, widely varying flow patterns and
associated reactive demands have become commonplace and need accommodation.
The reactive power support system will need to become more versatile for
open access transmission objectives to be achieved, and needs further
attention in the RTO formation process for RTO's to be successful and
thrive.

****

DID YOU KNOW?

* According to recent reports by the Edison Electric Institute, the
level of transmission investment in the U.S. has declined for over 20
successive years.

* The number of transmission load relief postings has escalated since
1998, transmission congestion is up 40% in 1998-9; and 140% in 1999-2000.

I'm unclear as to the appropriate accounting period; but -to me- the deal 
should revolve around the economics, and -as previously mentioned- if Kent 
and management believe prices are going to decline then a forward sale makes 
sense.

(But note that prices have continued to escalate sinse this deal was 
originally proposed)

Subject: SAP Financials Data Warehouse Update 07/18/2000


Below is an update on the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse Project.  Information 
has been divided into five areas: Infrastructure, Software, Rapid Mart 
Configuration, 'People' involved with project, and Training.  

Each area has a status color associated with it indicating how the project is 
done in terms of schedule.  RED represents trouble areas we are addressing, 
YELLOW represents potential slippage we are addressing and Green is for items 
"in good shape".  I am preparing an MS Project file and will publish it later 
this week to illustrate timelines in a graphical format.


I. INFRASTRUCTURE ACQUISITION and PREPARATION: RED

ACTA Application Server (UNIX):  Configured and being tested. 
ACTA Database Server (UNIX):  Received 7/7/2000.  O/S being added, internal 
drives on order (due 7/19), adding of Oracle DB Software will follow.  Target 
date to start Acta install and configuration is 7/26/2000.  
UNIX Database Storage: On order, due 8/9, estimated ready date 8/17.  Sense 
Corp. agrees that we can install and configure ACTA using internal drives 
until Storage arrives.  Not as critical to delivery date since initial Rapid 
Mart configuration can proceed using extra internal storage drives added to 
DB server (item 2 above).  Storage to be ready for install mid-August.
BRIO Broadcast Report and On-Demand Query Application Server (UNIX):  Ordered 
from SUN vendor 7/11/2000. 
Intranet WEB Server (UNIX):  Ordered from SUN vendor 7/11/2000.
Connectivity:  System Requirements forwarded to all technical contacts 
(7/18).  Meeting Thursday (7/20) with all technical groups and Sense Corp. 
consultant to cover ACTA System Requirements Document and ensure everyone 
understands details and can deliver on or before 7/26 target date.
The hardware mentioned in items 1 - 5 above make-up the DEV/QA environment 
for the SAP-Financials Data Warehouse.  The UNIX Infrastructure group 
recommendation is still to hold off ordering the Production environment 
machines.  Two reasons were cited:  
Wait so the performance of the DEV/QA boxes can be tested and determine if 
models originally identified for Production will be sufficient.
Wait to get feedback from customer groups on the value of the Data Warehouse 
deliverable and concept.  Frequently, Data Warehouses catch on quickly with 
the user community and they push to include much more information (in our 
case non-SAP data) into the data warehouse than originally anticipated.  


II. SOFTWARE ACQUISITION:  Green

ACTA software is purchased, in-house and paid for - installation awaits 
database server.
Confirmed that additional funds will not be needed for Oracle database 
software.  Meeting with GSS rep. Laine Borgman, Oracle rep. and NET WORKS 
contact Bob McAuliffe Monday 7/17 confirmed Enron has an enterprise license 
for the Oracle DB package.
BRIO Reporting and Querying software is in-house as free trial license 
through 7/31/00.  Tool has been selected by Enron Company business and IT 
group and is final stages of purchase process.  Target completion date is 
this Wednesday (7/19).  
Initial meeting on BRIO Training Wednesday (7/19) with Tennyson Group.  
Information and issues will be taken to initial Reporting Council meeting 
(7/27).


III. RAPID MART CONFIGURATION (Phase One of Project): YELLOW

ACTA consulting Partner, Sense Corp., is lined up to install ACTA and 
configuration of Rapid Marts.  Their paperwork for IT, HR and A/P is 
currently being completed.  
Received and reviewed Sense Corp. project plan and resource rates.  Project's 
budget can pay for Project Mgr. and two Acta Extraction Developers during

Hosts Disclaimer:  A good many people have been congratulating me on my 
creativity with this page, so I feel I must make it clear that I did not 
create the page, I am merely hosting it.  I originally received this as an 
email, but because many of my friends use email programs that cannot handle 
images, I decided to put it on a web page.  I do not know who originally 
created this page, but my congratulations go out to whoever did! 

Enjoy the page! 




RESIGNATION

I am hereby officially tendering 
my resignation as an adult. I  have 
decided I would like to accept the 
responsibilities of an 8  year-old [IMAGE]again. 

I want to go to McDonald's and think 
that it's a four star  restaurant. [IMAGE]

I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud 
puddle and make a  sidewalk with rocks. 

I want to think M&Ms[IMAGE]are better than 
money because you can eat  them. 

I want to lie under a big oak tree and 
run a lemonade stand  with my friends on 
a hot [IMAGE]summer's day. 

I want to return to a time when life was 
simple; When all you  knew were colors,  
multiplication tables, and nursery  
rhymes,[IMAGE]but that didn't bother you, 
because you didn't know what you  
didn't know and you didn't care. 

All you knew was to be happy [IMAGE]because you were blissfully unaware of 
all the  things that should make you 
worried or upset. 

I want to think the world is fair. 
That everyone is honest and  good. 

I want to believe that anything is 
possible. I want to be  oblivious 
to the complexities of life and be 
overly excited by the  little things [IMAGE]
again. 

I want to live simple again. I 
don't want my day to consist of  
computer crashes,[IMAGE]mountains of paperwork, 
depressing news, how to survive  more days 
in the month than there is money in the 
bank, doctor  bills,[IMAGE]gossip, illness, 
and loss of loved  ones. 

I want to believe in the power of 
smiles,[IMAGE]hugs, a kind word, truth, 
justice, peace, dreams, the  imagination, 
mankind, and making angels[IMAGE]in the snow. 

So . . . here's my checkbook 
and my car-keys, my credit card  bills 
and my 401K statements. I am officially 
resigning from  adulthood. 

And if you want to discuss this 
further, you'll have to catch  me 
first, cause........ 
......"Tag! You're  it." [IMAGE]

Pass this to someone and brighten 
their day by helping them  remember 
the Simple [IMAGE]things in Life. 
((((((((((((((HUGS)))))))))))))) 

[IMAGE]

Hope Ya'll join  me !

Hello Everyone,

I spoke to Mike Sullivan about a week back, and I suggested that the 
Financial Site Managers get together for lunch to catch up on what other 
business units were doing to make SAP a BIG SUCCESS.  I may have missed a few 
Financial Site Managers, so make sure you let me know if we need to add more 
people to the lunch reservation.

Stan.  Per your request, here is the update for the first three Year 2000 
Goals and Objectives for ETS.

1.  We obtained our FERC certificate, completed construction on the Ft. Myers 
lateral, and made initial deliveries to FPL at their plant on October 1.  

2.  We have obtained a very favorable Preliminary Determination on our Phase 
V project, in spite of having significantly revised the filing on August 1 to 
include TECO in the Phase V project.  FERC staff is working on issuing our 
Environmental Impact Statement, which has been delayed due to the TECO 
filing.   We remain on target, however, for timely receipt of our certificate 
to allow construction by the second quarter of next year.

3.  Mr. Hayes and is team are continuing negotiations with prospective 
shippers for a Phase VI project.


If you have any questions, please call me.

Rock

You are invited to attend a "brief" ETS PRC review meeting on Monday, 
December 11.  

One purpose of this meeting is to review the performance distribution in each 
ETS Division (i.e., percentage of employees at each performance level) to 
ensure comparability across the organization.  Human Resources will provide 
performance distribution charts to each of you for your organizations based 
on the results of your PRC meetings.

The second purpose is to review the performance ratings of the Managers and 
Directors/Sr. Directors in your organization, particularly focusing on those 
individuals being recommended for promotion.  Ratings will be reviewed for 
all, but a detailed discussion of each individual's performance is not 
intended.  

The hoped for outcome of this meeting is to reach consensus prior to, and 
minimize surprises during, the final ETS PRC meeting scheduled for December 
15.  This will allow us to focus the majority of that meeting on the 
performance of ETS' Officers.  

Meeting details:
When:  December 11
Where:  EB49C2
Time:  11:00 AM-3:00 PM (lunch will be served)

The cash flows for 2001 are currently locked, but if we get a chance to 
adjust for carry forwards we will.   Worst case is that the dollars will have 
to be reapproved as outside of the budget.     Likely that we will be able to 
do some internal moving of dollars to compensate for this, but not guarenteed.

Subject: Revenue Management Expenditures

While talking with Kim and Martha a question was asked  on capital budgeting 
for Revenue Management..  The question has to do with carrying over 
previously  approved dollars from 2000 to 2001.

The facts ($millions) :

2000 Revenue Management Budget:

$5.7 - Original RM Phase one approval
$(1.0)  In July 00, this amount was approved to spend in 2001 (in the 2001 
budget as a line item)
$4.7    Expected expenditures in 2000 for Phase one.


$(1.0) Current assessment of money not needed for Phase one deliverables 
(estimated, may still change)
$3.7     Amount  approved  with current work-orders
$  .8     Possible amount to be carried over and spent in 2001 
$2.9     Phase one amount to be spent in 2000


2001 Revenue Management Budget:

$ 1.0   Phase one approved carryover  (in 2001 budget)
$  .8  Estimated additional carryover   (not currently in 2001 budget)
$3.0 Phase two   ( in 2001 budget  in the Marketing Pool)
$ 4.8  Total to be  spent in 2000

Question:  
Since the $.8 was approved and is covered in the existing work-orders, can 
this be additive to the 2001 budget without any further approval - even 
though it is not currently a line item in the 2001 budget?  Or does the  $.8 
have to be offset against the Marketing Pool?

If this $.8 does go against the Marketing pool of $15.0 million, will the 
revenues generated from Revenue Management  reduce the revenues generated 
from the pool?  In other words If the capital dollars from the pool are 
reduced because of RM will the revenues also be reduced?

I have attached the resume of a good friend of mine who is starting to look 
for a job.  For the last year or so he has been running his own company, but 
prior to that he has worked in the energy business, primarily in power.  He 
is trying to get a better sense of Enron, better than I could tell him, and I 
thought you would be a good person for him to speak with.  Please let me know 
if you would be willing to meet with him and I can make the arrangements.

Thanks,

Michael

I guess I would only request that we get some review put in front of ETS' new 
Risk Management Officer and his crew, Jerry Peters.    I also understand that 
this is a part of the Revenue Management project.

Subject: ETS Risk System

Rod,
Caroline forwarded me your questions regarding the Risk System so I wanted to 
go ahead and respond since Steve is out this week.

I don't think Philippe requires the level of due diligence that we performed, 
but we were getting questioned on buying a 3rd party product vs. using an 
Enron Risk System.  We did more research and got the other groups involved so 
that they would understand our decision.  I believe everyone is now 
comfortable with our purchase decision.

In our analysis of systems, we selected the Caminus product in part because 
we had several individual references from Arthur Andersen, Deliotte &Touche 
and Ernst & Young.  These organizations, especially Arthur Andersen, have 
audited this application and have actually participated in numerous 
implementations.  Ernst & Young recently selected Caminus for Equitable 
Resources.   Arthur Anderson implemented the application for Conoco and 5 or 
6 other companies, and Deloitte Touche recently selected the product for 
Tractabel.  After talking with individuals from these accounting firms, we 
felt very confident that the product was sound, and we should not have audit 
concerns.  Obviously, we have a lot of business procedures that have to be 
established, and there is time in the work plan to do that work, but a lot of 
those decisions drive how the application is configured so we need to get the 
product purchased work through the details of how we implement the new 
business procedures since the system does drive a lot of processes. 

Regarding costs, we have an approved work order for $650,000 which covers all 
the initial hardware, software, implementation costs and first year 
maintenance.  This cost does represent a very limited implementation with 
only 10 concurrent users, no customization except a few reports, and no 
electronic interfaces or data conversion.  The assumption is that initially 
the volume would be so low that an automated interface may not be cost 
justified, and the data would manually be loaded since it was low volume as 
well.  The on-going costs are estimated at approximately $100,000/year.  We 
did not perform a separate cost/benefit analysis as this was in the original 
cost of the Revenue Management RAROC.  Let me know if you have any other 
questions or there are open issues that we need to address prior to 
completing the contract.  We are hoping to get this signed and the project 
underway next week.  Thanks.

Subject: Trip to Wessex

I'm not sure what you have heard back from the crew in Bristol/Bath, but I 
found them to be very interested in achieving maximum success.    There was a 
lot of learning on my part, but I'm now more convinced than ever that Wessex 
is very much like our gas pipeline business.    Even to the fact that the 
internal regulatory types don't believe the regulators will approve it.     I 
have offered continuing assistance as needed (in fact have a conference call 
setup for tomorrow).    I was able to give them the benefit of my experiences 
and tried to create analogies to our experiences here.   In some cases I'm 
sure it made a difference, in others the group may actually be in front of 
some of our thinking.    I think I can see an opportunity to expand the 
thinking on both sides of "the pond" in the regulated businesses  with just 
some simple contacts and have promised to help them at least start 
conversations with more counterparts in the pipeline group.    

Let me know how you want me to charge you the travel costs.     I can submit 
the claim here and bill you or I can submit the claim to you.

Before the Apollo Cut-over Team can create GPG's FAR orders the business unit 
needs to determine the make up of the FAR orders required for each cost 
center (how many and what are they).  We can identify field assets to be 
tracked by the FAR orders; however, development of the FERC IDs for the 
orders will be the responsibility of the various GPG accounting groups.
Please plan to attend a meeting to develop a strategy for the completion this 
task.  The meeting will take place, Tuesday, April 25, 9:00 a.m. - 11:30 
a.m.  The room location will be communicated prior to the meeting. If you 
know of other individuals who should attend this meeting, please feel free to 
invite them.
Accurate assignment of the FERC IDs to the FAR orders is critical.  This step 
will determine the accuracy of  GPG's O&M expense translation from SAP's 
natural accounts to the FERC accounts.  
Please call me at (713) 853-5292 if you have any questions.

We will cover the following agenda items:
Overview of FAR Order and functionality (very brief)
How are the FERC IDs used to facilitate data translation for FERC reporting
One to one relationship between FERC ID and FERC Account
Use of a variant for the FERC ID
Who in GPG will identify FERC IDs for each Cost Center's FAR Orders
Assignment of tasks, by operating group, to achieve completion on or before 
May 9th (to be included in FIT 3)

Regarding objective #8 on the  Pipeline Group 2000 objectives,  you should 
consider the  NNG base gas sale as a major contributor in meeting and 
exceeding this objective.   I discussed this with Dan McCarty and he  
suggested I send you a note to include it in the first pass.  If you need any 
help on the amount etc, let me know.
