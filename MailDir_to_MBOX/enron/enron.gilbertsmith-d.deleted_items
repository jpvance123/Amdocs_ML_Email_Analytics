Subject: PRS 1/28-29 Meeting  Agenda
This forwarded  note announces Protocol Revision Subcommittee's next meeting, which is  scheduled for January 28 - 19, 2002 at ERCOT Met Center.  The first 8  agenda items deal with pending Protocol Revision Requests.  Two PRR's  impact the Retail Market; 304 Unexecutable and 310 Estimating Usage Applied to  Profiles.  The ninth agenda item is for PRS to begin prioritizing systems  changes.  This is a critical activity in defining what changes will be in  v1.5 release. 
Brenda Crockett and  I are actively working on having RMS representation at this meeting.  We  hope to have information for you before the end of this week. This certainly  does not preclude any market participant attending this meeting.  Brenda  and I feel the coordination between PRS and RMS is very critical at this  junction that we what assigned representation at these meetings.

A question, am I correct that the LSE status being referred to is NOT EPMI - if so, is it with EES?  or what entity?

Charles,

I think that we are better off just conveying the clean LSE over to NETCO and then registering as an REP in the event we need to. The QSE needs to be re done as the last one is messy.

Thanks,

Doug

I am researching with ERCOT staff, the timing requirements for QSE, LSE and TCR registration.  They are not on the website.

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline".

We have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

Our planned Re-Launch timetable is as follows:


Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with the new Buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Subusers.

A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		
Trading/Origination Coordination

We will shortly be sending you an invitation to join a meeting in which we will be discussing launch plans in more detail and looking for people to help in contacting customers on our Top 50 list. Although we have a dedicated EnronOnline marketing team, we would appreciate assistance from traders and originators who have strong relationships with our customers and can assist in getting signed PA's returned to us.

If you have any questions please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

What's up then?
You gathered Bruce never made the connection - Friday's abort was due to
a plane crash in Birmingham backing everything up at Aberdeen and
everywhere else.
Delivered him Saturday night, he overnighted in Aberdeen, checked in for
his 10:35 y/day a.m. and by 3:00 it still hadn't left, so he would have
missed yet another connection in Amsterdam. That was actually OK as I
spoke to the guy in Jordan who said Amman was snowed in!
The good bit is - he's got his appointment with the specialist on
Wednesday afternoon to discuss the knee. I've also booked him in with
the surgery to discuss depression etc.
Tomorrow we are down and up from Glasgow to renew a passport which is
too full to get a new Saudi visa - what a start to the year.
Anyway - let's have your news - thought you were having a meeting today?
lots of love

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

I have lost all respect for wall street-do not combine the commodity picture with the equities.

Whoever wants to be long 70000 MW of assets and turbines while straddled
with the associated debt payments.  Someone who weathers the energy storm
and still has capital.  Potentially a bank with exposure?  How big daddy
Koch :-)

The real issue is that wall street is realizing that their growth story is
over.

You do not need a FERC license for Texas-ERCOT.  You do need to qualify with ERCOT and PUCT.

Christi,

Can you check and see if we need a FERC license for ERCOT? I am thinking that we can avoid it and just qualify with the PUCT and ISO.

Please let me know,

Thanks,

Doug

I can get this moving as soon as we have the company identity and bank info in hand.  Bill Rust has all the forms in a file and a list of the items we will need to complete the forms.  Smith will work with ERCOT to get the testing started.  We also need a check for $500 to start.

Also, there are bankruptcy issues associated with transferring something from Enron to Netco and the license may not be transferable.  Charles is going to check further as to exactly what would be transferred and what (software?) costs are associated with this.  Thanks.

Charles,

I think that we are better off just conveying the clean LSE over to NETCO and then registering as an REP in the event we need to. The QSE needs to be re done as the last one is messy.

Doug

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

In an effort to determine any transaction changes that may be required to
support the Muni/Co-ops we are asking that you develop any questions that
you feel need to be answered.  This is especially important for the CRs.
Please submit your questions to Rita.Morales@exolink.com.  She will compile
the questions and send to the TxSET list serve.  Please have all questions
to Rita by Friday February 8th.  Thanks for your careful consideration of

Who owns the ISA/IEA and GS/GE Control Segments doc?

I have a suggestion for it...

It might be helpful to have information something like this in it:

The GS06 (Group Control Number) of the sender's EDI GS envelope is
used in the responding 997 transaction to enable 997 reconciliation.
It is returned to the sender in the 997's AK102 element.

In other words, the GS06 and AK102 elements are used in reconciling
outbound EDI transactions with the inbound Functional
Acknowledgments (997).

There is no provision in the ANSI X12.5 standard for returning an
ISA number in a 997.

Interchange acknowledgment and reconciliation is enabled with the
responding TA1 segment:

<<QUOTE FROM X12 standard>>
Interchange Acknowledgment TA1

To report the status of processing a
received interchange header and trailer or
the non-delivery by a network provider

CONTROL SEGMENT
TRANSACTION SETS USED IN:
None
REF ELE ID ATTRIBUTES NAME
01 I12 Interchange Control Number N0 9/9 M
02 I08 Interchange Date DT 6/6 M
03 I09 Interchange Time TM 4/4 M
04 I17 Interchange Acknowledgment Code ID 1/1 M
05 I18 Interchange Note Code ID 3/3 M
<<ENDQUOTE FROM X12 standard>>

<<<NOTE FROM D.DARNELL>>>
I could find no reference to TA1 segments in our TX SET documents..
so if there is somebody please point me to it. The TA1 segment may
be worthy of future discussion in the TX SET work group.

Meanwhile .... I would recommend that the GS06 (GS control number)
always be unique for a trading partner/functional group. You could
do this by incrementing by one every time you ran a map... and then
storing the last GS06 sent for use by the map (to increment) next
time around. If you ALWAYS have only one Functional Group per ISA..
then you could make the GS06 the same as the ISA control number
(ISA13).

COMMENTS??

Dave

Oncor TDSP will be re-sending, this week, the 814_04 transactions (count of
4,471)  identified as outstanding on the current ERCOT Siebel database. As
these transactions date back to December 17th, we were of the understanding
that ERCOT would be re-dropping the transactions in the date range of
December 17th through January 17th, as we understood that these
transactions were involved in the ERCOT "paperfree" issue. We apologize for
our misunderstanding.

MARKET NOTIFICATION OF SYSTEM CHANGE

PIP Number(s):        144, 200



PRR Number(s):       294



Protocol Section(s):   4.4.4, 6.3.1, 11.4.1.1



Implementation Date:     January 18, 2002



Description of System Change:

ERCOT plans to implement PIP 144/PRR 294 (Load Ratio Shares per LSE) and
PIP 200 (LSE Load Ratio and Loss Allocation) on January 18, 2002.   The
Protocol revision for PIP 144 impacts sections 4.4.4 and 6.3.1 of the
Protocols.  The revision for PIP 200 is documented in section 11.4.1.1
of the protocols.

Currently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE
for a given trade day based on the QSE's aggregated Load Ratio Share as
of the same day of the prior week.  This results in the use of QSE/LSE
relationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service
obligations.  When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the
obligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old
QSE for one week after the effective date of the switch.  The same
obligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week
after the switch.  QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data
per LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations.

This modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are
aggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on
the QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for
which obligations are being posted.  Load Ratio Shares will be
calculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for
initial settlement of the trade day in question.  QSE Load Ratio Share
will then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the
sum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding
to the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day.

Scheduled Extract Changes:  Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio
Shares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract.  Each QSE will
have the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it
represents.  Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load
extract with its Load Ratio Share information.

Dynamic Extract:  The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive
extracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract
folder added called "Obligations".  This dynamic extract folder will
have two extracts called "QSE obligations" and "LSE obligations" which
can be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE.  The following
ERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above:

?        Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT)

?        Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT)

?        Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT)

?        Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT)



You can find details of PRR-294 at the following link:
http://www.ercot.com/AboutERCOT/PublicDisclosure/ProtocolRev.htm .

If you have any questions, please call your ERCOT client service
representative.

Pepco to Supply Electricity in  Maryland
Beginning in July of this year, Pepco Energy Services  will provide electri=
city to sixteen Maryland state agencies. The contract is  worth nearly $65 =
million for 1.6 billion kilowatt-hours, to be provided over a  two year per=
iod. Six percent of the total electricity supply will be generated  from re=
newable resources. This award from the State of Maryland is the latest of  =
$800 million worth of contracts for Pepco's services awarded within the  la=
st two years.
New Mexico Passes Electric Energy Policy
On  January 8th, the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) passed=
 a  resolution adopting a new electric energy policy for the state, despite=
 the fact  that the New Mexico legislature had earlier postponed deregulati=
on until  2007. Principles of the NMPRC policy include requiring utilities =
to operate  adequate distribution infrastructure, requesting an in-depth an=
alysis of New  Mexico's transmission system, redesigning retail rates, and =
considering  alternative forms of regulation. Commission staff noted that "=
without  legislative intervention to repeal the restructuring act, the comm=
ission's  energy principles [can] be implemented only on a temporary basis.=
"

Seven New Power Plants for New Mexico
Five power  companies serving customers in New Mexico have committed to bui=
ld  seven new power plants in the state between now and the inception of  d=
eregulation. These seven plants are expected to generate 2,200 MW of new  e=
lectricity supply. The power companies include Duke Energy, Public Service =
 Company of New Mexico, Tri-State Generation and Transmission, Peabody Ener=
gy,  and Cobisa Corporation, all of which have begun construction or are st=
ill in the  planning stages.

Exelon CEO Supports Continued Deregulation  Efforts
Speaking at an energy conference at the Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago, E=
xelon co-CEO John Rowe said that the nation cannot return to  the failed re=
gulatory structures of the past. Referring to Enron's  bankruptcy and Calif=
ornia's energy crisis, Rowe noted that "The grand experiment  has had some =
fairly substantial hiccups, [but] we can't go back to our  grandfather's Ol=
dsmobile." He also urged FERC to establish RTOs and disagreed  with the age=
ncy's November decision to give up price setting responsibility for  three =
large U.S. utilities.

Deregulation ad campaign denounced
The Ontario  government will launch a $2.3-million series of television ads=
 to publicize the  arrival of competition in the electricity market, but th=
e opposition denounces  the campaign as "propaganda." "This isn't about pub=
lic information; this is  about brainwashing," NDP Leader Howard Hampton sa=
id yesterday. "It's just  fundamentally wrong." Mr. Hampton said advertisin=
g industry sources told him the  government was planning five different tel=
evision spots to announce that private  companies will be allowed to sell e=
lectricity to consumers starting May 1. The  government responded that only=
 one ad was produced, as part of a broader  campaign to educate consumers a=
bout their choices under the new system. The  brief piece resembles many of=
 the other ads produced by the Progressive  Conservative government, some o=
f which have been criticized for trying to  bolster public support for cont=
roversial policies. Soft-focus pictures of  smiling people in everyday sett=
ings run underneath a voice track explaining why  deregulation of Ontario's=
 electricity is necessary. "As we grow, we're going to  need more electrici=
ty," says the advertisement's voice-over. "And more companies  generating e=
lectricity." "We're not trying to sell privatization," said Mike  Krizanc, =
a spokesman for the Ministry of Energy, Science and Technology. He  noted t=
hat the ads are part of an education campaign for which the government  has=
 handed out almost a million eight-page pamphlets about changes to the  ele=
ctricity system. Ministry officials are also holding public meetings around=
  the province, particularly with seniors who might be confused about their=
 new  choices. "This is . . . a propaganda campaign to try to turn around p=
ublic  opinion," Mr. Hampton said.
New Requirements for ESCOs in New York
The New  York State Public Service Commission has approved new financial re=
quirements for  energy service companies, or ESCOs. ESCOs doing business in=
 New York will now  have to meet a minimum bond rating from an independent =
rating agency before  offering prepayment plans or requiring security depos=
its. ESCOs that do not earn  the minimum rating will have to put security d=
eposits in escrow or issue an  irrevocable letter of credit; they will not =
be allowed to offer prepayment  plans. PSC Chairwoman Maureen Helmer explai=
ned last week that, "the additional  consumer protections balance key inter=
ests in the energy markets. Specifically,  our administrative flexibility e=
nables us to balance vital consumer interests  with the interest in offerin=
g innovative competitive energy services."
Problems in Texas Leave Customers Without  Electricity
Recent reports of pitfalls in Texas' newly  deregulated electricity market =
note that some customers are being left without  electricity for several da=
ys. Reportedly, deregulation is complicating the way  that orders for new e=
lectricity service are placed and processed, in that  consumers may select =
from a number of retail electricity providers (REPs) when  they decide to o=
rder new service or switch to a different provider. After being  notified b=
y a customer, the provider must contact ERCOT, the Electric  Reliability Co=
uncil of Texas. ERCOT, which is responsible for managing the power  grid, t=
hen notifies the current utility that its customer has opted to change  ser=
vice. Before January 1, 2002, only the regulated utility needed to be  cont=
acted; now there are three different entities involved with the change. The=
  usual wait for a service change had been 24 to 48 hours. Now, it typicall=
y takes  two to five days. The Houston Chronicle is reporting that one Hous=
ton family  endured 10 days without electricity while waiting for power in =
their new  apartment. Tom Noel, ERCOT's president and chief executive offic=
er, explained  that "we've traded off reduced rates for a little less conve=
nience. In other  words, in the past when there was a monopoly utility in t=
his city, they  [consumers] made one phone call, and that was the only part=
y they needed to  call." This issue had impacted enough consumers to cause =
the state's Public  Utility Commission to place it on the agenda at last we=
ek's open meeting. Terry  Hadley, a spokesman for the Austin-based commissi=
on, said that the delays are of  concern to the commission and that it is l=
ooking to improve the process.
Cost of Ontario Hydro subsidies revealed
Fearful  that competition would lead to sharply higher electricity prices, =
a group of  Ontario industrial companies persuaded the province to give the=
m a subsidy  extension worth up to $197-million. Records on the size of the=
 subsidy were  obtained by Canadian newspaper "The Globe and Mail" through =
the  freedom-of-information legislation. It is the first time the amount of=
 the price  break given by the Progressive Conservative government has been=
 made public. The  records also indicate that the Ministry of Energy viewed=
 major  electricity-consuming companies as hypocrites, because they publicl=
y called for  power-market competition while privately demanding a continua=
tion of the subsidy  that allows them to buy electricity at below-market pr=
ices. Big companies, such  as Dofasco Inc., Bowater Pulp and Paper Canada I=
nc., and up to 79 other large  electricity users, will continue to receive =
the subsidy when the Ontario  electricity market opens for competition on M=
ay 1. The extension could last for  up to four years. Subsidized power was =
first offered by Ontario Hydro in 1993,  when the company was looking for w=
ays to increase demand through what were  termed "special rate" deals. Sinc=
e then, about 7 per cent of Ontario's  electricity has been covered by thes=
e deals, which were supposed to end when the  electricity market was opened=
 to competition. Companies receiving the subsidies  would suddenly face pri=
ce increases of up to 64 per cent, the records say. The  cost of the subsid=
ies will be carried by Ontario Power Generation, one of  Ontario Hydro's su=
ccessor companies, and Ontario Electricity Financial Corp.,  the body payin=
g off Ontario Hydro's debts, according to the records. The  documents show =
that senior executives at big companies began pressuring Premier  Mike Harr=
is, former finance minister Ernie Eves, and Energy Minister Jim Wilson  in =
1999, threatening that if the government didn't continue the subsidy, the  =
company's investments in the province would be at risk. In June of 2000, ca=
binet  approved continuing the subsidies through regulation, despite an ass=
essment by  the Ministry of Energy that said Ontario Power Generation could=
 lose up to  $190-million over four years, compared with selling the electr=
icity at market  prices. Ontario Electricity Financial Corp. would receive =
$7-million less in  dividends over that period.
"Price to Beat" Set in Virginia
The Virginia State  Corporation Commission announced this week that a "pric=
e to beat" electricity  rate has been set as a benchmark for cost compariso=
n in the state's developing  deregulated electricity market. The rate will =
be reset on a yearly basis.  Electricity suppliers wishing to compete in th=
e market must offer service at a  lower rate or provide a unique service su=
ch as a green power package. The actual  price to compare for a particular =
customer will vary depending on usage and the  rate schedule of the existin=
g electric company, but the average price to compare  is 3.3 cents per kilo=
watt-hour for residential customers. During the state's  pilot customer cho=
ice program, some Virginia Power customers chose to switch to  Dominion whi=
ch charges between 4.35 cents and 4.97 cents per kilowatt-hour for  electri=
city. At the time of the pilot, these rates were competitive with  rates of=
fered by other utilities serving customers in Virginia. The SCC is now  cau=
tioning those customers to reconsider their switch based on the new "price =
to  beat" rate. A spokesman from Dominion said last week that the company h=
as no  immediate plans to lower its rates, but is pleased that new rates ha=
ve been  announced, stating, "We have a number we can shoot at. We welcome =
 it." Customers who switch their electricity supplier in the new market mus=
t  also consider the transition charge they must pay for the next 5  years.=
 This charge was created to compensate utilities for losses on  investments=
 they made previously to serve those customers. Two licensed  competitors, =
Old Mill Power Company and AES New Energy Incorporated, have  requested tha=
t the charge be phased out. Some concern has been expressed that  the low b=
enchmark price makes it difficult for new retail electricity suppliers  to =
enter the market. Eric Matheson, AES New Energy's director of new  markets,=
 is arguing that the low price makes it "impossible" for his company to  co=
mpete with incumbent utilities in Virginia.
Efforts to Deregulate Electricity Will Be Slowed
A  top DOE official told reporters this week that efforts to deregulate the=
  electricity market in the United States will be slowed for years due to t=
he  collapse of Enron Corporation and the well-documented energy crisis in =
 California.  Vicky Bailey, Assistant Secretary for International Affairs  =
and Domestic Policy, said that the ramifications of California's crisis and=
 the  fall of Enron could slow the progress of electricity deregulation for=
 two to  three years.  She does not expect this to end further developments=
 in  deregulation throughout the country however. Bailey, a former Federal =
Energy  Regulatory Commission member, believes that Enron's absence may hur=
t the  industry's push toward deregulation, but competition will ultimately=
 prevail.  The restructuring issue she added is "larger than Enron" and too=
 much progress  has been made in support of restructuring to go back to reg=
ulated markets.
Long Island Opens to Retail Competition
The Long  Island Power Authority (LIPA) has announced that is has completel=
y opened the  island's electricity market to retail competition under the L=
IChoice  Program.  This achievement is seven years ahead of the schedule im=
posed by  the Public Authorities Control Board (PACB) in May 1998 and a yea=
r in advance of  LIPA's own 2003 deadline.  Under LIPA's retail competition=
 program, three  Energy Services Companies (ESCOs) have been certified to s=
upply electricity to  residential and commercial customers on Long Island. =
 Currently, 38,039  residential and commercial customers receive approximat=
ely 220.4 MW of  electricity from ConEd Solutions, NIMO Energy Marketing or=
 KeySpan Energy  Solutions.  LIPA has invited the Suffolk County Electrical=
 Agency (SCEA) to  formally participate in the customer choice program as w=
ell and hopes it will  sell as much electricity as it can obtain under its =
ESCO provisions. LIPA  Chairman Richard M. Kessel hopes that these efforts =
will encourage more ESCOs to  join the market.  LIPA has also increased the=
 Energy Bill Credit, or  shopping credit, from 3.5 cents per kilowatt-hour =
to 4.5 cents per kilowatt-hour  to further encourage competition within the=
 market.  This credit is equal  to the cost of generation-related energy an=
d capacity costs that LIPA avoids  when an ESCO takes over provision of ele=
ctric service.  The funds derived  from the credit are returned to the ESCO=
 to help cover its generation  costs.  It is hoped that the increase will p=
rovide ESCOs with a greater  incentive to supply competitively priced elect=
ricity to consumers.  Retail  deregulation in the state began in May 1998 w=
hen LIPA first reduced electric  rates by an average of 20%, resulting in s=
avings of $1.5 billion.  LIChoice  began its phased-in approach to deregula=
tion in April 1999, followed by a second  phase in May 2000.
Florida Loses Interest In Deregulation
Interest in  a deregulated electricity marketplace in Florida has waned con=
siderably over the  past few months.  Despite the findings of the Florida E=
nergy 2020 Study  Commission's December report that recommended initiation =
of a competitive  wholesale market, little additional discussion has occurr=
ed, and the state  Legislature is not expected to act on the recommendation=
s in the report.   The Orlando Sentinel reported last week that the Legisla=
ture has other, more  critical issues on its agenda, including the recessio=
n, reapportionment, and the  state's response to terrorism.  Sanford Berg, =
a 2020 Commission member who  directs the Public Utilities Research Center =
at the University of Florida,  explained that the Legislature is preoccupie=
d as well with congressional  redistricting and the state's budget crisis. =
 He also mentioned that the  Energy Commission's report will require substa=
ntial analysis which the  Legislature does not have time to do.  The bankru=
ptcy of Enron Corporation  has also contributed to a lack of interest in de=
regulation.  The company's  collapse has caused stakeholders in Florida to =
question the ability of  electricity generators and transmission and distri=
bution companies to supply  uninterrupted flows of power at an affordable p=
rice.  Despite the lack of  deregulation in Florida, the electricity market=
 in the state appears to be  stable and healthy.  The state's large power c=
ompanies are consistently  profitable and have been able to adjust customer=
 prices as compensation for  investments in new generating plants and fluct=
uations in fuel costs.  The  utilities do not expect wide variations in fue=
l costs in the coming year and  believe they have sufficient generating cap=
acity to cover the demand for  power.  Creation of a regional transmission =
organization (RTO) to serve the  state is not planned, regardless of collab=
orative efforts during 2001 to form a  statewide RTO, Grid Florida.  This p=
lan has been stalled due to the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission's pre=
ference for interstate RTOs.
North Carolina Study Commission To Resume
The  Study Commission on the Future of Electric Service in North Carolina w=
ill resume  on February 6, 2002.  Deliberations on electric deregulation ar=
e not  expected to take center stage; rather, the Commission's work to reso=
lve the debt  burden of several towns and cities will likely be the focus o=
f discussion.   In April 2000, the Commission approved a set of recommendat=
ions that included  moving to a fee-market system for all power sales in th=
e state by 2006.   California's energy crisis, however, resulted in the Com=
mission's design to  delay these plans.  Commission Co-Chairman Senator Dav=
id Hoyle (D-Gaston)  told reporters this week that the he does not expect t=
he panel to make any major  recommendations before legislators convene May =
28th for the 2002 session.   He also noted that the Commission is expecting=
 updates from other states on  their electricity deregulation activities an=
d plans in addition to a report on  available power supplies for the state'=
s 4 million electric customers.   Senator Kay Hagan  (D-Guilford) agrees wi=
th Senator Hoyle and does not  expect the Commission to move forward with d=
eregulation plans.  "This is so  complex that it's not easy to even figure =
out what questions to ask," she said.  North Carolina regulators are expect=
ed to closely follow electricity  restructuring in the neighboring state of=
 Virginia.
Pennsylvania Utility Denies Market  Manipulation
PPL Corporation, headquartered in Allentown,  Pennsylvania, has denied char=
ges that it set artificially high prices for  wholesale products in its ser=
vice territory.  The Pennsylvania Public  Utility Commission (PUC) is inves=
tigating PPL in the aftermath of charges  leveled at it from PJM Interconne=
ction LLC, the wholesale market operator, and  NewPower Holdings Incorporat=
ed.  PPL claims that a "readily foreseeable  increase in demand" resulted i=
n price increases during the first quarter of 2001  rather than an effort t=
o control prices.  The PUC is interested in the case  because these price c=
ontrol charges pose questions about the success of the  state's deregulated=
 electricity market.  PJM required that electric  companies under its juris=
diction have the ability to meet 119% of their expected  demand.  Therefore=
, PPL's high prices have a negative effect on competing  electric companies=
, which often purchase supplemental generating capacity from  the utility. =
 NewPower, which serves 192,000 Pennsylvania customers, called  last year's=
 market prices "unjust and unreasonable."  Other electric  companies and co=
nsumer advocates are following the case closely to judge its  potential con=
sequences for the future of electric competition.  John  Hanger, a former P=
UC commissioner and now head of PennFuture, a Harrisburg  consumer interest=
 group, said that "nobody believes that there wasn't market  manipulation g=
oing on."  PPL contests in its filing to the PUC that the  price increases =
did not prevent alternative electricity suppliers from competing  at the re=
tail level nor did they affect consumers negatively. Most consumers in  the=
 mid-Atlantic region are protected from price fluctuations by rate caps so =
 they did not directly feel the effects of higher wholesale prices.  Hanger=
  maintained that retail suppliers began leaving the market following the h=
igh  prices in March of 2001.  The PUC confirmed that only 72 of the origin=
al 97  electric companies operating in the Mid-Atlantic region last January=
 are still  in the market.

I think I can get Jeff King done with a simple title change from Associate Director to Director with no salary change.   His current salary is already Director level type comp.   I potentially may need another 25k, but the title is a "feel good" issue that is important to Jeff.   Please talk to Doug directly on the justification.

Louise,

Seung-Taek Oh will be working for me as the head of real-time markets in Ercot. As a two year associate he would have been eligible for promotion to manager. He was also an UBS employee and as such was an associate director. I would like to change his title from undefined to associate director.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Doug

Charles,

I think that we are better off just conveying the clean LSE over to NETCO and then registering as an REP in the event we need to. The QSE needs to be re done as the last one is messy.

Thanks,

Doug

Hello to All,


     Jeanette Harris and I will not be available to attend the RMS Open
Meeting held on January 31, 2002, but we wanted to keep everyone up to date
concerning the Outage Proof of Concept Project and the team's progress.  I
had an opportunity to call Don Bender (RMS Chair) to request that Jeanette
be removed from the RMS agenda and he was very gracious and agreed to this
request.  (Don, thanks again)  The team will be available to attend the
next scheduled RMS open meeting to provide another status update.      We
did not want to leave any one out of the process concerning any of this
information so please feel free to forward these two documents to anyone
that you feel would be interested in this project and it's progress.  We
want to continue to have open communications with all market participants.

WSJ(1/14)Heard On The Street:Enron Ex-CEO Made Bet Vs. Rival 		

01/13/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


  By Ken Brown 
  Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal 

When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. "I've missed too many soccer games over the years," he told his brother Tom soon after he quit. 

But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival. 

A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is "way out of the ballpark" on the high side. 

The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. "There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on," Ms. Leone says. 

As CEO of Enron, which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets, Mr. Skilling was used to taking on risk. He pushed the company into several unproven businesses, including the trading of bandwidth, or network capacity, a market that ultimately didn't prove successful for the Houston company. Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall; the company has been under bankruptcy-court protection since early last month. 

But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky. In short sales, investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them, hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones. Such trades are riskier than buying a company's shares directly, because if the stock rises strongly, an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to "cover" the bet at a sky-high cost. 

As it turns out, AES shares, along with those of other energy companies, fell steadily in the month after Mr. Skilling's resignation. Then on Sept. 26, AES stock tanked, falling by nearly 50%, when the company announced it wouldn't meet analysts' earnings estimates for 2001. If Mr. Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date, he could have earned better than 60% on his investment. 

AES, based in Arlington, Va., blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency. AES wouldn't comment on Mr. Skilling's trading. "Commenting on another company's now-departed executive's behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make," says Kenneth Woodcock, a company spokesman. 

Mr. Skilling's bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AES's business because of his work at Enron. Ms. Leone, his spokeswoman, says Mr. Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July 30 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency. Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked, he felt that the company's stock might fall in price. His trading decision was "absolutely not" based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive, she says. 

AES did trade energy with Enron, but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output, rather than to earn a profit, according to Mr. Woodcock. He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr. Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enron's dealings with his company. 

The trade was made through Mr. Skilling's account at Charles Schwab & Co., the big discount broker, and it created a buzz inside the firm's San Francisco offices. After the position was taken, "we checked up on it a couple of days later, and a couple of days after that, and said, oh, it went down," says the person familiar with the trade. 

At the time of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Schwab executives in their newly opened private-client office in Houston were trying to sell Mr. Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock, the person says. Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy, called a collar, but Mr. Skilling never acted on it, a decision that may have cost him millions, the person says. Mr. Skilling wouldn't comment on the collar proposal. 

At the time of his resignation on Aug. 14, the 1.1 million Enron shares that Mr. Skilling owned outright were worth about $47 million. He also had 500,000 vested options that were in the money, meaning their exercise price was below the stock's share price at the time. Mr. Skilling has said he sold about 500,000 of the shares he owned outright on Sept. 17, when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks. That sale would have netted him about $15 million, based on that day's volatile prices. 

His remaining 600,000 shares are worth $408,000 at Enron's current share price of 68 cents, and his options are worthless. Just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright, the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr. Skilling more than $30 million. 

Interestingly, professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival, on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles, the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position. But Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the trade wasn't a hedge, adding that it was the "first and only time" he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr. Skilling owns is Enron. "If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares; he didn't," Ms. Leone says. 

Enron and Schwab, which were often paired in magazine articles touting America's most innovative companies, had at least one minor business relationship. Schwab had handled a small portion of Enron's 401(k) called the "brokerage window," which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the company's plan, as well as individual stocks for their 401(k)s. The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced. 

Mr. Skilling isn't the only member of his family to suffer because of Enron's collapse. His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman, bought 750 shares of Enron at $49 early last year "because of these incredible analyst reviews" of the company. He says he sold them in the fall at $27 to buy some land. "Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a 60-cent stock," he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska. 

He says his father suffered more: He bought 2,000 shares of Enron last year and still holds them. "You wonder what in God's name were the analysts doing," Tom Skilling says. "There were a lot of people lulled into, I don't know what, a comatose state."

It is hard  to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.
Want to  attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.
There are a lot  of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have some
material  which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss.  
Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?

I have  a clarification question.
 
As I  understand this question relates to change control #2001-232 which is to have  all 824's for 867's go point-to-point instead of thru ERCOT.  The notes say  that it is hoped that this process will be implemented by  mid-January.
 
In  some of the last notes I saw from the RMS 867 Contigency Plan - the plan  referenced that 824's for 867 rejects would go to ERCOT but 824's for duplicates  would not.
 
It  seems the two are in conflict.  When the change control gets implemented -  is the plan to update the 867 Contigency plan so that no 824's will go to  ERCOT.
 
In  developing our systems we are trying to determine if all 824's will be  point-to-point in the future.
 
Thanks  for any clarification.
 
Jennifer

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

HERE IS THE TEXT.  IT WAS IN THE SUN.

Blair to let EU arrest Brits
By GEORGE -PASCOE-WATSON
Deputy Political Editor


TONY Blair was last night slammed for handing EU judges the power to arrest
British citizens on trumped-up charges over laws which do not EXIST in the
UK.

The PM will sign up to an EU-wide arrest warrant today - despite warnings
that it is open to abuse and a massive surrender of power.

It will mean that anyone can be seized and handed over to a EU country to
face trial, even if they have done nothing wrong under British laws.

Last night the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues said British
citizens will be at the mercy of third rate legal systems like Greece and
Portugal.

Vice President Michel Tubiana said: "It presupposes that all judicial
systems function well.

"All you can say with certainty is that NO system functions perfectly.

"One cannot rule out the possibility that the European arrest warrant could
be widened to other crimes, or abused.

"There is no guarantee preventing this."

Last night Downing Street brushed off the attack and insisted Mr Blair will
OK the deal.

It means that people can be arrested in Britain on any one of 32 measures at
the whim of foreign magistrates.
They include offences like xenophobia and swindling.

British police officers will be expected to arrest citizens on the orders of
the foreign courts - a huge change in the UK's constitution.

The idea is part of the international crackdown on global terrorism.

It ensures that suspects will be fast-tracked to justice and barred from
using the appeals system to stay ahead of the law.

But critics want to know why many crimes have been included which have
nothing to do with terrorism.

Rape is on the list - a crime easy to allege but often difficult to prove.

Yet under the plan, "suspects" would have NO right to challenge evidence put
forward for their extradition by a
foreign magistrate.

All 15 EU leaders will sign the pact during talks in Laeken, Belgium.

MPs here will not get a chance to debate the measure until it becomes part
of a new Extradition Bill in February.

   Here's a bit about something that's fairly scary.  I'm sure Bruce must
   have
   a few pointed words about this type of thing...

   Hang in there...


   Later,

Christi,

Can you check and see if we need a FERC license for ERCOT? I am thinking that we can avoid it and just qualify with the PUCT and ISO.

Please let me know,

Thanks,

Doug

RMS decided at its last meeting to select January 29th as the starting date for the 867.03 Contingency Plan.  One of the activities during the trail use of this plan was to conduct a conference call with MPs to kick-off this effort.  Late this afternoon, we were able to resolve some coordination miss-cues which resulted in this late meeting notice, and to that extent, I apologized to everyone. 
Tuesday, January 29th at  10am - 11am CDT will be the kick-off conference call.  The phone number is 1-800-373-0950 with an Access Code of 1014.  The suggested agenda is: 
Market Participant Roll Call; Don Bender 
Sign Off of Test Plan; Shirley Whyte 
Readiness of TDSPs to Implement; TDSPs 
CR Readiness to Receive 867.03's from TDSPs; CR 
CR Reconciliation of TDSP & ERCOT Information; Don Bender 
Next Call

As a reminder to all market participants, a REP does not have to wait until
the recission period expires before it sends the switch request in to ERCOT.
In many scenarios, a customer may wish for a REP to expedite handling of
their request and the REP is willing to balance the risk of  customer
cancellation against a customer's desire to receive service in a hurry.
Although this is not the same "customer protection" period identified below,
it may help expedite some service requests.  Further the PUC would like to
remind market participants of the their obligations as highlighted in the
rule below.  The commission is receiving too many calls from customers who
have not been provided accurate information from their REP and/or from REPs
who merely blame another party for the delays.

Specifically, Substantive rule ?25.474(i) states the following:

	(i) Submission of customer's selection to the registration agent. A
REP may submit a customer's selection of the REP to the registration agent
prior to the expiration of the cancellation period prescribed by subsection
(h) of this section. Additionally, the REP shall submit the switch request
to the registration agent at the proper time so that the switch will be
processed on the date agreed to by the customer and as allowed by the tariff
of the transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or
electric cooperative. The customer shall be informed of the scheduled date
that the customer will begin receiving electric service from the REP, and of
any delays in meeting that date. Additionally, the REP must advise the
registration agent of any "special needs" customers and renew such
notification to the registration agent annually.

It was asked that ERCOT also provide a chart for customers who must follow
the customer protection period.



Please review through the attached documentation. (thank you Dave Odle for
providing this)




4 days (trans Processing) + 3 days (mailing time) + 7 days (customer
protection period) + 2 days (TDSP read time).

Basically...  16 days.



4 days (trans Processing) = Business Days

3 days (mailing time) = Postal Business Days... Sunday/Holidays are NOT
Postal Business Days.

7 days (Customer Protection Period) = Calendar Days

2 days (TDSP Read Time) = Business Days

TOTAL = 16 Days



10 Calendar Days + 6 Business Days

Update - additional clarification from the ERCOT Registration Department
regarding First Available Switch Date where customer waives the protection
period. (Customers other than residential and small commercial may agree to
waive this Customer notification as provided in PUCT rules and regulations.)

Please review through the attached documentation.

Receive Date + 7 business days which would allow for the first 24 hours in
ERCOT's systems for the processing of the inbound switch.  Please remember -
business days does not include holidays/week-ends.

The attached document was sent out to RMS sometime back in November from
Dave Odle.


This should assist all MP to get switches to process correctly the first
time submitted.

In order for a switch to be accepted, CRs should use the following
calculations when they send in a switch request for commercial or industrial
customers that waive their customer cancellation period.



non-protected switch (notification waiver = Y)

- calculate FirstSwitchDate = (6 business days (1 day in, 2 TDSP, 1 day out,
2 early read))



If the switch you request is less than 6 business days away, the system will
reject it as requested before first available switch date.

I can get this moving as soon as we have the company identity and bank info in hand.  Bill Rust has all the forms in a file and a list of the items we will need to complete the forms.  Smith will work with ERCOT to get the testing started.  We also need a check for $500 to start.

I think the confusion begins with the fact that the contingency plan was developed before the 824 work group met to develop the plan.  Don Bender worked on the contingency plan and will bring this issue up at the RMS meeting tomorrow.

I have a clarification question.
As I understand this question relates to change control #2001-232 which is
to have all 824's for 867's go point-to-point instead of thru ERCOT.  The
notes say that it is hoped that this process will be implemented by
mid-January.
In some of the last notes I saw from the RMS 867 Contigency Plan - the plan
referenced that 824's for 867 rejects would go to ERCOT but 824's for
duplicates would not.
It seems the two are in conflict.  When the change control gets implemented
- is the plan to update the 867 Contigency plan so that no 824's will go to
ERCOT.
In developing our systems we are trying to determine if all 824's will be
point-to-point in the future.
Thanks for any clarification.

Christi

Here is a compehensive list for TX power marketer, aggregator and REP registration.

Note - I spoke with Jan Bergan at the PUCT and got clarification that there is no official form or PUCT registration response time requirements to be a TX power marketer.  NETCO may operate as a power marketer without any PUCT approvals. Aggregator and REP certs are more stringent.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Kyle,

Hot topics make it even more important to reschedule this meeting.

We get into problems by rushing into making decisions when we are not
prepared.  We decide something without the correct information and then
later, after we spend resources on this, we make additional changes which
cost additional resources.

One week would not hurt us.  In my opinion, it makes sense to take an extra
week or so to have the information provided up front for review and get
prepared for a meeting.

Also, it is hard to rearrange a work schedule at the last minute.

Some people who might want to attend/participate may not be able to do so.
There may not be anyone from Entergy attending and participating.  And, as
you know, we do attend and participate.

We have too many hot topics to let this get pushed.  Sorry about the
short notice, but I think SET really needs this meeting this week.  Just
my opinion though.

Importance:	High

The attachment reflects updates reviewed this afternoon arising out of additional credit war room files. Please note that the following counterparties should now be considered to have terminated their wholesale power enabling agreements with EPMI, and performance under any transactions with such parties, if any, should cease: 

AES New Energy, 
Cargill Alliant LLC, 
CP&L, 
OG&E, and 
Southern Illinois Power Cooperative.    

Rainbow and Split Rock have indicated that it was not their intention under their previous correspondence to have terminated, though EPMI may ultimately contest this (no right to partial termination).

Please contact me with any questions, or additional information you may obtain.  David Portz (ext 39239)

Kyle,

My question on #8 had more to do with the wording of the minutes of the MIMO
meeting on Oct. 25.  I knew that Entergy's tariff allowed same day move ins.
The point of the question was that the way the minutes were worded, it
appeared impossible to handle.  Some SET members on the call last week
thought it might have been a typo in the minutes.   They said "According the
minutes of the move in/move out meeting on Oct. 25, under "Rejection of MIMO
for a Date in the Past", there was a 'strong
recommendation' that CR's not send move in dates less than current date +1
day."   Several people commented they thought it should have said "current
date -1 day."   That would allow you to request a same day move in.

This was supposed to be discussed in Austin today or tomorrow.

Thanks,

Heidi,

I have no way of being able to discuss cost implications of changing the
post card language, since I do not know the current costs and have not
reviewed the ERCOT contract for the customer care center.  Prior to the
meeting, could someone at ERCOT forward that information including a break
out for the mailing cost and also invite a person from the subcontractor to
prepare estimates on the costs associated with the changes (such as going to
a larger card or envelope to assure that customers get all the necessary
information to make an informed decision)?

Also, could we begin at 2 instead of 1?   Three hours should be more than
adequate and the time conflicts with another PUC/Gov. office function.

Dave,
We have too many hot topics to let this get pushed.  Sorry about the
short notice, but I think SET really needs this meeting this week.  Just
my opinion though.

It is hard to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.

Want to attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.

There are a lot of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have
some
material which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss.

Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?

In an earlier note this week, you receive information on Protocol Revision Subcommittee's (PRS) next meeting scheduled for January 28 -29, 2002 at ERCOT's Met Center.  Most of their two day agenda is to prioritize all the received system change requests.  RMS will have a number of  Texas SET representatives there and some companies are sending additional employees who are familiar with our Protocol Revision Requests (PRR).  Susan Neel, Texas SET Chair, will be our primary representative.  If you are sending additional representatives, please inform Susan who will be attending from your company. 
Subsequent to my earlier note, I received a request from the PRS Chair for RMS to collectively as a subcommittee, prioritized all RMS approved PRRs.  That list was to be submitted to PRS this afternoon.  I expressed my concerns to the PRS Chair of the short turn around time on this request (48 hours) and the challenges RMS voting members and RMS market participants will face in accomplishing this with such short notice.  Come to find out, PRS' see the PRR prioritization process as just getting started, with additional opportunities for RMS to provide input on our priorities.  Thus, no harm done for now by not prioritizing our PRRs.   
Susan Neel will provide us an update from this PRS meeting at our January 31st RMS meeting.  At that time, we may need to develop a process for RMS to prioritize its PRRs.

RMS chair has expressed concerns over the number of calls he has been receiving on the confusion with the 867_03 contingency. 
If you have technical concerns or issues with the RMS approved 867_03 contingency plan, it is imperative that you email those concerns to me or Heidi (heidi.schrab@greenmountain.com) by close of business today! 
The texas Set group that is meeting in Austin tomorrow and Wednesday to begin data gathering for version 1.5, will  address your issues/concerns as the first agenda item for tomorrow. We will email the results of this discussion on Tuesday afternoon.

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Doug-

Take a look at this spreadsheet I made and let me know what you think.  It takes the BES interval prices from the operating day reports and computes the following:
	
	Hourly average for each zone
	Hourly average ERCOT wide
	Daily peak average by zone and ERCOT wide
	Daily offpeak average by zone and ERCOT wide

It only is updated as often as they update their operating reports but I think it's still a useful tool for looking at prices over time.  Maybe will benefit from some graphs - spreads - both???

I have a clarification question.

As I understand this question relates to change control #2001-232 which is
to have all 824's for 867's go point-to-point instead of thru ERCOT.  The
notes say that it is hoped that this process will be implemented by
mid-January.

In some of the last notes I saw from the RMS 867 Contigency Plan - the plan
referenced that 824's for 867 rejects would go to ERCOT but 824's for
duplicates would not.

It seems the two are in conflict.  When the change control gets implemented
- is the plan to update the 867 Contigency plan so that no 824's will go to
ERCOT.

In developing our systems we are trying to determine if all 824's will be
point-to-point in the future.

Thanks for any clarification.

Jennifer

15 days prior to scheduling, the QSE must have the registration form submitted to ERCOT.
 
The real critical path is the QSE testing.
QSE testing which is dependent on the test flights. It is unclear to me from the website where that resides. Smith may already know. I will follow up with the testers.  

We can start trading as soon as we can get trading contracts in place with other marketers.  But we cannot schedule.  However, we can use another QSE of course.

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Former Enron Executives Launch Celeren Corp.

01/14/2002 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
PHILADELPHIA -(Dow Jones)- Several former Enron Corp. (ENE) executives launched Celeren Corp., a new company formed to provide risk management energy services through the sale of energy outsource products and independent power generation services. 
In a press release Monday, Celeren said it will guarantee long-term fixed costs rather than the traditional saving guarantees offered by most energy service companies in the market. It will focus on small- to mid-sized businesses and institutions where it sees the most growth. 
Thomas A. Brigger, formerly Mid-Atlantic regional manager for Enron Energy Services' energy outsource fulfillment operation, will serve as Celeren's president and chief executive. 
Donald S. Parker, previously Mid-Atlantic regional director, asset risk management, for Enron Energy Services, will serve as Celeren's chief operating officer and on the company's board. 
Brigger and Parker, along with other members of Celeren's executive team, left Enron in July to start Celeren. 
"We created Celeren Corp. as a nimble energy company that will serve the unique risk management and energy utilization challenges faced by today's small-and mid-sized businesses by offering a valuable financial instrument," Brigger said in a statement.

at this time, pure retail will be less of a focus. We need to wait and see where that ends up for EES.

In light of the current events at Enron, it is necessary for me to
resign my position as RMS Chair effective immediately.  I have enjoyed
working with everyone.  I am very grateful for the opportunities
afforded me by chairing RMS.  This position took a lot of work,
dedication and energy but it is one that also made me proud and gave me
a wonderful opportunity to work with so many fine people.    I am
confident that with all of your hard work and dedication the Texas
market will be successful and will be the hallmark for restructuring. 

My employment with Enron will be formally terminated tomorrow along with
service at this email address.  I am in the process of setting up a
personal email address which I will distribute as soon as it is
available.  My phone number listed below will stay in service
indefinitely.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or
require any information.  Thanks again to all of you and good luck.

Clint,

Not sure that is the right way to go about it as it is not what people are looking for off the bat. I would focus on the resume.

Hope you had a good New Year.

Take care,

Is there a standard process for each TDSP on how CR's should handle notifying a TDSP if they are aware that a premise address needs to be changed? 
Couple of examples below. 
A customer is notified by the post office that the post office is changing their premise address and they call their CR to notify them in order to recieve their bill correctly. 
CR receives information from return mail processing, etc, that a premise address should be changed.   
The 814_20 is for communications from the TDSP to Ercot to the CR, but does not provide for communication back the other way.  Should the customer be directed to the TDSP phone centers or what is the best means to communicate these change requests?

The tentative plan is to have me working in the Fundamentals Group.  Of course, as with most things of late, there are no guarantees.  On a different note, I spoke with Alex regarding the load aggregation/portfolio piece.  It was not intended to be part of pSim, but it's development was not completed, so that may not really matter.

Carrie,

     The issues you mentioned discussing tomorrow aren't SET issues and should
not be put on the agenda for tomorrow's meeting.  The meeting isn't even a SET
meeting.  The small group is meeting to discuss and finalize the plans for 1.5.
If there are questions concerning the issues then RMS should take up those
issues.  They have already developed and approved the plans they are
questioning.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

All they want is a scapegoat for the $140 MM paid out and as we did not make money off it I will not be the scapegoat. Having talked to them previously regarding balanced/unbalanced schedules they will not want the discussion to be diverted.

Thursday works for me.

Doug --

It seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.  I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly. I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?

Let's sit down on Thursday am and talk.

We have an issue.   Example:   A customer calls the CR and states that they
need to have their meter removed   ( temporary meter for construction).
The meter is the only meter on the ESI-ID.  So the CR needs to send a
move-out 814_24 request.  Originally, the market stated that the CR would
place remarks of "Please remove meter".  Problem is that the 814_24 does
not have an text segment for any type of remarks.   Version 1.5 should have
a remove-meter request segment.  However, in the mean time what should we
do.  I suggest that the CR send in the 814_24 move-out request and after
receipt of the 814_25 they call the TDSP and ask that the meter be removed.

FROM Dr Arusi Agbara.
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN INTERNATIONAL BANK.
LOME-TOGO.
TEL:00228-911-40-37.
FAX:00228-222-45-84

DEAR,
                   (CONFIDETIAL PLEASE)

I am Dr Arusi Agbara, chief accountant for the bills
and credits in the foreign remittance dept. section of

African International Bank Lome-Togo in west Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact
you on a business transaction that will be very
beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction.

During our investigation and auditting in this bank,
my
department came across a very huge sum of money
belonging to a deceased person who died on november
1992 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in
his account with this Bank without any claim of the
fund in our custody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret
within myself and partner to enable the whole plans
and idea be Profitable and successful during the time
of execution. The said amount was $6,500,000.00usd(six
million five hundred thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through my good friends who works with
chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
in Lome-Togo. It is him who recommended your person
to me to be viable and capable to champion a business
of such magnitude without any problem .

Meanwhile all the whole arrangements to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer this money to a
foreign account has been put in place and directives
and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
as you indicate your interest and willingness to
assist us and also benefit your self to this great
business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
time
of transfer because I work in this bank.

This is the actual reason why it will require a second
party or fellow who will forward claims as the next of
kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and
also present a foreign account where he will need the
money to be re-transferred into, on his request as it
may be after due verification and clarification by the
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money
will be remitted from to your own designation bank
account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction
is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of this
transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total
sum as gratification, while 10% will be set aside to
take care of expenses that may arise during the time
of transfer and also telephone and fax bills, while
60% will be for me and my partner.

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as
we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank
until you confirm the money in your account. and ask
us
to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
of the fund according to percentage.

previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary information will be sent to
you
when I hear from you. I suggest you get back to me as
soon as possible, stating your wish in this deal.

Yours faithfully,
Dr.Arusi Agbara.

It is hard to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.

Want to attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.

There are a lot of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have some
material which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss.

Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?

Shelley, the market left the 814_PC transaction (Maintain customer Information request) in place so that the CR could notify the TDSP when changes like the one you mention were necessary.  It is a point to point transaction from the CR to the TDSP.

Is there a standard process for each TDSP on how CR's should handle notifying a TDSP if they are aware that a premise address needs to be changed? 
Couple of examples below. 
A customer is notified by the post office that the post office is changing their premise address and they call their CR to notify them in order to recieve their bill correctly. 
CR receives information from return mail processing, etc, that a premise address should be changed.   
The 814_20 is for communications from the TDSP to Ercot to the CR, but does not provide for communication back the other way.  Should the customer be directed to the TDSP phone centers or what is the best means to communicate these change requests?

Yes Dave... you are right.  Thank you for cetching this crucial error.
All,
For your own records, please change the "1" to a "2" on the "2001-***"
of the
Change Control Forms where the year is inaccurate.
I attempted to cetch this on all of them and inadvertently allowed a few
to slip
through...

Please reference the numbers Dave R. mentions below...

Again I apologize for the sending the notice so late.  We just got our wires crossed.........hopefully this won't happen in the future.  Regardless, I beg that all will make an exception this time, since most of you knew that we were planning on these dates!

It is hard to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.
Want to attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.
There are a lot of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have some
material which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss. 
Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?

Subject:  Premise Type

Johnny/Paul, I followed up with IT to determine how quickly we could get
the Premise Type removed from the 814_04 and found out that Registration is
not sending the field on the 814_04.

CR #1176, which added the Premise Type to the 814_04 for Texas SET v1.4,
shows a status of complete.  However, the CR is not complete as
Registration is unable to send the field on the 814_04 until the 814_04
implementation guide is complete.

In short, we should not have to make any changes to remove functionality.
Let me know if you have any questions.

Paul

Thanks David.

I have asked Mark Taylor to see if the ERCOT team could speak with Bryan Murtaugh at 1pm Thursday (in 38c2).  The purpose is simply to walk through the documents to ensure that UBS can sign-off as quickly as possible.  We will know, hopefully, by mid morning tomorrow.

I'll send another note with the final plans.

Jim

Subject:	RE: UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).  

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account. 

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:  

TXU Energy Trading 
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.

Subject:	UBS Sign-Off on ERCOT Docs

UBS Legal and UBS Credit is heading to Houston this Thursday and Friday.  I have asked that ERCOT matters get 1 hour to discuss the necessary contracts that UBS will need to sign to participate in the ERCOT market.

Basically, my understanding is the following --

1.	PUCT Registration Form for Power Marketer
2.	ERCOT ISO Information
	QSE [Portz, David]   N/A until IT platform is ready for UBS to serve as its own QSE 
	LSE [Portz, David]   N/A 
	Wholesale Enabling Agreement [Portz, David]   No ERCOT  involvement 
	Other [Portz, David]   REC Trading Account Agreement  
3.	APX Agreement [Portz, David]   initially
4.	Other

Given the list of issues, this assumes that UBSW Energy will not be selling electricity at retail.  If we need this for Day 1, we would have to get an additional license from the PUCT.

Thanks,

Jim

We looked at this data and found that if you look at it on a percentage basis you are skewing the story. I explained to her in an email what we did and what our positions had been (generally) so they should put two and two together. This is a mute point at this stage as we no longer exist.

I told them that if they have specific questions then we would be more than happy to answer them.

Thanks,

Doug

Doug --

The PUCT called out of the blue and indicate that they would like to talk with you about this information.  Have they communicated with you about this?

The  814_PC does not have anything in it for address other than the postal code, at  this time.

Shelley, the  market left the 814_PC transaction (Maintain customer Information request) in  place so that the CR could notify the TDSP when changes like the one you  mention were necessary.  It is a point to point transaction from the CR  to the TDSP.

Is there a standard process for each TDSP on how CR's should handle  notifying a TDSP if they are aware that a premise address needs to be changed?  
Couple of examples below. 
A customer is notified by the  post office that the post office is changing their premise address and they  call their CR to notify them in order to recieve their bill correctly. 
CR  receives information from return mail processing, etc, that a premise address  should be changed.    
The 814_20 is for communications  from the TDSP to Ercot to the CR, but does not provide for communication back  the other way.  Should the customer be directed to the TDSP phone centers  or what is the best means to communicate these change requests?
