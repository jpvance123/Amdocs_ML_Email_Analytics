I attended a meeting on competitive bidding and the following information emerged:

1. Cinergy does not plan to wait until 12/05 to end the Market Development Period (MDP) and in fact indicated that it may petition to end it for some customer classes prior to 12/03.  Public Authority switching rate is in the teens.  Must of that load is off-peak street lighting so there may be some opportunites when that opens up.  In the settlement, we negotiated that the shopping credit would continue even if the MDP ended early so our positions should be protected.

2.  AEP endorsed a model very similar to ours and that would indicate that they want to get out of the default service function.  They are stuck, however, until they reach at least 20%.  There may be some opportunities for us in light of the slow motion in dereg in their service territory and their desire to shed these customers.

3. FE will file next month a revision for next year for the market price of MSG and the shopping credit.  From what they told me privately, the market price will go up in accordance with the schedule, but because they have exceeded the 20% switch requirement in some customer classes, the percentage differential between market price and shopping credit will remain the same and not escalate.  Of critical importance will be to evaluate how they have come up with the percentages.  

4.  DPL kept pushing that in order for a marketer to competitively bid it had to have generation to back up the bid.  I think I killed that argument, with, ironically, AEP's assistance.  But what this tells me is that DPL is looking for buyers of its generation.  So maybe there is an opportunity to acquire load following generation from them.

Below is a Motion I prepared and filed for EES to get a waiver from the PUCO limiting small commercial contracts to a 2 year term.  If granted, this will allow Enron Direct to blitz the market.  The plan is that for the first 25 MW of load that Rogers Herndon's group tries to do on a physical delivery basis in the Cinergy teritory, that the customers be the small commercial ones marketed by Enron Direct.  (The value proposition on a two year deal is very thin but four years works).
 
A similar motion filed by Strategic Energy was denied last year.  Prior to filing, I talked with several commissioners and Staff and I think our chances are reasonable (60% chance of success).  I'll keep you posted.

Based on present rules, the biggest challenges include our ability to maintain firm transmission service with the requirement to designate resources and the fact that imbalance prices are set by CG&E.  After we meet with MISO next week and CG&E the following Tuesday, we should have a much better handle on how life will look under MISO and be in a better position to determine if a special negotiation with Cinergy would be beneficial.  

I will advise further after this,

Rogers and Jeff;

In a discussion today with one of Cinergy's attorneys, I received confirmation that they are interested in ending the market development period early, if they think it is in their economic interests to do so.  This would require them to have 20% of their customers in any of their given customer classes switched to a competitive supplier.  At this point on the commercial side they are at 6%.  The attorney indicated Cinergy's belief (when last he checked) that electric prices would decrease during the first two years of the transition period (01 - 02) and then rise the last three years.  The higher the prices rise, the more willing Cinergy is to unload its customer base and continue to collect regulatory assets.  Of concern to Cinergy also is the ability to find a home for all their generation once their customers start to leave.  

Cinergy appears interested in talking should Enron or any marketer want to do so.  I know we have broached this question in the past and thought I would put it before you in the event you think there might be an opportunity to negotiate an arrangement whereby we can leverage a deal that improves our physical delivery capability.  If the time is not right at this moment, this is something to keep in mind for a later date.  

Janine

Rick, here's the contact information.  We received a call this morning from 
our local MO political consultant Cagle that Ameren is applying extreme 
political pressure to move the bill.  It would be best for Ken to call Kinder 
on Friday, when Kinder is in his office in Cape Girardeau.  Number there is 
573-335-6611.

Subject: Missouri genco bill issues and a proposed strategy

(from Barbara and Kerry)

Ameren UE has been successful in developing political support for a bill that 
would permit each Missouri IOU to transfer its generation assets to a genco 
at net book value.  The genco would enter into a five-year term purchased 
power arrangement with the utility, with subsequent minimum three-year term 
renewals.  Each utility transferring its generation assets would be required 
to establish a "dedicated supply" tariff for large customers, who could elect 
to obtain energy from alternative suppliers in a buy-through arrangement.  
Alternative suppliers would be required to sell dedicated supply to the 
utility in a wholesale transaction; the utility would transport the power to 
the large customers, who, from an operational perspective, remain native load 
customers of the utility.  

The Senate Commerce and Environment Committee has passed the bill, which will 
be considered by the Senate sometime in the next several weeks.  If the 
Senate passes the bill, the debate will resume in the House.  Legislators are 
interested in moving the bill because they believe it will improve 
reliability of supply in Missouri.  Ameren UE has postponed building 
generation, and will require an additional 800 MW for next summer.  In the 
wake of the California situation, the legislative interest is not in 
providing a competitive discipline to the marketplace.  Ameren has promoted a 
genco structure as necessary for mitigating the investment community's 
concern over regulatory risk associated with building new generation 
facilities under traditional rate of return regulation.

There are a number of problems with the bill. From a retail aspect, it will 
be difficult if not impossible to compete for large customers, who will be 
able to procure power from the utility at FERC established cost-based rates 
that are currently below market.  In its present form the bill does not 
include meaningful code of conduct provisions, and it permits the utility to 
enter into billing and metering "experiments" in which customers can be 
aggregated and sold utility services at unregulated rates.  Although the bill 
requires that rates for utilities establishing gencos must be reestablished 
in rate cases within twelve months prior to  the transfer of generation 
assets, it is unclear the extent to which rates will be unbundled.  Finally, 
alternative generation suppliers and their customers would be subject to 
balancing charges, which render physical transactions untenable at this time.

 From the wholesale perspective, the bill is unacceptable because incremental 
resources required to serve Missouri retail load are not required to be 
competitively procured.  An earlier version of the bill would have permitted 
competitive procurement of additional generation sources at the utility's 
discretion, but was removed at the request of the Missouri PSC staff, who are 
sensitive to the legislature's focus on the issue of reliability.

The bill is sponsored by President Pro-Tem Peter Kinder, who in the past 
introduced comprehensive legislation that required competitive procurement 
for customers not choosing alternative supply sources.  Although Senator 
Kinder told Barbara and Roy Cagle that he would support passage of a bill 
this year, he does not appear to be taking an active interest in the details 
of the legislation.

Senator Kinder belonged to the same fraternity at the University of Missouri 
as Ken Lay, though they didn't attend college together.  Senator Kinder has 
voiced his admiration of Ken Lay, and met him at the Republican Convention 
this year.  It might be possible to persuade Senator Kinder to improve the 
bill, if Ken Lay were to communicate personally with him.

We recommend that Senator Kinder be persuaded to alter the bill to require 
competitive procurement for incremental generation resources.  On the basis 
of our discussions with EES and ENA, it appears that taking steps to address 
retail market structure problems will not put us in a position to compete 
effectively for large customers in the short and mid term.       

Barbara and I will prepare briefing materials for Ken Lay, if you wish to 
proceed in this fashion.  Please advise.

A phone call was held today.  Some issues / actions from the call ---

1. Right now it appears that this would be announced around June 5 at the 
Mayor's regular press meeting.  Checking this out.  Need to make sure that PR 
will be able to cover the meeting and answer any background the press may 
have on us.

2. Deal team wants Enron PR to meet with DEP PR next week (May 30?) to begin 
working up the Mayor's statement on the benefits of this transaction.  Should 
we have a Govt Affairs person at the meeting to pick up the "politics" of the 
message?  Just a thought.

3. No one really wants to hire any outside PR support.  Everyone was 
comfortable with Peggy and her team taking the lead.  Don't want to appear 
that Enron is "selling" the deal.  The deal is good and we should let it 
speak for itself.  Does everyone agree?

4. We are looking for a consultant  to support us on MWBE issues.  This 
should be done (at least contracted) by June 1.

5. What have we told outside political support about this deal (eg, Piper, 
Marbury)?  Sue Landwehr and Roy we need to make sure that you have some time 
the week of June 5 to cover any political issues that may arise.  Can we 
coordinate our schedules?

Thanks,

Jim

I just had the opportunity to review a report issued by the ICC assessing 
retail and wholesale competition in Illinois.  If you would like a hard copy, 
let me know.  Salient facts/ conclusions are as follows:

1.  Switching rates are high in Com Ed territory only.  By end of 2000, 22% 
of eligible customers had switched, representing 62% of usage. Larger usage 
customers are switching with greater frequency than smaller usage customers.  
Approximately 40% of delivery service customers were using the PPO.  Approx. 
8 marketers are active in Com Ed with only 3or 4 acquiring significant 
numbers of customers.

2.  ICC believes retail prices may increase dramatically in 2005 by the time 
the general rate freeze expires.

3.  ICC is concerned about wholesale competition noting that utilization of 
the PPO evidences little physical delivery by suppliers.  ICC is also 
concerned about the ability of the Illinois transmission system to support a 
competitive wholesale market within and between utilities.  The number of 
TLR's attained record levels last years and there are concerns about managing 
load pockets.  If the situation remains unchanged, retail prices will be 
higher than they would have been had the market structure supported wholesale 
competition.

4.  Non-Coincident Peak demand in Illinois in 1999 was 29,561Mw and 28,040MW 
in 2000, however overall growth in demand is 1.4%.

5. The most successful suppliers are either Illinois utilities or affiliates 
of Illinois gas and electric utilities, raising market power concerns.

6.  ICC is investigating the capacity of the Illinois utilities' transmission 
and distribution systems.  As part of the study, the ICC will be developing a 
comprehensive computer simulation model of the regional transmission grid to 
identify problem spots on the grid including potential load pockets as well 
as inter-utility constraints that may limit wholesale deliveries during 
critical peak hours.  This will assist in state and federal proceedings.

7.  The ICC is concerned about the market power exercised by utilities and 
has been collecting data  on each utility's interconnection and transmission 
queues to watch for signs of favoritism directed towards their affiliates  or 
any other violations of FERC Order 888.

Hope this is useful.

Eric and Tim -- I spoke with IP last week (Kathy Patton and Joe 
Lakshmanan)and their position is that the word "parallel" in the Terms and 
Conditions refers to load, not generation, thus if any load is capable of 
being served by either self-gen or utility resources, standby charges will be 
imposed -- retroactively, and for five years.  I left the discussion with a 
commitment that Enron would look into how the load was configured.  The 
attached draft letter solicits that, and other, info from ISU.  I think that 
we have to consider that ISU's ability to run its self-gen units without 
paying standby charges was a courtesy IP would only extend to the customer, 
not Enron.  It is not believebale that only now IP learned how the University 
uses its self-gen units -- this was probably a "wink-and-nod" arrangement 
between the two before Enron came into the picture.  
 This raises some possibilities: 1) ISU pays for any standby charges related 
to the units' use;  2) ISU reconfigures,at its cost, each unit so that each 
one is the sole source for the respective load being served; or, 3) there was 
a mutual mistake between Enron and ISU regarding the use of the units in 
question that is so fundamental to the deal that it needs to be unwound.  
This is a dispute for which ISU was at risk regardless of which non-utility 
entity was providing commodity service.
 In any event, I have attached a draft letter to the University that, after 
necessary changes, I believe should go out over you signature TIm.  Please 
look it over at your earliest convenience and let me know what steps you 
would like me to take next.  Thanks.

Rick -- This is a string of e-mails regarding the ISU/Illinois Power issue.  
We did confirm by onsite inspection that the units in question are 
electrically isolated from the utility and therefore do not require standby 
service as mandated by IP.

Tim ... this email is to confirm our conversation from earlier this evening.

Before the SC 21 agreement is executed/sent to Illinois Power Co., the 
proposal to raise the issue of ISU's right of ability to use backup 
generators before the Illinois Commerce Commission should be reviewed with 
the (EES) Office of the Chairman.  

Although this will delay the process, we need to make sure we do not conflict 
with any initiatives, or other efforts of which we may not be aware.  

If you have any questions, pls page me at 888-948-5919.

Thanks.

I agree with Roy.  Please pull the trigger on your recommendation.  

An estimate of the avoided charges is $30,000 per month ($12/kW demand charge 
*  2,500 kW generator).

Roy and Tim ... if we decide to go to the ICC,  need to brief my mgmt on the 
following:

Potential impact on our contractual obligations to ISU, given the various 
actions that IP may take (eg: retroactive change of tariif);
Potential financial impact to EES, given the various actions IP may take.

I'll see Bob Hurt on Mon., 6/11 in Houston, and will brief him on the 
situation.

Subject: ISU and IP

Tim and Marc -- I have looked over Conrad Siudyla's May 31, 2001 letter to 
you and have the following comments.  First, he is patently threatening the 
customer and Enron that if the self-gen units are parallel or regularly run 
as peak shavers ( "IP reserves the right to periodically inspect all 
generators at the ISU campus to ensure that they are electrically isolated 
and that they are not being used on a regular basis for peak shaving") 
standby service is required and will be applied retroactively to the 
contract.  Clearly IP intends to back bill Enron once ISU operates its peak 
shaving plants and impose a huge charge on us.  It is imperative that we have 
our rights straight: 
 First, that the peak shavers are isolated and not parallel;
 Second, that we are comfortable with having to enforce our rights at the 
ICC; and
 Third, that the customer has an unfettered right to operate its self-gen 
units as peak shavers.

 Therefore I propose that we obtain written veification from the customer 
that the units are truly isolated. The customer will need to run its units to 
peak shave in at least August so the threat expressed that such use will 
trigger a retroactive back bill should be taken seriously.
 The anticompetitive situation described above needs to be raised at the 
Commission now.  We need to ensure that the ICC will enforce IP's tariffs in 
a manner consistent with our interpretation of the customer's (and hence 
Enron's as agent) rights under the tariffs.

Enron's Negotiation Position:

As a result of the meeting, the following consensus was reached as to our 
negotiating position with Com Ed:

1.   Negotiate with Com Ed to get what we need in order to do physical deals 
in its service territory.  That translates into negotiating a modified FRP 
agreement.  (The FRP was a one year deal that some marketers signed up for in 
which Com Ed scheduled all the capacity and energy and marketers arranged 
transmission and ancilliaries).  In essence, we want a call option on 
ancilliaries of our choice to cover 2000 MW of power at a price that keeps us 
whole with our existing book of business.  (2000 MW is a negotiable amount 
that represents approximately 10% of Com Ed's peak load).  This would cover 
our existing position (approximately 5 million mwh) as well as allow us to 
grow our business.  The 2000 MW call option would not necessarily be tied to 
existing retail load, leaving us with more flexibility and options.

2.  Under Com Ed's proposal, the PPO would end in 2004, but could end earlier 
for certain large customers paying zero CTC.  In that event, the PPO should 
be replaced with a real time day ahead price into Cinergy.  For Enron's 
customers affected by losing the PPO, we would have the modified FRP 
agreement with the option to put our customers on the bundled rate.  For  
customers who lose the PPO option in the 2002 and 2004 timeframe because of 
the zero CTC, they would not be at risk for having the CTC reinstated.  In 
other words, once the utility moves customers off the PPO, Com ED loses the 
right to come back in and reinstate the CTC for those customers.

Next Steps

1.  Mark Ulrich is reviewing a comparison between the curves, the OATT and 
the the FRP to determine the ancilliary service charge we would be willing to 
pay.

2.  Rogers Herndon is reviewing the Com Ed tariffs on balancing etc.

3.  Once these action items are completed and incorporated into our 
negotiation position, I will call Frank Clark to arrange a meeting.

Barbara and I had the opportunity to meet with FERC Commissioner Brownell, =
who was in Columbus today to speak at the Ohio Energy Summit.

Her presentation stressed the sea change at FERC and called for aggressive =
cooperation of all stakeholders to develop a common market design and inter=
connection procedures for all RTOs.  Barbara and I were able to meet her af=
ter her presentation for a half hour or so, during which time she stated th=
at the common tariff she anticipated coming out of the RTO related discussi=
ons at FERC would likely prompt many lawsuits filed by the incumbent utilit=
ies.  She urged, of course, that Enron be represented during the FERC RTO W=
eek discussions, which will be sharply focused on technical market structur=
e issues rather than governance.

We had the opportunity to discuss several Ohio-specific concerns, including=
 the current complaints before the Ohio Commission regarding the incumbents=
' disregard of their agreements to serve all load under the same terms and =
conditions of the OATT.  She took note of our points regarding the impact o=
f differential imbalance protocols and OASIS information posting, and sugge=
sted the upcoming RTO discussions would present the opportunity to discuss =
those and other issues generically.  She also commended Ohio Chariman Schri=
ber for the interest he has expressed to her and to the Ohio congressional =
delegation in resolving wholesale electricity market issues.  It was announ=
ced at the Summit by Governor Taft that Schriber will head a Federal Energy=
 Policy Group to promote the establishment of  wholesale markets that suppo=
rt a robust retail choice program for Ohio.  Details on the formation of th=
e group are not yet public, but we are taking steps to assure that we are r=
epresented in the Group.

Please see the summary below.  Of note is Chairman Scriber's comment that he 
is going to raise the shopping credit for the southern utilities - I think 
this increases are leverage going in to meetings with AEP.  I would also 
recommend that we move on Cinergy and strike while the iron is hot.  On the 
other hand, if we hold off, we could get higher shopping credits.  However, 
the utilities will argue to recover the amount of the increase through the 
Regulatory Asset Charge.  Although the stipulations in the cases, to the best 
of my recollection, do not provide for this, my sense is that they would 
recover the cost.  

Schriber's comments on POLR are also interesting in light of the statute that 
requires competitive bidding at the end of the Market Development Period.  I 
think this summer would be a good time to meet with Schriber to discuss our 
views on the POLR issue and would welcome feedback from any of you as to what 
we want to say.  My inclination for starters is to require separate bids by 
utility by customer class so that we do not have to mix residential with 
commercial.  Also I would argue that that the winning bidder automatically 
become the POLR and that the utility not be in a position to usurp this role 
by matching the winning bidder's price.  Other thoughts on how the POLR rate 
should be structured, i.e. is it based on a market index plus or a fixed 
price, need to be discussed in terms of how you compare bids.

Also please note the comments on transmission.

		 Subject: Schriber 5/23 testiimony

Chairman Schriber testified to the House Public Utilities Committee on May 
23.  After a very brief overview of his history with SB 3, he focused on the 
fact "not much progress had been made" in the southern half of Ohio, where 
customer switching rates were low.  He stated that inducing shopping will be 
a major effort of the Commission this coming year (although he acknowledged 
that the effort was like"pushing on a string"), and he expressly stated that 
the Commission will order higher shopping credits next year.  Several staff 
members I spoke to in the afternoon were surprised he had spoken definitively 
on that issue.  He also highlighted the MSG controversy before the 
Commission, stating that it was a "no win situation for the PUCO".  

Predictably, he commented on the differences between California and Ohio, 
pointing out there had been no divestiture in Ohio, contrasting bilateral 
contracts with the Cal PX, noting that California limited purchasing to the 
day ahead and spot markets, and claiming that our transmission system was 
more robust.  Despite these assurances, he expressed a concern over the 
potential situation at the end of the transition period(s), when wholesale 
prices could still be higher than the current capped rate.  The PUCO, he 
claimed, is thinking hard over who will be the provider of last resort, and 
at what price; and stated that there will be a need for the POLR to manage 
their risk by entering into long term arrangements for procuring power.  

Schriber stated that the potential for problems when the market development 
period ends may be mitigated by the size of the market and the state of the 
transmission system, and asserted the need to push FERC on these issues.  He 
expressed comfort about the new generating capacity coming on line in Ohio -- 
2200 MW having been added since 1999.   At the same time he was cautious 
about the fact that this was gas fired generation.

On the subject of natural gas, Schriber noted that forward prices for gas had 
fallen to the $4.50/$5.00 for next winter.  He stated that the PUO is 
contemplating a limited pilot program for next year that would provide 
opportunities for utilities to hedge their purchases.

Several legislators asked questions at the end of the presentation.  The 
concerns reflected were:

1. Commission management of the POLR's market price after the end of the 
market development.  Alan had no specific answer, other than the fact the 
PUCO was thinking about this issue.

2. Federal plan to utilize eminent domain to bolster the electric 
transmission system.  Alan responded by noting Ohio's strong transmission 
siting authority, which he believed was preferable to federal exercise of 
authority.  On the other hand he noted that some states like Indiana don't 
have a strong state siting law, and in those cases federal exercise of 
jurisdiction may be necessary.  He said that if the federal government 
exercises authority in the manner that Ohio does, that would be appropriate.

3.  Representative Sites was concerned about the sapping of "our" power 
supplies by other states, and asked what we could do to prevent it.  Alan 
responded that we cannot embargo "our" generating facilities.

4.  Representative Driehaus asked whether the reluctance of CG&E customers to 
switch was a result of what happened in the gas market in Cincinnati.  
Schriber responded by saying that, unlike the gas situation, competitive 
electricity providers were required to be certified by the PUCO.

Thanks Kerry.  I have already had preliminary discussions with Dominion/East 
Ohio and NiSource/Columbia; however, I think your idea to get a meeting 
Schriber is excellent. I would like to get all the Ohio utilities freed-up to 
look at hedging programs so that ENA can provide risk management services.

Keep me posted and let me know if I can do anything for you.

		 Subject: gas hedging pilot program in Ohio

On Wednesday, Ohio PUCO Chairman Alan Schriber revealed in testimony to the 
House Public Utilities Committee that the Commission is considering putting 
in place a pilot program for the coming heating season in which gas utilities 
could hedge gas cost exposure.  Subsequently I learned from the PUCO staff 
that Schriber had met with them the day before, at which time staff  
advocated that hedging be facilitated.  I also learned that staff has been in 
discussions with East Ohio Gas/Dominion on the same subject, and that this 
was the impetus for staff's discussion with Schreiber.

Although the Commission has taken no formal action at this point, staff 
contacts advise that something will likely take shape over the next several 
weeks, and conceivably that other gas utilities may be involved.  In the 
meantime, it may be expedient to meet with Chairman Schriber to position 
ourselves to take advantage of this opportunity -- by advocating a broad 
extension of the program to other gas utilities as well as program-specific 
features, e.g. leveraging our weather derivative products.  If there is 
interest, I would be happy to arrange a meeting with him.  And, given 
Dominion's interest, we may wish to be in contact East Ohio Gas.

Jeff,

You requested that I look into the impact of AEP's proposed transmission price increase on the shopping credit in Ohio.  Yesterday, I met with AEP to discuss this issue and the short answer is that the shopping credit currently covers both the generation and the transmission rates.  Once a new transmission rate is approved, AEP plans to file at the PUCO to adjust the transmission and distribution rates and increase the shopping credit.  (Recall the distribution is determined by subtracting from the sum of T and D, the FERC approved T).  So this is good news and we should be fine - except of course to check their numbers and concur with what they ultimately file at PUCO.  Conceptually, however, we are on the same page. 

Detailed Discussion

The implementation case settlement includes shopping credits for generation only that are broken down based on rate class averages.  Obviously, the load factor for each customer will affect the actual price.  Post-settlement, AEP decided that it made more sense to bill the marketers for transmission, since the marketers would be doing the scheduling.  Thus, AEP added a transmission component to the shopping credit.  According to AEP, embedded in the generation component is generation, balancing and line losses.  The transmission component includes transmission plus all the other ancilliaries.  (Ex. AC-9 of AEP's filing which I will fax to Jeff and anyone else who requests it, details the current and proposed rates for each ancilliary service).  

According to AEP, the difference between the Price to Compare on their literature and the Generation Price to Compare in the settlement is the transmission price.  Using their sample information, that translates into a transmission price of approximately $5.00/MWH for GS-2 customers.  Enron calculated an average transmission price of $6.38/MWH which was based on a system-average load ratio share.  AEP indicated that the Load Ratio Share for CSP and OP is 12.45 and 18.59 respectively.  

Further, in our calculation, we assumed a 30% load factor based on a specific customer's characteristics, however AEP claims that the load factor for their total system is between 64 and 68% which will also impact the calculation.

The following hypothetical explains how the charges are unbundled:

Assume a GS-2 customer with a demand charge of $3.00/kw and energy charge of $.04/kwh and a customer charge of $20/month:


Function                  Demand               Energy                      Customer Charge

Distribution                    $2.00                     0                               $20.00
Transmission                 $1.00                 $.005/kwh                              0
Generation                           0                 $.035/kwh                              0


Under this scenario, a customer with a 15% load factor pays approximately 10.5 cents/kwh for transmission plus 3.5 for generation for a price to beat of $.14, whereas a customer with a 30% load factor pays approximately 5.5cents/kwh plus 3.5 for generation for a price to beat of $.09.

AEP also indicated that the price of transmission ($1.42/kw currently and  $1.95/kw proposed is for basic network transmission into AEP at the below 40kv level.

I hope this helps.  If you need more info, let me know and if needed, I can arrange for you to talk with AEP directly.

Janine

p.s. Could someone forward this to Nicole Schwartz.  She is not receiving emails from folks on outlook.  Thanks.

 concern that lifting the PPO early without the presence of a competitive m=
arket could create a California-like situation - which is what they were st=
riving to avoid - because their approach would leave buyers on the competit=
ive market without having any sellers due to problems with physical deliver=
y.  We indicated our concern for our existing customers and our ability to =
grow our business in Illinois.  We stressed the PJM model as a workable sol=
ution that creates a liquid market.  There was much enthusiasm on the part =
of ComEd for focusing ICC attention on creating that kind of a solution for=
 Illinois.  Arlene Juracek encouraged us to work with them on this and to m=
eet with Steve Nauman and Celia David.  Since Mike Roan and I will be in Il=
linois on this Tuesday and Wednesday, first to hear the Alliance's presenta=
tion to the ICC and then for Mike to make a presentation the following day,=
 we are going to try and meet with them.

One of our objectives was to set up a team between Enron and ComEd to go th=
rough the requirements and nuts and bolts of physical delivery into Illinoi=
s.  This was accomplished and Jeff Merola and Mark Ulrich witll be meeting =
 with Ann McGlin at ComEd to get a better understanding of what we can and =
cannot do to achieve physical delivery.  Also, Michael Freeman indicated a =
willingness to sell us a structured retail product to help us achieve physi=
cal delivery (energy and/or load following services), and made it clear tha=
t whatever deal we do with the Exelon Power team would be independent and s=
eparate from any deal we might do with ComEd on the PPO front.  Once we hav=
e completed our discussions with Ann McGlin and with Michael Freeman, we wi=
ll meet again with ComEd to negotiate what we need for physical delivery. =
=20

We also discussed other aspects of the ComEd letter to the ICC and received=
 the following clarifications.  Customers going off the PPO before 2004 wou=
ld be offered rate 6L which is a bundled rate.  After 2004, ComEd plans to =
go to real time pricing on a day ahead or hourly basis.  As to whether the =
CTC could be reinstated after a customer was dropped from PPO, they indicat=
ed that they had not thought about it, but believed the law would allow thi=
s.  Arlene Juracek, however, commented that they could lock in a CTC agreem=
ent with a customer.  I interpret that to mean that as part of an agreement=
 to support ComEd in its proposal, we may be able to guarantee that for our=
 customers, the CTC will not reemerge if market prices go down or that we c=
an negotiate a limited CTC, etc. =20

We also pointed out that we had other concerns like ComEd's unwillingness t=
o negotiate the Supplier Agreement.  Not much time was spent on that but my=
 sense is that if this is an obstacle to getting our concurrence, we may be=
 able to work through this as well.

Frank Clark asked us about our willingness to take on the role of supplier =
of last resort and we responded that we needed first to be sure that we cou=
ld physically deliver to customers.  Once that hurdle is addressed, we woul=
d be willing to consider that possibility.

The ComEd negotiating team will meet in Houston on either the morning of Ju=
ly 16th or 17th when we believe the tasks with ComEd will be completed, in =
order to evaluate what we have learned and what our next steps should be.  =
I will then arrange a follow-up meeting with Pam Strobel and her team. =20

Rick, 
Barbara and Kerry are traveling to Missouri tommorrow to negotiate with 
Ameren.  This bill which will be an industrial buy-through only (due to 
complications with Constitutional Amendments in Missouri involving a 
requirement for a referendum for any tax law changes).   The bill applies to 
industrials greater than 1 MW in Ameren and 2 MW everywhere else.  In 
speaking to EES, they want us to try and get the threshold reduced to 500kw 
to 1mw.  ENA wants load following in order to sell blocks of power to large 
industrials.  In addition, there are a host of other issues, including, 
insufficient regulatory review for shifting generation into a genco, no code 
of conduct for that genco and Illinois-styled stranded cost recovery.  Kerry 
and Barbara have a tough assignment to get anything here.  We thought it 
would be best to see how these negotiations go before formulating what kind 
of message we would like Ken Lay to deliver if he is willing.  To make 
matters worse, the industrial group has already caved on the bill.  Kerry and 
Barbara, I believe are also meeting with the consumer advocates office and 
the Commission staff who have not signed off on the bill.  We should know 
more in the next day or two.  Nothing will happen at the legislature until 
next week.

Subject: Missouri Legislation and Request for Assistance from Ken Lay


FROM: BARBARA HUETER
 KERRY STROUP


The Missouri Senate Commerce and Environment Committee is expected to pass 
Sub.SB455 when it returns from spring break during the week of March 26th or 
the following week.  Senate President Pro Tem Peter Kinder introduced the 
bill for AmerenUE.  AmerenUE is controlling the process. We must go through 
Ameren for changes - and they are not very willing to concede.  

We would like to arrange for Ken Lay to call Senator Kinder to express 
Enron's concerns about the bill (market structure, lack of benefits for 
customers).  Our local lobbyist, Roy Cagle, could let Senator Kinder know 
that Ken Lay would like to speak with him and arrange an appropriate time for 
the call to take place.  It would be most helpful if the call could take 
place by March 26th.

Senator Kinder graduated from the U of Missouri-Columbia in the 1970's.  He 
was a member of the same fraternity as Ken Lay.  Peter also met Ken at the 
Republican Convention last summer -- and seemed very excited about it.  Also, 
being a Republican, Peter seems very impressed by Ken Lay's relationship with 
the President.  We think this is a good opportunity for Enron to gain some 
leverage over Ameren via Senator Kinder.

Kerry and I are analyzing the various drafts and suggestions for changes to 
the bill.  We are working with numerous other stakeholders  -- so the actual 
contents of the deal/bill are in constant flux.  We would prepare a briefing 
for Mr. Lay but would wish to do so closer to the time of the call so that 
Mr. Lay will have the  most up-to-date information.

In a nutshell -- the bill allows a utility to spin off generation assets to a 
genco at historic net book value.  The utility would then sign a PPA with the 
genco to provide for the full requirements of its captive customers as well 
as eligible customers who have not chosen an alternative supplier.  Customers 
over 1MW in Ameren's service territory and those over 2MW in other service 
territories (munis and coops excluded) would be able to arrange buy-through 
type arrangements with registered suppliers. The bill does not contain 
adequate transmission access language, a code of conduct, appropriate 
unbundling language nor does it address a host of other market structure 
issues that are key to developing robust competition.

Guy,

One of the key questions is whether this transmission rate increase will be applied uniformly to all customers.  Over the weekend, I will take a closer look at the statutes, but preliminarily it appears that it is a grey area but that there would be room to argue that the ICC has no authority to limit FERC rates and so the increase would have to be passed through to all customers.  Should we succeed in this outcome, it would put us on an even playing field for new deals, but it would not help our existing book.

Since the filing was recently made, we have some time till FERC decides.  As I indicated in my last email, Donna Fulton is tracking down the procedural timeframe, so I will let you all know.

As to the filing at FERC, this is as a result of ComEd joining the Alliance RTO.  We have not yet had an opportunity to examine the justification for the increase or to develop a response and will do so if we decide to look into getting in the case.  A decision to get in would be based on the impact on our current book, the impact on new business and the likelihood of success should we decide to participate more actively.  So at this point, we are in the information gathering stage in order to decide what to do.  

Let me know when you have all calculated the potential impact on our book of business.

Thanks.

Janine

Janine:

Can you make sure that this increase will really only impact unbundled customers.  Since transmission prices are regulated by FERC I would think that all customers, bundled or unbundled, would be subject to any increase.

Also, can you give a time when FERC is due to rule on this issue and how long it will be, if ComEd's proposed impact passes, before transmission rates might be affected.

I would also like to know how ComEd is justifying this increase and what Enron's counter position and arguments are.

Thanks,

Guy

Subject:	ComEd Transmission Rate Increase

ComEd has filed to increase its revenue requirements from $170 mil. to $340 which will have an adverse impact on EES's book of business.  From an EPMI standpoint, they are somewhat indifferent to the increase as long as all entities are treated the same and pay the same price.  

Guy Sharfman is going to analyse the impact on our books to determine our business interest.
Donna Fulton is going to check into the time frame for the proceeding at FERC.  We have already filed an intervention.

The problem in Illinois is that we may face the same problem on transmission that we face with distribution where unbundled customers could pay more for these services than bundled customers.  Thus, in addition to being concerned about our current book, this could adversely affect our ability to attract customers with our new product.  While we do not take on the transmission risk, we still would not be competitive if our transmission rate is higher than what a bundled customer faces. 

Will keep you posted to discuss decisions and strategy once the fact gathering is completed.

Janine

Eric and Tim -- I spoke with IP last week (Kathy Patton and Joe Lakshmanan)and their position is that the word "parallel" in the Terms and Conditions refers to load, not generation, thus if any load is capable of being served by either self-gen or utility resources, standby charges will be imposed -- retroactively, and for five years.  I left the discussion with a commitment that Enron would look into how the load was configured.  The attached draft letter solicits that, and other, info from ISU.  I think that we have to consider that ISU's ability to run its self-gen units without paying standby charges was a courtesy IP would only extend to the customer, not Enron.  It is not believebale that only now IP learned how the University uses its self-gen units -- this was probably a "wink-and-nod" arrangement between the two before Enron came into the picture.  
	This raises some possibilities: 1) ISU pays for any standby charges related to the units' use;  2) ISU reconfigures,at its cost, each unit so that each one is the sole source for the respective load being served; or, 3) there was a mutual mistake between Enron and ISU regarding the use of the units in question that is so fundamental to the deal that it needs to be unwound.  This is a dispute for which ISU was at risk regardless of which non-utility entity was providing commodity service.
	In any event, I have attached a draft letter to the University that, after necessary changes, I believe should go out over you signature TIm.  Please look it over at your earliest convenience and let me know what steps you would like me to take next.  Thanks.

FYI - As you may have heard, ComEd has filed to raise T&D rates about 37% (about $5.5/MWh).  If they are granted the full increase in rates, our existing position will undoubtedly take a hit.  There are 3 potential but independent effects on our book...

Primary Effect - Assuming all customers have zero CTC, if T&D rates go up $5.5/MWh on average and we have 8.5million MWh so -$47m hit to the book.  However, we do have customers with positive CTCs that should offset some of this increase and true impact would likely be around -$12m. Remember this assumes ComEd get's the full $5.5/MWh increase they're asking for. 

Secondary Effect - Assume we still cannot deliver physically in IL.  With higher distribution rates customers are now more likely to get kicked off PPO (bc CTC=0) and we're returning them to bundled rates (Illinois State Univ. problem).  The impact would be about -$21m  [($71 - $76)/MWh * 4.2m MWh = -$21] if everyone's returned to BBR and we do not deliver.  The formula above is [(Avg price Customers are paying us - Avg BBR price)*(MWhs for 2005-2010)].

Tertiary Effect - We figure setup a desk to physically deliver and our delivery service rates are now higher.  We're back to the Primary effect.  However, if we can beat the generation prices embedded in PPO we're likely to offset that -$12m.

These are not additive effects and should not be summed.  They are worst-case scenarios under various states of the world.  Also they are rough estimates.  Finally, remember that no book impacts will be made until we understand which states of the will take place after the final order in April 2002.

I'm working closely with Janine Migden, Roy Boston, Guy Sharfman, and Harry Kingerski to identify which areas Enron will address in the rate case.  

Please do not share this information freely.  We are trying to negotiate with ComEd for wholesale energy and services and this information could tremendously hurt our negotiating position.

Please feel free to ask me questions on anything.

Hello All -- Just and update on the Chicago Deal.  
 The ordinance which would permit the City to enter into a multi-year 
agreement was introduced in the City Council yesterday and the Mayor held a 
post-Council press conference with our deal being the first issue addressed 
(and the only one to have a nice graphic showing its benefits).  Several 
high-profile issues were also on the agenda (racial profiling, redistricting, 
legal representations for aldermen re: school locations, school board CEO 
Paul Vallas' future, Gery Chico's replacement, etc.) so the press spent 
several minutes questioning both the Mayor and City Commissioner Bill Abolt 
on our issue.  Abolt did a masterful job of handling the issue with his point 
being that the City has lived up to its commitment to 1) develop a 
competitive market, 2) reduce costs while, 3) promoting green power 
(renewables).  The press focused on whether ComEd was resentful that 60% of 
the City's requirements will be covered by this agreement to which Mr. Dwyer, 
of ComEd, after the press conference stated that they viewed the deal as a 
win because ComEd got the green component of the City's business.  Peggy 
Mahoney also made a post conference statement and was welcomed by the press 
and was given a favorable treatment by the press (Dick Kay, Andy Shaw and 
Mike Flannery).  
 On balance, I think that the press did not know what to make of this deal 
but knew that this is an appropriate response to the drubbing the Mayor has 
received in the past for putting all of the City's energy needs in one basket 
laid at the feet of ComEd.  As you know, this is only the introduction of our 
deal to the City Council and it has not been approved yet.  We expect that 
that will occur either later in June or certainly by the end of July.  The 
actual contract will be finalized and signed at that time.  In the mean time, 
I expect that the press will have more questions as this matter moves forward 
and it goes to the Council's Energy Committee.  The City is doing the heavy 
lifting and it is best that Enron not take an over large profile -- but we 
also cannot become invisible either.  Julie Starsiak of Ronan & Potts and 
Peggy Mahoney are very much involved.

Rick -- This is a string of e-mails regarding the ISU/Illinois Power issue.  We did confirm by onsite inspection that the units in question are electrically isolated from the utility and therefore do not require standby service as mandated by IP.

In my original letter to ISU attached to the contract they were directed to return the signed contract to my attention.  In addition, as a follow up to our telephone conversation I have sent a Email restating that the signed SC21 contract needs to come back to my office.  I will also place a call to Sheila Taylor to make sure that ISU returns the executed document to Enron and not IP.

Tim ... this email is to confirm our conversation from earlier this evening.

Before the SC 21 agreement is executed/sent to Illinois Power Co., the proposal to raise the issue of ISU's right of ability to use backup generators before the Illinois Commerce Commission should be reviewed with the (EES) Office of the Chairman.  

Although this will delay the process, we need to make sure we do not conflict with any initiatives, or other efforts of which we may not be aware.  

If you have any questions, pls page me at 888-948-5919.

Thanks.

I agree with Roy.  Please pull the trigger on your recommendation.  

An estimate of the avoided charges is $30,000 per month ($12/kW demand charge *  2,500 kW generator).

Potential impact on our contractual obligations to ISU, given the various actions that IP may take (eg: retroactive change of tariif);
Potential financial impact to EES, given the various actions IP may take.

I'll see Bob Hurt on Mon., 6/11 in Houston, and will brief him on the situation.

Subject:	ISU and IP

Tim and Marc -- I have looked over Conrad Siudyla's May 31, 2001 letter to you and have the following comments.  First, he is patently threatening the customer and Enron that if the self-gen units are parallel or regularly run as peak shavers ( "IP reserves the right to periodically inspect all generators at the ISU campus to ensure that they are electrically isolated and that they are not being used on a regular basis for peak shaving") standby service is required and will be applied retroactively to the contract.  Clearly IP intends to back bill Enron once ISU operates its peak shaving plants and impose a huge charge on us.  It is imperative that we have our rights straight: 
	First, that the peak shavers are isolated and not parallel;
	Second, that we are comfortable with having to enforce our rights at the ICC; and
	Third, that the customer has an unfettered right to operate its self-gen units as peak shavers.

	Therefore I propose that we obtain written veification from the customer that the units are truly isolated. The customer will need to run its units to peak shave in at least August so the threat expressed that such use will trigger a retroactive back bill should be taken seriously.
	The anticompetitive situation described above needs to be raised at the Commission now.  We need to ensure that the ICC will enforce IP's tariffs in a manner consistent with our interpretation of the customer's (and hence Enron's as agent) rights under the tariffs.

Probably right, but I'm working on it.  We may be able to make an argument for pass thru to all customers which would neutralize the impact on new business and we may be able to do it without a huge effort.

Subject:	RE: ComEd Transmission Rate Increase

Janine:

Can you make sure that this increase will really only impact unbundled customers.  Since transmission prices are regulated by FERC I would think that all customers, bundled or unbundled, would be subject to any increase.

Also, can you give a time when FERC is due to rule on this issue and how long it will be, if ComEd's proposed impact passes, before transmission rates might be affected.

I would also like to know how ComEd is justifying this increase and what Enron's counter position and arguments are.

Thanks,

Guy

Subject:	ComEd Transmission Rate Increase

ComEd has filed to increase its revenue requirements from $170 mil. to $340 which will have an adverse impact on EES's book of business.  From an EPMI standpoint, they are somewhat indifferent to the increase as long as all entities are treated the same and pay the same price.  

Guy Sharfman is going to analyse the impact on our books to determine our business interest.
Donna Fulton is going to check into the time frame for the proceeding at FERC.  We have already filed an intervention.

The problem in Illinois is that we may face the same problem on transmission that we face with distribution where unbundled customers could pay more for these services than bundled customers.  Thus, in addition to being concerned about our current book, this could adversely affect our ability to attract customers with our new product.  While we do not take on the transmission risk, we still would not be competitive if our transmission rate is higher than what a bundled customer faces. 

Will keep you posted to discuss decisions and strategy once the fact gathering is completed.

Janine

Russell -- As we discussed earlier today, I talked with Joel Sharkey, Supervisor of the Michigan PSC staff's Gas Division Competitive Services Section regarding our upcoming gas supply outsourcing meeting with MGU on August 21st.  Joel recommended that we review his testimony in Consumers Energy's case wherein the LDC asked for a change in its gas purchasing practices.  I have attached the full text of his testimony below.  Joel's testimony focused on the reasonableness and prudence of Consumers' filing.  The Commission's final order was issued July 25 and approved a settlement that generally followed his testimony.  Following is a brief synopsis of that testimony.

	--	Consumers' past approach to gas supply purchasing relied on long-term gas supply contracts. In contrast, Consumers' current filing proposes 		to rely instead on shorter-term, market-based contracts.

	--	Joel Sharkey believes that such a gas acquisition practice is imprudent because it focuses only on short-term purchasing strategies and 			exposes ratepayers to highly volatile markets and decreases reliability because of the risk that supply may not be available in the short-term.

	--	Staff recognizes that it is imprudent to lock prices when they are at historically high levels (i.e., $10.00 mcf).

	-- 	Historically, Consumers was the low-cost provider of gas because it used long term fixed price contracts.  Staff does not want this to change.  		Staff believes that marketers' prices will cluster around the GCR factor.

	-- 	Marketers need some type of standard, like the GCR, against which to measure their effectiveness.  Enron bought Columbia's customers 			behind MichCon and offered those customers $ 8.49 mcf commodity; MichCon's reinstated GCR would have been $ 5.17 mcf; Energy 			America was offering customers $ 6.249 mcf with a 5-10% rebate after 3 years; CMS marketing will charge $ 5.35 mcf weather normalized 			gas for two years, etc.

	-- 	Shorter term contracts do not minimize stranded costs.  The LDC already knows what its migration risks and can plan accordingly.

	--	Since: 1) marketers prefer competing against prices that are at market (fluctuating) levels; and, 2)  annual gas costs may not reflect monthly or 		daily prices; and, 3) LDC sales customers may have a negative reaction to an increase in volatility; then 4) the Commission needs to balance 		the competing interests of marketers and customers. 

	--	If Consumers wants to use hedging as part of its gas acquisition strategy, it should include that in its next GCR plan.

	-- 	Consumers asked for an additional $1.00 mcf "volatility component" which was analyzed and rejected by Mr. Sharkey.  Notably, his rejection 		was based on an analysis of  Act 304 and his finding that only two reasons listed in the Act were relevant to Consumers' proposed GCR plan: 		market volatility  and the likelihood of shifting large under recoveries to future GCR years. Consumers' other reasons were inconsistent with the 		purposes of the Act, specifically, the volatility component did not minimize the cost of gas.  

	--	Mr. Sharkey did opine that a $1.00 adder could, under MCL 460.6h(6), be linked to the occurence of a future event as a contingent GCR factor, 		but that was not proposed by Consumers, so the $ 1.00 volatility component was not recommend by staff.

	Additionally, when I spoke to Mr. Sharkey he told me that he is looking forward to meeting with us on the 21st.  I responded that we have what I believe to be a win-win proposal.  He indicated that such a result would be well received by staff because MGU has given them a great deal of trouble and that there were times when staff wanted someone to buy that company so that it could be better run.  Such candor  to an outside party regarding a regulated company is unusual and underscores his hopefulness that we will deliver a product that solves a  problem for the Commission.

On Friday, July 6th, we had an excellent first meeting with Com Ed. 

In attendence from Enron were Rogers Herndon, Marc Ulrich, Jeff Merola, Brad 
Snyder, Guy Sharfman and myself.  (Roy Boston and our attorney Chris Townsend 
attended our pre-meeting discussion but did not attend at ComEd to keep our 
numbers down).

In attendence from Com Ed were Pam Strobel President, Exelon Energy Delivery 
Company and Vice Chair, ComEd; Frank Clark, Ex. V.P. Customer Marketing and 
Energy Delivery Services, ComEd; Gerald Rhodes, President, Exelon Energy; 
Arlene Juracek, Vice President, Regulatory & Strategic Services, ComEd; John 
McCawley, Director, Electric and Gas Choice; and Michael Freeman, Long-Term 
Trader, Exelon Power Team.

During the course of the meeting, we delivered our message that we, like 
ComEd, wanted to see a competitive market emerge in Illinois, but that we had 
concern that lifting the PPO early without the presence of a competitive 
market could create a California-like situation - which is what they were 
striving to avoid - because their approach would leave buyers on the 
competitive market without having any sellers due to problems with physical 
delivery.  We indicated our concern for our existing customers and our 
ability to grow our business in Illinois.  We stressed the PJM model as a 
workable solution that creates a liquid market.  There was much enthusiasm on 
the part of ComEd for focusing ICC attention on creating that kind of a 
solution for Illinois.  Arlene Juracek encouraged us to work with them on 
this and to meet with Steve Nauman and Celia David.  Since Mike Roan and I 
will be in Illinois on this Tuesday and Wednesday, first to hear the 
Alliance's presentation to the ICC and then for Mike to make a presentation 
the following day, we are going to try and meet with them.

One of our objectives was to set up a team between Enron and ComEd to go 
through the requirements and nuts and bolts of physical delivery into 
Illinois.  This was accomplished and Jeff Merola and Mark Ulrich witll be 
meeting  with Ann McGlin at ComEd to get a better understanding of what we 
can and cannot do to achieve physical delivery.  Also, Michael Freeman 
indicated a willingness to sell us a structured retail product to help us 
achieve physical delivery (energy and/or load following services), and made 
it clear that whatever deal we do with the Exelon Power team would be 
independent and separate from any deal we might do with ComEd on the PPO 
front.  Once we have completed our discussions with Ann McGlin and with 
Michael Freeman, we will meet again with ComEd to negotiate what we need for 
physical delivery.  

We also discussed other aspects of the ComEd letter to the ICC and received 
the following clarifications.  Customers going off the PPO before 2004 would 
be offered rate 6L which is a bundled rate.  After 2004, ComEd plans to go to 
real time pricing on a day ahead or hourly basis.  As to whether the CTC 
could be reinstated after a customer was dropped from PPO, they indicated 
that they had not thought about it, but believed the law would allow this.  
Arlene Juracek, however, commented that they could lock in a CTC agreement 
with a customer.  I interpret that to mean that as part of an agreement to 
support ComEd in its proposal, we may be able to guarantee that for our 
customers, the CTC will not reemerge if market prices go down or that we can 
negotiate a limited CTC, etc.  

We also pointed out that we had other concerns like ComEd's unwillingness to 
negotiate the Supplier Agreement.  Not much time was spent on that but my 
sense is that if this is an obstacle to getting our concurrence, we may be 
able to work through this as well.

Frank Clark asked us about our willingness to take on the role of supplier of 
last resort and we responded that we needed first to be sure that we could 
physically deliver to customers.  Once that hurdle is addressed, we would be 
willing to consider that possibility.

The ComEd negotiating team will meet in Houston on either the morning of July 
16th or 17th when we believe the tasks with ComEd will be completed, in order 
to evaluate what we have learned and what our next steps should be.  I will 
then arrange a follow-up meeting with Pam Strobel and her team.

At the conclusion of the meeting on competitive bidding, parties were encouraged to file comments at the PUCO.  Below is a draft that reflects the subjects discussed and where I think we ought to land, based on our meeting earlier this week.  I would like to file these soon, so please get back to me.

In the meeting there was a lot of discussion on the RFP process.  Of course the utilities wanted to be able to draft the RFP, choose the winning bidder, have their affiliates participate in the process and have very scanty PUCO oversight, all of which I fought vigourously.  I was asked however if Enron could provide info on what should and should not be in an RFP.  On the should part, I said we could probably provide some insights, but that the should not category would probably be a "I know it when I see it" call.  Having said that, any input on this question would be appreciated.

Janine

Here's a quick update on the Minnesota energy bill.  

Conference committee met all thru the weekend and this afternoon recommended 
a compromise bill, SF #722.   The final bill should be voted on tonight 
before the legislature adjourns at midnight.  

We won one of two issues we were focused on.  The streamlining of 
transmission survived.  The elimination of certificate of need did not.....it 
got wrapped up in the debate over a 10% renewable portfolio mandate by 2015.  
At the end of the horsetrading, the certifcate of need fell victim to the 
enviros.  Their RPS that they thought they had locked was reduced to setting 
goals of achieving a level of 10% of Minnesota supplies as renewables and 
requiring green pricing to be instituted.  The enviros were then adamant that 
no power plants should be exempted from certificate of need. 

The third issue that we were backing is still alive--it just got transfered 
over to the tax committee.  The language to exempt new power plant personal 
property from taxes is still alive in both the House and the Senate, although 
the language in the Senate is much better. It appears that a tax bill and a 
budget bill will not be agreed to by adjournment, so government will shut 
down June 1 if action isn't taken.  Jesse will call a special session next 
week and they will pass a tax bill before the June 1 date.

Lastly,there are two other provisions that we will benefit from---language on 
joint finance that will allow munis and coops to enter into projects that 
they may have felt they were unable to in the past.  This may create come 
business opportunities for our ENA folks.   The other provision was a  
pleasant surprise that I thought would end up on the cutting floor that 
survived--there will be rulemaking for interconnection standards for 
distributed generation of up to 10 MW.

Based on a series of meetings and discussions with many you, below is an 
outline of the proposed strategy for Com Ed.  I will be meeting with 
Commissioner Harvill and also the Commissioners' assistants on Wednesday to 
deliver our message, so if you have any comments on this, please get back to 
me as soon as possible.  (Com Ed is scheduled to meet with the Commissioners 
on Thursday).

The Facts - Customers currently have three rates to choose from: the fixed 
price bundled rate, the PPO which is a discount off the Fixed price bundled 
rate, or an alternative rate provided by a marketer (ARES).  Most of Enron's 
customers are on the PPO although some are on the bundled rate.  Com Ed sent 
a letter to the ICC in which they propose to replace the PPO with a spot 
market price plus  adder to be effective at the end of 2004.  Com Ed also 
acknowledges that with rising market prices, some of the industrial customers 
are or soon will no longer be paying a CTC.  With the relinquishment of the 
CTC obligation comes Com Ed's obligation to provide the PPO rate.  In 
conversations, Com Ed indicated that they would like to replace the fixed 
bundled price with a performance based rate at the end of 2004.  An internal 
analysis prepared by Mark Ulrich sets forth the negative impact of removing 
the PPO on our current book of business.

Issues of Concern:
 
 * Protection of our current book of business
 * Ability to physically deliver into Com Ed on a competitive basis
 * Potential for Default Service deal
 * Potential to market individual customers on a one-on-one basis

The Plan:

Our public position will be that without the capability to physically deliver 
power into the Com Ed market on a competitive basis, the PPO rate should not 
be lifted since customers are left without reasonable options or protection.

Our negotiated position in order of priority is as follows:

1.  Protect our current book of business.  We should negotiate a rate with 
Com Ed that leaves us whole.  This could include the provision by Com Ed of 
ancilliary services.  There is an FRP tariff rate that has expired but that 
we believe offered ancilliary services at a rate that allowed other marketers 
to physically deliver.  We are in the process of obtaining the tariff to see 
if that would work for us to negotiate from, even though it has expired.  In 
essence we want to negotiate a new PPO rate under which Com Ed continues to 
supply our existing customers or preferably that enables us to physically 
deliver to our customers at the same price as the PPO.  Mark Ulrich and Guy 
Sharfman are going to develop a rate that we can take to Com Ed for our 
entire book of business.

2.  Leverage new business opportunities for EES.  These opportunites include 
acquisition of all or a portion of Com Ed's industrial default customers as 
well as individual customer accounts.  (We believe that Com Ed wants to free 
itself from its obligation to serve industrial customers, so there may be an 
opportunity).   The concept is to fold these new customer acquisitions into 
the same deal negotiated for our current customers, allowing EES to expand 
its customer base and potentially its physical delivery capabilities.  From 
the standpoint of acquiring individual customers, we should advocate a real 
time price plus adder starting in 2003 for customers who roll off the CTC. 

3.  Push for Com Ed support of Enron's positions at the ARTO working level.  
Nothing in our agreements, however, with Com Ed should be contingent on the 
RTO functioning, such that Com Ed can have an out for its obligations to 
Enron under the deal.

Janine.

A conference call with Steffes, Kingerski, Boston, Roan, Lewis and me took 
place to discuss Enron's position on Com Ed.  

Summary - We discussed a  public position of "No PPO without an RTO"  since 
without a functioning market, Enron is at risk with our current book of 
business.  From a public policy standpoint, we would argue that without the 
protection of the PPO, customers need a functioning market in which to 
procure power.

Privately, in exchange for supporting the Com Ed Proposal, we would negotiate 
for the following (in order of importance):
1. No losses on our existing book of business by negotiating a bulk power 
deal to cover our exposure.  
2.  Build a broad market by seeking changes to Com Ed FERC tariffs as it 
regards balancing and penalties, etc.

As a separate matter or in conjunction with the above, do a default service  
or some other related deal.  A meeting is scheduled for Friday with Chuck 
Decker to talk through the issues related to physical delivery into Com Ed.  

A more detailed memo will follow this weekend.

Janine --

The point about load balancing and following is critical.  EES is struggling 
to compete with a physical product in ILL.

I know that Don Black and Jay Lewis are trying to figure out what are the 
critical components of the real-time balancing rules.

Maybe we should try and set up a phone call between Govt Affairs and EES Risk 
Mgmt to define the necessary rules and see how (a) a ComEd / ICC Settlement 
would work and (b) what are the implications of the Order 2000 RTO process in 
the Midwest (MISO and ARTO).

Thanks,

Jim

Subject: Com Ed

Last week, Sue and I, along with Phil O'Connor of New Energy met with Frank 
Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek 
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and 
Harvill.

Information Gleaned From the Meeting:

1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the 
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not 
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not 
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO 
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to 
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com 
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on 
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has 
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential, 
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with 
some leverage.

At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum 
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal 
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the 
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its 
default customer service obligations.

Possible Deal Opportunities:

1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive 
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's 
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to 
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the 
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service 
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program 
like municipal aggregation or some other format.

Next Steps:

1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of 
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push 
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue 
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
 a.  Default deal for industrial customers
 b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
 c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR

I bring this Minnesota bill to your attention thinking that it may be one  
state that we can point to as moving forward rather than backward as a 
response to California.  This bill would absolutely not have moved if 
California had not been on the radar screen--for the first time in four 
years, the leadership insisted that the caucuses move something out of 
committee on energy.

WHile customer choice did not ultimately survive (it got knocked out towards 
the end of the committee votes), there was a general agreement by committee 
members that MN had to prepare for retail access, but that they needed to get 
the wholesale market in better shape in preparation.

By the way, the enviromental community was very very confident that they were 
going to get a mandate for a 10% renewable portfolio standard by 2015, and 
they were then going to make Minnesota the poster child to promote mandated 
RPS across the country.  Their mandate turned into "goals" to be met by 
utilities, and they are not happy.

		 Subject: Minnesota Energy Legislation

Earlier this week the Minnesota legislature passed an omnibus energy bill--SF 
#722.  The Governor is expected to sign the bill.  Much of the bill focused 
on increasing conservation, helping low income customers, setting goals for 
renewable energy development, setting up reliability standards (the unions 
had to get something!) etc.  However, there are also some sections that may 
be commercially beneficial to us.

The bill streamlines the process for transmission siting, and to a small 
degree, makes generation siting a bit easier.  Interconnection standards and 
rules for distributed generation (defined as up to 10MW) are required and the 
process will begin late this summer.  The munis and coops had a section on 
"joint finance" that will allow them to enter into projects with other 
parties--this should make it easier for them to do business with us.  
Minnesota has approx 120 municipal utilities and over 40 co ops. 

There is still outstanding an issue of a personal property tax exemption for 
merchant plants.  That provision was transfered to the overall tax bill, 
which is still being debated.  We should have a conclusion on the tax bill 
late next week. 

Please call if you have any questions or would like further info.

We have just learned that AEP is agreeing to construct the Dumont Substation 
in Northern Indiana (which we argued for in the Michigan transmission case): 
however, much of the capacity made available has been reserved with rollover 
rights:

1.  Duke has purchased 416mw beginning the summer of 2002.  It is to provide 
transmission from two Duke merchant plants into MECS (we think to serve a 
utility).

2. Exelon has purchased 500MW for transmission into Com Ed (east to west) for 
2001-2002 under a special tariff arrangement which results in alternative 
higher pricing.

For those following the Michigan case, Kerry will be drafting our brief in 
which we will argue that to extent the transmission capacity is not being 
used to serve competitive retail load, this should not count towards the 
2000mw of increased capacity as required by the dereg statute.

For those covering Com Ed, this bolsters the info we have received regarding 
Com Ed's concern about having adequate capacity.

Last week, Sue and I, along with Phil O'Connor of New Energy met with Frank 
Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek 
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and 
Harvill.

Information Gleaned From the Meeting:

1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the 
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not 
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not 
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO 
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to 
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com 
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on 
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has 
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential, 
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with 
some leverage.

At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum 
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal 
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the 
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its 
default customer service obligations.

Possible Deal Opportunities:

1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive 
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's 
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to 
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the 
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service 
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program 
like municipal aggregation or some other format.

Next Steps:

1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of 
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push 
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue 
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
 a.  Default deal for industrial customers
 b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
 c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR

FYI,  I am attaching for your information the price curves given to EES from 
ENA.  You will note that there is a very significant increase (approximately 
60% in some cases) between April 18 and April 25.  No reason has been 
attributed to the increase that any of the EES people I have talked to know 
about.  Speculation is that it is due to our inability to do physical deals 
(load following and balancing).  I believe that is probably the cause along 
with rising into Cinergy prices.  This is what precipitated my memo about the 
power swaps.  I got a green light from both EES and ENA to proceed and am 
waiting to hear back from AEP if they are willing to meet.

The issue of finding a solution to balancing and load following has to be the 
number one agenda item for the midwest because it is destroying our ability 
to do deals anywhere.  Mike Roan and I are working on a strategy to address 
the issue through the RTO on a longterm basis.  My hope is that negotiations 
with individual receptive utilities can provide interim solutions for us.

ComEd has filed at FERC for an increase in transmission rates underwhich their revenue requirement would double to approximately $340 million, an 83.15% increase in the monthly rate.  Ancilliary charges will increase by 26%.  According to Ex. CEC-300, the charges would be as follows:

	*Annual charge ($/kw/yr) -   20.86
	*Monthly charge ($/kw/mo) - 1.74
	*Weekly charge ($/kw/wk) -  0.40
	*Daily charge ($/kw/day) -    0.080 capped at Weekly Charge
	*Hourly charge ($/kw/hr) -    5.01 capped at Daily and Weekly Charge

The issue is the effect on any transmission rate increase on our existing book of business and on our ability to competitively price power to new customers.  Unfortunately, given the weaknesses in the statute, the transmission rate increase impact will depend on how the ICC rules on our Motion to Dismiss in the ComEd rate case.  In that case, we have argued that increases to distribution are unlawful because they are not expressly permitted by statute.  If we get a favorable ruling, which should be issued perhaps next week, we will be in a better position to assess our ability to argue for an equitable outcome on transmission.  

Interestingly, on October 2, 2002, the ICC filed Comments in the ComEd case (Docket ER01-2992-000) at FERC in which they urge FERC to reject ComEd's levelized ratemaking proposal; initiate a hearing and investigation; and, suspend the rates pending investigation.  The ICC states that it is concerned that levelized rates "...would negatively impact retail competition in Illinois due to the fact that the transmission component of bundled retail rates in Illinois was determinined on a net plant basis.  With bundled retail rates effectively frozen in Illinois though the end of 2004,  any increase in the unbundled transmission rate will serve as a disincentive for retail customers to switch to unbundled service."  ICC concludes that this would take the competitive pressure off of Com Ed and goes on to mention that intervenors have raised similar issues in the DST case before the ICC. 

Once we have a ruling on the distribution rate increase, I will let you know.  From a procedural standpoint, we have intervened in this case at FERC and are expecting and Order in the next month setting forth the procedural schedule, so there is time to decide what we want to do and develop a strategy.
