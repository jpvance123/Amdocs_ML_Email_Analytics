Sean-

Transco's 4/1/01 filed rates for the path you're intersted in are as follows:

IT   Z3-Z4 Max Rate= $.2742 dth/d 
  GPS=   $.0097dth/d
  GRI=  $.0070dth/d
  ACA=  $.0022 dth/d




FT Z3-Z4 Demand
  Max Rate= $.2698dth/d
  GRI=  $.0030dth/d

FT Z3-Z4 Commodity
  Max Rate= $.0152dth/d
  GPS=  $.0097dth/d
  GRI=  $.0070dth/d
  ACA=  $.0022dth/d

As we discussed, the settlement process in this case has not even yet begun 
so it will be some time before we know what the final rates will be.  It's 
likely that the 40% requested increase will be cut in half...but until we see 
the Commission staff's top sheets (their assessment of Transco's case), I 
won't have a firm basis for making a prediction.  As a result, I'd suggest 
that you write into the agreement that the rate to be paid will be the "then 
applicable rate" or some similar language that gives you the ability to true 
up or down as needed.

If you'd like me to put together some language for your contract with respect 
to regulatory adjustment to the price, or need any additional information, 
please let me know.  II'll forward you the tariff sheets these rates are 
based on this morning.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Subject: HPL Meter



Here is the message I received from my technical folks. (below in red).
As you can see a lot of work is involved.  Let me know how much you would
plan to nominate at this point, etc.    And can they committ to a certain,
volume, etc.   Also,  have they talked to HPL about taking gas at this
point.


After visiting the site (M&R 71886/76886), I found the following work that
would need to be done before custody transfer measurement could be
performed :
 (The site has two 12" meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)
and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)

1. All valves will need to be inspected & overhauled
     A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for this
work)
     B. Control valves - inspected & overhauled (needs to be sent off for
this work)
     C. Small regulators overhauled
2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected
     A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled
     B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fitting
overhauled and tubes honed)
3. All transmitter need to be replaced
     A. Differential - 2
     B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)
     C. Pressure - 4
     D. Direct mount manifolds - 2
     E. UPS system
4. RTU boards need to be furnished
     A. Mother board
     B. STI REM
     C. Main terminal board
     D. Serial IO LEM
     E. Analog Output board
5. New batteries ( 4 @ $ 160)
6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50" increments through Beta range)

It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls and
associated valves, meter runs, and EGM.  If you need more information
please let me know.

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas 
Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect 
under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism 
and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has 
increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 
31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of 
their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in 
their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the 
annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a 
surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern 
proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 
12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the 
surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / 
comment.  These types of dollars are usually "rubber-stamped" by FERC for 
pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us 
some grounds to protest the recovery.

 The full filing can be found at :  
http://infopost.link.duke-energy.com/infopost/default.asp?pipe=TE

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional 
information.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Following is from today's Inside FERC.  The Commission rejected Phase III b=

Transco filed contracts for 210,000dth/d, representing firm commitments,
rather than for the 404,000/dth/d proposed in the original application.  Th=

delay in filing was caused by the protracted negotiations over siting=20

the capacity needed to serve the NY/NJ market and may improve the=20
chances for success of the other proposed projects in the NYC area sponsore=

Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. will have to start the FERC approval=
=20
process all over again for
more than half of its originally anticipated MarketLink capacity. In an Apr=
il=20
26 order, the commission said
previously granted certificate authority for 404,000 Dt/day of capacity on=
=20
the expansion into the New York
City metro area has expired.

Earlier this month, Transco tried to persuade FERC to allow it to build=20
sufficient facilities to move the
gas it had under contract for the project=01,s phase three--only 210,000 Dt=
/day=20
of the phase=01,s planned
404,000 Dt/day (IF, 23 April, 4). But that request doesn=01,t square with t=
he=20
commission=01,s Dec. 13 approval of
project phasing, said last week=01,s order (CP98-540). In the December ruli=
ng,=20
the commission said that
"should Transco desire to construct some configuration of the remaining=20
MarketLink facilities and
services that differ[s] from what has been authorized (in the Dec. 13 order=
),=20
Transco will be required to file
an application for a new certificate for those facilities."

As a result, Transco now has authority to build only 166,000 Dt/day of=20
phase-one capacity, scheduled
to be online Nov. 1, and 130,000 Dt/day of phase-two capacity, expected to =
be=20
in service Nov. 1, 2002.

"As the history of the MarketLink project amply demonstrates, we authorized=
=20
Transco to construct this
project on the basis that the capacity was fully subscribed. Now, almost=20
three years after Transco filed its
application, one year after we certificated the project, and four months=20
after giving Transco more time to
obtain contracts, Transco still does not have a market fully subscribing=20
phase three," said last week=01,s order.
Transco was required to show contracts by April 13 for the full 404,000=20
Dt/day capacity of phase three, and
when it couldn=01,t do so, certificate authority expired on that date, FERC=
 said.

"Of course, Transco is free to file a new application requesting certificat=
e=20
authority to construct and
operate the facilities needed" to provide phase-three service, the order=20
added.
In filings before FERC acted, the state of New York said Transco should be=
=20
given the go-ahead for
phase-three construction because "new capacity is needed to serve growth in=
=20
the traditional core market as
well as the rapidly increasing demand for gas to generate electricity in th=
e=20
New York City area." While only
a small percentage of the contracted phase-three volumes-- 25,000 Dt/day ou=
t=20
of 210,000 Dt/day-- is
designated for delivery to New York City, the shipments into the region=20
"should help to alleviate capacity
constraints and bring down the high market prices that have been experience=
d=20
over recent periods," the
state went on to say.

Expressing the contrary view, Rep. Bill Pascrell in a short but pointed=20
letter expressed his opposition to
the proposal to build downsized facilities for phase three.

Judy,
My customer is getting serious about the Transco Zn 4 delivered deal.  Can 
you call Transco and ask if we can get firm.  Would the rate on that be 
floating with the max rate for that month, according to the rate case 
settlement?
Thanks,
Sean

Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have 
devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all 
the holes in it you want.

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy

The higher of
St 65 Offer plus $.35
TCO Offer plus $.14

Good Luck

Hi Judy,

I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take 
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe 
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he 
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice 
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.  

Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast 
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the 
invoice will be faxed over to him.


Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!

Darla

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Subject: Any Petal Gas Storage Issues?

As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to 
build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to 
interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and 
Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket 
No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 
deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 
Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 
miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of 
about $94,343,700.

As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions 
and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for 
authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of 
certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the 
contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its 
affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.

Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of 
our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including 
another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request 
a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

TO: Existing Firm Transportation Shippers

RE: Offers For Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in
Conjunction with the Leidy East Expansion Project



Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line ("Transco") solicits offers
for the permanent relinquishment of firm transportation
capacity on the Transco system. Shippers holding capacity
with receipts at Leidy, PA and deliveries to Princeton
Junction or mainline points in Zone 6 may offer that
capacity for relinquishment, subject to the
conditions outlined below.


Transco intends to combine such relinquished capacity
with newly constructed capacity in order to render service
in Transco's Leidy East Expansion Project ("Leidy East").
In accordance with the Commission's order of April 26, 2001
denying Transco's request for clarification of the MarketLink
Order, the Leidy East project will provide service to
shippers that had executed contracts that were filed with
the Commission on April 13, 2001, as part of Phase 3 of the
MarketLink project.  The capacity of the Leidy East project
will be 130,000 Dts/d.  In order to meet the proposed in-
service date of November 1, 2002, Transco plans to file
a certificate application with the Commission for Leidy
East by the end of June.



Offers for capacity relinquishment may be made by
shippers with existing transportation services as defined
above and provided under Part 284(G) of the FERC's
regulations.

Valid offers must meet the following criteria:

1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing
shippers in Leidy East;

2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must
result in a lower cost of service for the project than if
additional facilities were constructed;

3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished
capacity must not exceed the primary contract term of
service for Leidy East;

4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be
accepted from shippers who have contracted for service
under Leidy East;

5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s) and delivery
point(s) in each contract at which delivery point entitlements
(DPEs)will be reduced as a result of the relinquishment of firm
capacity to those points; and

6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.

Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00
PM CST on Monday, May 21, 2001. After receipt of offers to
relinquish capacity, Transco will make any modifications
necessary to the design of the facilities to be constructed
to render service in Leidy East.

Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be
notified as to whether the offer complied with the
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity
will be accepted and utilized to render service in Leidy East.
If more capacity is offered than is needed in Leidy East,
preference will be given to those offers which reduce the
cost of Leidy East to the greatest degree. In the event of
a tie, preference will next be given to those offers which
have the shortest remaining term for the capacity
relinquished.

Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in
Leidy East will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth
in their Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General
Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until
Leidy East firm transportation service commences through the
relinquished capacity.  The Leidy East firm transportation
service is expected to commence on November 1, 2002.
The relinquishing shipper's service agreement(s) will be
terminated or reduced effective on the actual in service date.
Transco's acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be
subject to the following:

1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);

2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to
such capacity, if applicable;


3. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed
Leidy East facilities and service (including approval of this
capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to Transco in its
sole opinion.


In the event that Leidy East does not go forward for any reason,
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related
agreements shall be null and void.

Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement
should contact Nancy Hargrove at 713-215-2926.

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Subject: Gulfstream Maps

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

Notice to:  All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, Interconnecting
Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line
Corporation System

Subject:  North Terrebonne Processing Plant - Notice of Force Majeure

Transco received the following notice today from the operators of the
Terrebonne plant.

 "In accordance with Article XVII of the above referenced
agreement please be advised that the North Terrebonne Gas Processing
Plant and Tebone Fractionation Plants shut down yesterday, May 10,
2001.  The shut down was due to a propane leak on the suction side of
one of the refrigeration compressors at North Terrebonne.  An incident
investigation team is preparing to investigate the exact cause of the
leak.  Present estimates of the duration of the shut down are uncertain
but may be as long as three to five days."

As a result of this outage, delivery points on Transco will see a
temporary increase in the heating content (Btu) of the quantities
received from the Transco system.  Transco expects the situation to be
alleviated shortly per the above notice and will provide an update as
it is received from the plant operators.

If you have any questions, please contact your Transportation
Scheduling Representative.

final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20

Hey you guys.... 

Just a quick bit of info for you regarding HI 177.? The reason the 
measurement is so inconsistent is the the readings are received from a 
telephone line that has been out for some time.? This platform offshore is 
unmanned, therefore our measurement group relies on the telemetry from the 
phone lines.? So, to make a long story short, the measurement you are seeing 
in probably wrong.? The lead data is showing that the measurement number is 
the same from the 3rd through the 18th, which cannot be right.? They are 
working on it, but to be honest with you, these people don't get in a hurry 
for anything.? When I get better numbers from a crew going offshore, I will 
put them in, probably tomorrow.? In the meantime, your imbalance will be 
changing.

Just wanted you guys to be more informed. 

Take care and keep in touch when you can. 

(I miss you guys...............)

Do we do any business on Chandeleur?  They have filed to expand their system 
by about 40,000 Mcf/d and to interconnect with Destin Pipeline at the 
Pascagoula Chevron refinery.  Apparently there was an open season.

Please let me know within the next couple of days whether we should intervene 
or not.  I have never had any inquiries or expressions of interest in 
Chandeleur, so I will assume not unless I hear from you otherwise.

The Fundy site now has updated price indices for both the east and west 
desks.  "EOM Price Index" is now "EOM East Price Index" and for the west 
desk, it is Price Data/EOM West Price Index.  Feel free to give me a shout if

Just a reminder that our day 1-7 volumes at HI 235 will be zero due to 
Transco Shut in. They have a boat in the field and our understanding is that 
the repairs are on schedule.

FYI.  At the last technical conference, National Fuel agreed to provide two 
hours notice on intra-day recalls, up from their one-hour proposal.  We will 
track their filing to make sure they don't file something else.

Conference


David Reitz of National Fuel indicated that the pipeline is back to its 
position before the last technical conference with regard to keeping the TBF 
fee a part of the imbalance resolution process as opposed to making it a 
separate service.  As a fall back position, National Fuel will seek guidance 
from FERC as to whether it should be made into a new service.  To make PA OCA 
happy, David Reitz indicated that any future proposal will incorporate the 
50-50 sharing that is in the current proposal.

National Fuel plans to make a revised pro forma tariff filing in mid-January 
and inform FERC that this filing resulted from the collaborative effort of 
parties to the proceeding.  The filing will have reservation of rights 
language that preserves National Fuel's right to file something completely 
different when it files to place the revised tariff sheets into effect.  
Prior to making the filing, National Fuel will circulate the explanatory 
transmittal letter and pro forma tariff sheets, and will flag any changes 
made to the pro forma tariff sheets.  This pre-filing circulation should 
occur some time during the first two weeks in January.

Nothing was said about the intra-day recall provisions.

Yes, please.  I have another meeting, so I probably won't be able to dial
in.  What are the directions, just in case?

Let me know if they try to make any changes in the intraday recall
provisions.

Thanks.

Do you want us to participate in the telephone conference tomorrowat 10:00
Eastern time?  I haven't seen any revised tariff sheets, so I'm not quite
sure what will be discussed besides National Fuel's decision not to make
the TBF service a separate service.

Subject: TE Pipeline Maintenance Revision

May 11, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission (TE) will have planned maintenance work
beginning at 9AM, Tuesday, May 15 and ending at 9AM Thursday, May 17 on
the discharge of Blessing Compressor Station (BLE) and on the McAllen
line downstream of the Pemex Interconnection (PMX).  TE requests that
prior to and during this period, to the maximum extent possible,
shippers ensure that scheduled receipts into the system do not exceed
scheduled deliveries out of the system in STX, ETX or the 24" system.

This maintenance will block all gas moving East through Blessing
Compressor Station, and due to the resulting limited capability to move
gas out of STX/ETX, there will be a systematic scheduling required for
all receipts between Blessing Station and Fagus Compressor Station (FGS)
on the 24" system beginning at 9AM on gas day Tuesday, May 15. Based on
currently scheduled volumes, the cuts could have a significant impact on
scheduled receipts in the area specified.  TE strongly recommends TABS
parties rank their markets prior to 11 AM Monday.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet 
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have 
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you 
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you 
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to 
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They 
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above 
the 15,000/d of FT.

Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for 
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA

Thanks for your help.

Scott:

Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:

>From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge

from Venice     .05 demand charge

from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246 
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)

In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.

The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.

Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the 
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we 
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or 
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly 
balancing at any point during the contract term.
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event 
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the 
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences 
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.

As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered 
price to Ormet.

Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is 
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one 
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

Craig

Subject: Flash Gas Meeting Recap(4/23/2001)

Recap of today's meeting covering Transco's Flash Gas.

Problem:
Flash gas purchase by ENA from TDC not recorded(pathed) in Unify
Commodity gas pathed in Unify and actualized in Unify, but actualized volumes 
may have included flash gas volumes for various months in order to tie out 
with the pipeline
Transco paid ENA for Imbalance gas(Cashin)
ENA never paid TDC for Flash gas

Solution:
Logistics will create Deal Ticket to capture Flash Gas previously not 
recorded(pathed)
Deal #745628  March 2000 - Feb. 2001(East Desk)
Deal #745637  March 2001 - until  (Gulf 1 - Desk)
Logistics will create paths to capture Flash Gas activity for all prior 
months(paths will be of actual flow amount per TDC Statement - refer to  
Alton's worksheet)
The new paths will not be to any Internal/External Pools, but to K#4983 to 
capture imbalance amount
Alton will then actualize volumes based on Transco Pipeline Statement(they 
should match TDC invoiced amount)
Alton will verify that all cash out' s for prior months tie to Transco's 
pipeline statement. In addition Alton will confirm that the imbalance did not 
include any Flash gas volumes in the calculations
Alton will reverse out any Manual payment made to Transco(if any?) and 
replace it with Unify System adjusted entries
Mary Ellenberger will verify rates to be paid to TDC with the trader and pay 
TDC for Flash Gas once approved
Going forward logistic will create pathes capturing Flash Gas volumes
Target dated of completion no later than April 25, 2001

If there is anything that was left off this list to do please let me know. 

Thanks for all of your help in resolving this problem.
