1. Be sure to read the country sections on Brazil, Ghana, and Ireland in
this week's FT.  You do not need to read each sectoral article (gold, real
estate, etc.) but read the overall articles and 2-3 others.

Typical questions for material we have covered:
* What has Ghana done right concerning growth?  What more should they do?

We have not yet covered the material, but think about for weeks to come:
*  Why does the article claim that Ireland fears a weak British pound?
* Why does ECB policy on interest rates not match Ireland's needs?  Does
that mismatch mean  joining the Euro-zone was a bad idea?

* Will Brazil or Ghana grow faster over the next generation?  What
contingencies might affect your answer?

2. Thida contributed this article on unemployment from the Economist, 2-Oct=
-99

The economy: Work ethic


ON THEIR way to winning the general election in 1979, the
Conservatives put up posters claiming that =0F"Labour isn=0F't working=0F".=
 Next
time, Gordon Brown told the Labour Party conference this week, the message
=0F"Labour is working=0F" should be splashed across the nation=0F's billboa=
rds. Since
Labour returned to office in May 1997, the number of people in work has
risen to 27.4m, a record high, and unemployment has tumbled. No wonder that
the chancellor had the confidence to proclaim that =0F"Britain can deliver,=
 in
our generation, employment opportunity for all... full employment for our
country.=0F"
Were the unemployment figures your guide, you might think that Britons were
already fully employed. The proportion of the workforce claiming the dole,
4.2%, is the lowest since February 1980. The proportion who are =0F" ILO
unemployed=0F"=0F-the definition used by the International Labour Organisat=
ion in
Geneva which, in essence, means those looking for work=0F-is 5.9%, the lowe=
st
since records began in 1984.

There is, however, more to the labour market than the unemployment rate. Th=
e
government=0F's Labour Force Survey divides the population into three: the
employed, the ILO unemployed, and the =0F"economically inactive=0F"=0F-ie, =
those who
are neither in work nor looking for it. Statistics for all three groups
taken together paint a less pretty picture than do the unemployment data
alone.

Start with employment. Although the number in work is higher than ever, the
proportion is lower than at its peak in 1990. Then, 75.2% of people of
working age (men aged 16 to 64, women aged 16 to 59) were employed. Now, 74=
%
are. With the employment and unemployment rates both down, it follows that
inactivity is higher=0F-by 2% of the working-age population=0F-than in 1990=
.

In part, this is because youngsters are spending longer in education. Their
absence from the labour market is temporary, and they should join it better
equipped. However, inactivity has also increased among workers (actually,
men) over 25.

As the shows, the unemployed comprise a smaller share of the population tha=
n
in 1990. Women are more likely to be in work and less likely to be inactive
than they were. But men have become less likely to work and more likely to
be outside the labour market altogether. Much of this is a hangover from th=
e
recession of the early 1990s: since 1990, the male inactivity rate has rise=
n
by 4.4 percentage points: half of this rise had occurred by 1992, and more
than two-thirds by 1994.

Many of the men who lost jobs in the early 1990s never returned. Plenty
retired early. Many were pensioned off as long-term sick or disabled rather
than continuing to seek work. Although the population as a whole was no les=
s
healthy, the number of long-term sick rose from about 300,000 in 1992 to
more than 750,000 last year.

How much has this depleted the labour force? It is impossible to be exact,
but suppose that the same proportion of men aged between 25 and 50 was
economically active now as in 1990. Then labour supply would be higher, by
around 330,000. Were the employment rate for these men the same as it was
then, an extra 218,000 would be in work. For men aged 50-64, labour supply
is short by 152,000 and employment by 64,000.

This trend is not peculiarly British. Most developed countries have seen me=
n
=0F's employment and activity rates fall and women=0F's rates rise. And Bri=
tain
has fewer inactive men, relative to its population, than most other OECD
countries. Nonetheless, Britain still wastes too many workers.

The government=0F's main answer to long-term joblessness, the New Deal, has=
 so
far mainly been aimed at those aged under 25, and at those of that group wh=
o
say they are seeking work rather than the inactive. Ministers claim that
this programme is achieving great things. In fact, it is too early to tell.
Yes, long-term unemployment has fallen among the young since Labour took
office. But then it has fallen for all age groups, and most of the decrease
came during the party=0F's first year, before the New Deal was in operation=
.

So far, however, less has been done for older workers. A programme to help
them into work, New Deal 25-plus, has been running in pilot form since June=
.
A scheme is also being set up for over-50s. In his conference speech this
week, Mr Brown promised to extend the New Deal to become a =0F"Permament De=
al=0F":
a recognition, perhaps, that =0F"full employment=0F" as the chancellor defi=
nes it
may be a long time coming.

1. For this week, please be sure you have read a story on determinants or 
costs
of long-term or very high inflation and/or on very high or long-term
unemployment.  Later in the course we will examine changes in unemployment and
inflation (and their relation) in the short run; this week we focus on
definitions and long-run determinants and costs.  (Hint: for unemployment, 
what
has happened to the workweek in France?)

2. Concerning growth, you might want to look at:  Report: Corruption Ruining
Economies Of South Asia
        http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/19991101/wl/asia_un_1.html
(a Reuters story)

3. Concerning measurement of "The New Economy," a fellow student recommends 
the
Economist article at
http://www.economist.com/editorial/freeforall/current/index_fn8276.html
will all the pretty pics and graphs, or the plain text version below.


E-xaggeration: The digital economy is much smaller than you think

NEWSPAPERS and magazines are packed with stories about the digital economy,
the information-technology (IT) revolution and the Internet age. That their
pages are filled with advertising from IT firms presumably has nothing to do
with it. Such firms account for a quarter of the total value of the S&P 500,
and this week Dow Jones announced that Microsoft, Intel and SBC
Communications will be included in its industrial average from November 1st.
Not before time, many say, for high-technology businesses now account for a
huge chunk of the economy. Actually, they don't.
New figures published on October 28th by America's Department of Commerce
appear to support the view that IT is very important to the American
economy. The department now counts all business spending on software as
investment (previously, it was a cost). This has both increased the apparent
size of IT investment and boosted America's rate of growth in recent years.
But measuring the size of the "new" economy is a statistical minefield. The
most generous estimate comes from the OECD, which tracks the
"knowledge-based economy". It estimates that this accounts for 51% of total
business output in the developed economies-up from 45% in 1985. But this
definition, which tries to capture all industries that are relatively
intensive in their inputs of technology and human capital, is implausibly
wide. As well as computers and telecoms, it also includes cars, chemicals,
health, education, and so forth. It would be a stretch to call many of these
businesses "new".
A study published in June by the Department of Commerce estimates that the
digital economy-the hardware and software of the computer and telecoms
industries-amounts to 8% of America's GDP this year. If that sounds rather
disappointing, then a second finding-that IT has accounted for 35% of total
real GDP growth since 1994-should keep e-fanatics happy.
Perhaps unwisely. A new analysis by Richard Sherlund and Ed McKelvey of
Goldman Sachs argues that even this definition of "technology" is too wide.
They argue that since such things as basic telecoms services, television,
radio and consumer electronics have been around for ages, they should be
excluded. As a result, they estimate the computing and
communications-technology sector at a more modest 5% of GDP-up from 2.8% in
1990. This would make it bigger than the car industry, but smaller than
health care or finance. In most other economies, the share is lower; for the
world as a whole, therefore, the technology sector might be only 3-4% of
GDP.
But what, you might ask, about the Internet? Goldman Sachs's estimate
includes Internet service providers, such as America Online, and the
technology and software used by online retailers, such as Amazon.com. It
does not, however, include transactions over the Internet. Should it?
E-business is tiny at present, but Forrester Research, an Internet
consultancy, estimates that this will increase to more than $1.5 trillion in
America by 2003. Internet bulls calculate that this would be equivalent to
about 13% of GDP. Yet it is misleading to take the total value of such goods
and services, whose production owes nothing to the Internet. The value added
of Internet sales-ie, its contribution to GDP-would be much less, probably
little more than 1% of GDP.
This is not to deny that the Internet is changing the way that many firms do
business-by, for example, enabling them to slim inventories-but, in the near
future, as a proportion of GDP, it is likely to remain small.
A Luddite's lament

If measuring the size of the technology sector is hard, calculating its
contribution to real economic growth is trickier still, because the prices
of IT goods and services (adjusted for quality) have fallen sharply relative
to the prices of other goods and services. For example, official figures
show that America's spending on IT has risen by 14% a year in nominal terms
since 1992, but by more than 40% a year in real terms. This figure is so
high partly because it is extremely sensitive to assumptions about the rate
at which the price and quality of IT is changing.
The Commerce Department calculates that the technology sector has
contributed 35% to overall economic growth over the past four years. But
because such figures are based on spending in real terms, the Goldman Sachs
study reckons they are misleading. In nominal terms, IT has accounted for a
more modest 10% of GDP growth in the past four years.
Another popularly quoted figure is that business spending on IT has risen
from 10% of firms' total capital-equipment investment in 1980 to 60% today.
But again, this is based on constant-dollar figures, and so it hugely
exaggerates the true increase. In terms of current dollars (and before the
latest revisions), Goldman Sachs calcuate that business investment in
computers accounts for 35% of total capital spending, not 60%. And even this
exaggerates the importance of IT, because much of the money goes to replace
equipment which becomes obsolete ever more quickly. The share of IT in
additional "net" investment is much smaller. Computers still account for
only 2% of America's total net capital stock.
For years economists have been seeking in vain for evidence that computers
have dramatically raised productivity. One explanation for the failure of
productivity to surge may be that official statistics are understating its
growth. Another is that much investment in IT has been wasted: hours spent
checking e-mail, surfing the Net or playing games reduce, not increase,
productivity. A third may simply be that IT is still too small to make a
difference: for the moment, appropriately enough, you can count the digital
economy on the fingers of one hand.
That is changing, and firms are learning. And note this: if you add in all
computer software and telecoms (on the widest definition), the share of IT
in the capital stock rises to 10-12%. As it happens, this is almost the same
as railways at the peak of America's railway age in the late 19th century.
Railways boosted productivity and changed the face of Victorian commerce.
Hype is hype-but the new economy may yet happen anyway.

David Levine    November 18, 1999
B.A. 201B       Macroeconomics

        Some Open Economy Macroeconomics

        Accounting:  Recall that Net Exports =3D NX =3D Exports - Imports.
Also, in
an open economy, Y =3D C + I + G + NX.  When exports rise, foreigners buy m=
ore=20
of
our output; thus, aggregate demand for domestically produced goods rises. =
=20
When
imports rise we are buying from foreigners, so imported purchases do not en=
ter
domestic aggregate demand.

        NX =3D trade surplus =3D -trade deficit =3D net borrowing from abro=
ad.  When
NX is negative (imports > exports), we have a trade deficit.  This is finan=
ced
by borrowing from abroad.  To a first approximation, when the US spends mor=
e=20
on
exports than it earns on imports, it needs to borrow to make up the
difference.

        The trade deficit is not exactly equal to borrowing from abroad=20
because
of the returns from net foreign assets.  When the US was a creditor nation,=
 it
also made money on its investments abroad--this income permitted a modest=
=20
trade
deficit without borrowing.  Now, as a debtor nation, a modest trade surplus=
 is
required to avoid the need for new borrowing.  (We are also ignoring=20
government
buying and selling of currencies.)  The Current Account Surplus =3D Exports=
 -
Imports + interest and profits received from net foreign assets.

        Exchange rates:  An exchange rate is the price of one currency in=
=20
terms
of another.  For example, a French Franc (FF) costs 15.7? yesterday, while =
it
was 10? when I traveled in France in 1985.

        The US currently has floating exchange rates, meaning that the valu=
e=20
of
the dollar fluctuates.  The is about 105.8 yen today, but has varied from
103.76 to 124.44 in the last 12 months.  Thus, the dollar bought fewer yeni=
t
weakenedover much of the last year.

        Under fixed exchange rates there would, in principle, be no day-to-=
day
changes in the exchange rate.  The Federal Reserve would buy and sell dolla=
rs
and foreign currencies to keep the exchange rate fixed.  The float is a lit=
tle
bit "dirty," since the Fed and other central banks intervene on currency
markets (i.e., buy and sell dollars) to affect the value of the dollar.

        Unlike the U.S., most nations in the world fix their exchange rates
with
someone.  A few dozen use common currencies: the West African Franc is used=
 by
many former French colonies and Panama uses the $U.S.  Other countries such=
 as
Argentine or Hong Kong promise to keep as many U.S. dollars (or DM) as they
have circulating currency; this "currency board" arrangement makes a fixed
exchange rate credible because if folks want to sell the local currency, th=
ere
are always dollars or DM to redeem them.

        The value of the dollar: Many factors affect the value of the
dollar: US
and foreign aggregate demand, U.S. and foreign interest rates, speculative
bubbles, and so forth.  The dollar becomes stronger (i.e., can buy more of =
a
foreign currency) when US real interest rates (r) are high.  If r is high,=
=20
then
foreigners want to buy dollars in order to put them into US banks and recei=
ve
the high interest rate.  When the demand for dollars goes up, so does its=
=20
price
in terms of foreign currencies -- it gets stronger.

The net demand for dollars is low and the dollar will depreciate (weaken)=
=20
when:


     *  Foreigners don't want to buy U.S. goods (U.S. exports low, foreigne=
rs
importing little);

     *   US want to buy foreign goods (U.S. imports high, foreigners
exporting a
lot).  US AD high implies leakage to foreign markets, IM high.

     *  Foreigners don't want to buy U.S. assets, often when U.S. interest
rates
are low.

     *  U.S. wants to buy foreign assets, often when foreign real interest
rates
are high.

     *  People think $ will get even weaker.  This adds a speculative
dimension,
so speculative bubbles sometimes appear to be important, as are expectation=
s=20
of
foreign or US changes in policy.

        A Morality Play of International Trade

Chris and Pat were having a conversation one day upstairs at Kip's.

Chris: Pat, I don't see how you can be for free trade.  If Taiwan grows fas=
ter
than us, we will lose.

Pat: Chris, you clearly do not understand the great economist Ricardo's ide=
a=20
of
Comparative Advantage.

C: That's for sure, I don't.  Wazzat?

P: Comparative advantage is what you are least worst, or most best at.  For
example, this great entrepreneur whose name escapes me was the world's fast=
est
typist, but hired a secretary nevertheless.  He was perhaps 5 times as
productive as she was as an entrepreneur, but only 3 times as productive as=
 a
typist--thus, he had absolute advantage in both, but she had comparative
advantage in typing.

C: So what does that have to do with free trade?

P: An example may clarify.  Step over to this handy blackboard, and let me
write a bit.  First, imagine a world with two countries, the US and Taiwan,=
=20
and
two goods, computers and wine.  Further, assume that labor is the only inpu=
t
into production.  Each country has 100 hours of labor.

First consider a case with no trade, when each nation's output equals their
consumption:

                        USA WITH NO TRADE


        Product                 Productivity            Output

        computers               30 hrs / PC              2
        wine                    2 hrs / bottle          20

          total hours =3D 30 * 2 + 2 * 20 =3D 100


                  TAIWAN WITH NO TRADE

        Product              Productivity               Output

        computers               10 hrs / PC              8
        wine                    1 hrs / bottle          20

          total hours =3D 10 * 8 + 1 * 20 =3D 100


Note that Taiwan makes computers in 1/3 the US time, and wine in 1/2 the US
time.  Thus, Taiwan has absolute advantage at both wine and computers.  Tai=
wan
has comparative advantage (is most best at) computers.  US has comparative
advantage (is least worse at) wine.

Now let's see what happens if we permit trade.  The US will specialize in=
=20
wine,
what it is best at.  The world price will be about 12 bottles of wine per P=
C=20
in
the world with trade.

                     USA WITH TRADE

        Product         Productivity            Output    Consumption


        computers               30 hrs / PC              0        2
        wine                    2 hrs / bottle          50        26
        wine                    2 hrs / bottle          50        26



          total hours =3D 0 * 30 + 2 * 50 =3D 100
          consumption of wine =3D production - 24 sold to Taiwan
          consumption of computers =3D 2 bought from Taiwan


                   TAIWAN WITH TRADE

        Product         Productivity            Output    Consumption


        computers       10 hrs / PC             10          8
        wine            1 hrs / bottle           0         24


          total hours =3D 10 * 10 + 0 * 1 =3D 100


Both countries receive at least as much of both goods after trade.  (The ex=
act
price with free trade, and therefore the amount of consumption in each=20
country,
depends on the demand elasticities in the two countries and other factors.)
Thus, in a world of comparative advantage, trade helps both countries! =20
Nations
should specialize in what they do best.  Complete specialization, as in thi=
s
example, is an extreme case. As Adam Smith pointed out 200 years ago,
specialization permits all to grow wealthier.

C: Your argument assumes quite a bit.  Implicit in your example is the
assumption that when the US quits producing computers, all of those Cory-ha=
ll
types be magically transformed into Vit & Eno majors from Davis.  If we are=
 in
a recession, then the computer workers who lose their jobs won't get new jo=
bs;
policies to protect our domestic industry can avoid unemployment and increa=
se
aggregate demand.

P: You are recommending "beggar-thy-neighbor" policies, since any gain in o=
ur
demand is offset by losses to our neighbors'.  If we get started on that ta=
ck,
the whole world loses.  Not everyone can increase demand by restricting
imports!

C: Even without the macroeconomic problem, there is still the unemployment
caused by free trade destroying industries.  How will all the ex-computer f=
olk
get the skills to make wine?

P: You are correct, and both US computer makers and Taiwanese wine makers=
=20
(both
companies and employees) prefer not to have trade in the short run.  The po=
int
is that the winners (i.e., US wine makers, Taiwanese computer makers, and
consumers in both countries) win more than the losers lose.

C: If free trade brings so many benefits, then it should bring enough
prosperity to compensate the losers.  It is not fair to the computer worker=
s
that they bear the cost of adjustment.  It makes sense to tax some of the
winners, and pay some subsidy to help the losers retrain.

Full employment is not your only key assumption.  You also assume that mark=
ets
are competitive, so that firms make no monopoly profits.  In fact, it appea=
rs
that some industries make big profits.  When we lose market share in these
industries, the capital flows to a less profitable industry.

P: Again, I must grant your point that there are monopolistic industries an=
d
most Americans would rather the monopoly profits stay at home.  In general,
free trade eliminates monopoly profits, and will help consumers enormously.

C: Yes, but in addition to there being high-profit industries, there are
high-wage industries, so workers care which industry they are in.  When we=
=20
lose
market share in these industries, the workers move to industries with lower=
=20
pay
and lower productivity.  Autoworkers who become hamburger flippers are not
making a marginal switch to their next best-paying job.

For example, Boeing has traditionally made big profits, and paid its worker=
s
well.  When Europeans subsidized Airbus and we lost airplane manufacturing
jobs, we lost both those high profits, and the workers had to move to
lower-wage employers.

P: I agree that it is theoretically possible for subsidies to increase a
nation's welfare, if the subsidies bring oligopoly profits and high-wage jo=
bs.
Nevertheless, it would be better for everyone if nobody subsidized, and=20
markets
were more competitive.  In the US today, both imports and exports are mostl=
y
made in high-wage jobs.  Thus, we should favor the expansion of trade, not
restrictions.

C: Your hypothetical situation is irrelevant, since other nations are
subsidizing.  Japan is famous for protecting its industries until they beco=
me
big enough to compete internationally--then, watch out!

P: Do you really think that the US steel, auto and computer industries are =
too
small to compete internationally?

C: Well, I have to admit that USX, GM and IBM are not what one usually thin=
ks
of as part of infant industries.  But the Japanese also subsidize industrie=
s
and dump exports below cost in order to drive competitors out of business.
Once they have a monopoly, then they really gouge.

P: Have the Japanese really increased prices of color TVs, RAM chips, or ot=
her
goods?  Anti-dumping laws primarily mean that foreigners are not allowed to=
=20
cut
prices--price cuts that would benefit US consumers.

Even with an uneven playing field, I disagree with you.  As usual with
protectionists, you ignore consumers.  When European subsidies created Airb=
us,
Airbus made the market for passenger aircraft much more competitive.  US
consumers won in terms of lower airfares--something you forgot to stress in
your arguments about Boeing's loss of high profits and high-wage jobs.

I am very suspicious of these claims that we need to protect all sorts of
industries, since it gives companies enormous incentives to pour money into
lobbying.  The large firms of the US steel industry have been incredibly
successful at lobbying for protection.  This protection has mostly protecte=
d=20
an
inefficient oligopoly, at great cost to US consumers.

C: But we sometimes need protection as a stick, to beat foreigners into=20
opening
their markets to us.

P: While protection can be a stick, it is not easy to wield.  It seems most
likely to lead to a trade war, where retaliation by foreigners leads them t=
o
close markets to us if we restrict trade.

Usually when we run protectionism, it is in the form of the misnamed
"voluntary" export restraint (VER), like the one that we have with the=20
Japanese
for automobiles.  These basically require the foreigners to form a cartel,
lower sales, and increase price.  I do not know why the US government helps
foreigners run cartels that hurt US consumers!  Anti-trust policy is suppos=
ed
to restrict cartels.  The auto VERs cost consumers over $100,000 for each
US job
that is saved.

C:  Well, I am not convinced.  All of your arguments concerning the advanta=
ges
of free trade are based on this notion of comparative advantage, which you
assume is somehow granted by nature.  In today's high-tech industries,
comparative advantage is won by experience in producing complicated
technologies, not by weather or natural resources.

P: If comparative advantage is won by experience, then experience in produc=
ing
becomes a sort of investment.  Why can't US firms undertake investments tha=
t
are profitable?  You cannot seriously believe that IBM is too small to comp=
ete
with foreigners.

C: But there are spillovers from one industry to another.  The experience o=
f
Silicon Valley, for example, shows that when one part of high-tech does wel=
l,
other parts learn from it and do well also.

Even your economists have always agreed that when there are positive
externalities that there is a role for public subsidies.  For example, an
innovating firm rarely captures all the gains of its research and developme=
nt.
In the example above, when new computer technologies are developed, only th=
e
Taiwanese will be able to develop the new products based on their expertise=
 in
PC manufacture.

P: I agree that companies providing positive spillovers should be encourage=
d.
I think that support of university research, coupled with an R&D tax credit
makes more sense than protectionism.

You, on the other hand, seem to be promoting an "industrial policy," in whi=
ch
the government picks winners to promote.  Didn't the billions of dollars th=
at
France and Britain poured into the Concorde supersonic transport, as well a=
s
wastage of the US with Synfuels synthetic gasoline teach you that industria=
l
policy won't work?

C: Well aren't you self-righteous.  The US has always had a multitude of
vigorous and expensive industrial policies, they have just gone under a=20
variety
of other names and have never been coordinated to work together.  Agricultu=
re
receives billions in subsidies, steel and textiles have quotas on imports,
Lockheed and Chrysler received government-backed loans, and housing gets th=
e
mortgage interest deduction.  Perhaps most importantly, a vast proportion o=
f
our research is funded by the military, which has always looked to advantag=
es
for certain industries.

All I want is a rational and democratic industrial policy.  We should
coordinate
our goals, and choose our subsidies more democratically and in ways that do=
=20
not
work to cross-purposes.  For example, any bailouts or protection from impor=
ts
should be short run, and explicitly tied to promises to invest in new=20
machinery
and new skills for workers.  New technologies to be promoted should be chos=
en
by democratically-chosen representatives, not by nameless bureaucrats at DA=
RPA
(the Defense Advanced Projects Research Administration)--an agency almost
nobody has heard of.

P: I would just as soon cut subsidies to all those industries as adjust wha=
t
subsidies I give.  Nevertheless, I grant you that if subsidies are given th=
ey
should at least include promises from the industry and its workers to inves=
t,
not just enjoy high current wages and profits.

C: You're starting to talk sense now.  We must always keep in mind that=20
America
needs high tech to maintain its competitiveness.

P: I don't understand this word "competitiveness."  I, like you, would like=
 US
productivity to grow quickly so that we are more prosperous, and have more
resources to care for the disadvantaged, the environment, and so forth.  I=
=20
care
about the absolute level of US growth, not the relative level.

C: But if the US growth more slowly than Japan, we will lose our standing a=
s a
world power!

P: I am not thrilled about any nation being overwhelmingly powerful.  It is=
 ok
with me if the US must consult with its allies before invading various smal=
l
open economies.

C: Well, I have won enough points from you that I should probably stop.  Yo=
u
agree that (at least in theory) protectionism can help keep high-profit,
high-wage, and high-spillover industries at home, and raise national output=
.

P: I must agree in theory, and also remind you that the industries have
political clout to receive protectionism are often the worst-run. =20
Furthermore,
any protectionist policy leads to the risk of trade wars, and they make
everyone
worse off.

Hi everyone,

For this Saturday's section, I would like you guys to read (if you
haven't already) the article "Restructuring gives Japan's workers
culture shock: Radical cuts by Nissan's French boss have wide
implications for Japan's jobs-for-life practices"

from the 11/3 Fin. Times.

Please think about how you might answer the following questions:

1. Should the government extend unemployment benefits to the laid off
workers from Nissan?

2. Why have Japanes companies paid younger workers less, and older
workers more, Does this policy make sense?

3. Should Nissan consider lowering the wages of some workers in order to
layoff fewer workers?

I have attached a word 6.0 version of the article.  Also please note
that section is in C135.

In addition I will try to discuss questions on Ghana, Ireland and Brazil
that Prof. Levine sent out.

Also I have attached an article on asset prices and inflation targetting
(from the FT) which discusses the dangers of "debt deflation". If we
have time I might discuss this as well.

See you on Saturday.

First pegged exchange rates are the same as fixed exchange rate.  A
currency board goes further by promising by law that you will not change
the fixed rate (ie devalue).

In reality, r = r* does not hold perfectly.  It is a simplification
which we use to explain why under a fixed exchange rate system monetary
policy is inneffective...that there would be infinite capital flows to
the country with a higher interest rate.  I would read through Mankiw p
315 to 318 for a discussion on the risk premium which addresses your
question.

Now, the situations you refer to where a country chooses between
devaluation or raising interest rates occurs because a country is
drawing down its foreign reserves and despite the fat that r = r*, money
is flowing out. You can think of this as the introduction of a risk
premium, theta.  So that r = r* + theta. So r must now be raised in
order to preserve the capital flow equilibrium.

Without foreign reserves the central bank cannot honor the fixed
exchange rate.  Its choices then are either to raise the interest rates
sharply to preserve the currency or to devalue thereby raising net
exports and making it more expensive for foreigners to sell the domestic
currency (ie pesos) for dollars.  In the Mexico example in Mankiw, the
country did not raise rates and was eventually forced to devalue.

Often the idea is that a country should take the step to devalue before
it is in a crisis situation if it is not willing to cause a recession to
keep the exchange rate fixed.  This is what the IMF advised the Asian
countries months before the crisis.  They did not want to because of
credibility issues and fears that devaluing itself might precipitate a
crisis and raise the risk premium.  The problem is that if you wait too
long it becomes a fate accompli.

A currency is advocated by some because it replaces the central bank
with "a cash register" and solves the credibility issue.  The main
drawback is that you may have to cause a recession to honor your
exchange rate.

A new economy for the New World: Inflation may not be as dead as it seems

ONCE upon a time sailors went to
sea in the belief that the earth was flat, putting them at risk of dropping
off the edge. Fortunately the discovery that it was round solved that
problem. Economic thinking about monetary policy and inflation has undergon=
e
a similar about-turn.
In the 1960s, the conventional economic wisdom was that monetary policy
could reduce unemployment. The theoretical underpinning for this was the
Phillips curve, named after Bill Phillips, an economist from New Zealand
based at the London School of Economics. Mr Phillips, also a trained
engineer, constructed a machine to demonstrate the workings of the economy,
using water to represent liquidity. In 1958 he published a study showing
that between 1861 and 1957 some kind of trade-off between wage inflation an=
d
unemployment seemed to have been operating in Britain: when unemployment wa=
s
high, inflation was low, and vice versa. This seemed to suggest that centra=
l
banks could permanently reduce unemployment by tolerating a bit more
inflation.

A decade later, however, two American economists, Milton Friedman and Edmun=
d
Phelps, challenged this theory. The trade-off between inflation and
unemployment, they argued, was only short-term, because once people came to
expect higher inflation, they would demand higher wages, and unemployment
would rise back to its =0F"natural rate=0F", which depended on the efficien=
cy of
the labour market. There was no long-term trade-off between inflation and
unemployment: in the long run, monetary policy could influence only
inflation. If policymakers tried to hold unemployment below its natural rat=
e
(also known by an acronym, NAIRU , the non-accelerating inflation rate of
unemployment), inflation would be pushed ever higher.

Just as Messrs Friedman and Phelps had predicted, the level of inflation
associated with a given level of unemployment rose through the 1970s, and
policymakers had to abandon the Phillips curve. Today there is a broad
consensus that monetary policy should focus on holding down inflation. But
this does not mean, as is often claimed, that central banks are =0F"inflati=
on
nutters=0F", cruelly indifferent towards unemployment.

If there is no long-term trade-off, low inflation does not permanently chok=
e
growth. Moreover, by keeping inflation low and stable, a central bank, in
effect, stabilises output and jobs. Don Brash, governor of the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand, explains how this happens, using 4. The straight line
represents the growth in output that the economy can sustain over the long
run; the wavy line represents actual output. When the economy is producing
below potential (ie, unemployment is above the NAIRU ), at point A ,
inflation will fall until the =0F"output gap=0F" is eliminated. When output=
 is
above potential, at point B , inflation will rise for as long as demand is
above capacity. If inflation is falling (point A ), then a central bank wil=
l
cut interest rates, helping to boost growth in output and jobs; when
inflation is rising (point B ), it will raise interest rates, dampening dow=
n
growth. Thus if monetary policy focuses on keeping inflation low and stable=
,
it will automatically help to stabilise employment and growth.

The Fed clearly understands this relationship between inflation and the
output gap, but initial signs suggest that the ECB may underestimate the
extent to which it can safely hold interest rates low in the short run to
boost output and jobs. It has repeatedly said that lower interest rates
cannot reduce unemployment. That is undoubtedly true in the long run, but i=
f
an economy is operating below potential and the jobless rate is above the
NAIRU , then interest rates can safely be cut, and hence output boosted,
without pushing up inflation. Statements by ECB officials often appear to
suggest that all of the 10% unemployment rate in the euro area is structura=
l
and none of it cyclical. However, estimates from the IMF suggest that outpu=
t
in the area is currently almost 2% below potential, ie, the economy is
operating at point A . With growth in the euro area starting to pick up, th=
e
ECB is already muttering about a rise in interest rates. But it is far too
soon: the area still has a significant output gap that will continue to hol=
d
down inflation.

Is a bit of inflation good for you


When inflation was in double digits, central banks had a simple rule: bring
it down. But now that the rate in almost all rich economies is 2% or less,
they are being forced to ask: how low? This is hotly debated, because some
economists believe that inflation has economic benefits as well as costs.

Consider, first, the costs. When inflation is high, people find it difficul=
t
to distinguish between changes in average prices and changes in relative
prices. For example, a firm cannot tell if a rise in the price of copper
reflects general inflation or a scarcity of the metal. This distorts
important price signals, leading to a misallocation of resources. Inflation
also creates uncertainty about the future, which reduces investment. And
lastly, because of the way inflation interacts with tax systems, which are
never fully indexed for inflation, it reduces the real return on saving and
hence reduces future growth.

Inflation in double digits clearly does considerable harm, but what about
lower rates? And does 5% inflation do more damage than 2%, or zero? Yes,
answers Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic
Research*. He believes that even modest inflation can do significant damage
through its effect on saving. Tax is levied on nominal interest income, so
as inflation rises, the real after-tax return on savings comes down and
people save less, which depresses future growth rates. Mr Feldstein
estimates that in America a cut in inflation from 2% to zero would
permanently increase the level of GDP by 1%. To reduce inflation by two
percentage points would involve a one-off loss in output of 5% of GDP , but
the discounted present value of the future annual gains, of around 35% of
GDP , would far outweigh the loss. Zero inflation, he concludes, is a worth=
y
goal.

Yet there is little empirical evidence that lower inflation rates do
noticeably improve growth performance once inflation is below 5%, say. A
scatter plot of inflation against growth for a range of countries shows no
clear trend (see 5). A study by Robert Barro, an economist at Harvard
University, found that a reduction in inflation of one percentage point
increases the annual growth rate by a paltry 0.02 of a percentage point.

Some economists go much further, arguing that modest inflation, of perhaps
3-4%, is good for growth and employment. Nominal wages, they say, tend to b=
e
rigid downwards. Workers may be prepared to put up with flat wages when the
inflation rate is 3%, which amounts to a decline in real income, but they
are reluctant to accept a pay cut in money terms. So if the inflation rate
is zero, real wages cannot be adjusted downwards in declining industries or
regions, which means that unemployment will rise. Inflation, the argument
runs, greases the wheels of the labour market, allowing real wages to adjus=
t
more smoothly.

A widely cited study by the Brookings Institution=0F+, which examined pay i=
n
America since 1959, confirmed that very few people take nominal wage cuts i=
n
any year. However, the problem of wage =0F"stickiness=0F" may be overstated=
. There
have been few periods in the past when inflation has been less than 3% for
an extended period, so it is not surprising that falling wages are rare. If
inflation were to remain low, resistance to wage cuts might fade. Indeed, i=
n
Japan wages have been falling over the past two years. And as long as
productivity is rising, allowing unit labour costs to fall, there may be no
need for nominal pay cuts anyway. America=0F's recent experience certainly
suggests that nominal wage rigidities are no cause for concern: unemploymen=
t
has continued to fall even though average inflation over the past three
years has been only 2%.

A second common worry about zero inflation is that interest rates cannot
fall below zero, so there is no way of allowing real interest rates to
become negative to help the economy out of a recession. But the need for
negative real interest rates may be exaggerated. Mervyn King, a deputy
governor of the Bank of England, argues that negative real interest rates
have been rare in America during the past half-century=0F?. During most
recessions, low real interest rates have been enough to boost demand. The
only time when there might be a problem is if the economy suffers a shock
when the output gap is already large and inflation below target because
policymakers have failed to react to a previous slump in demand. A
pre-emptive policy which aims to prevent inflation going below target as
well as above, argues Mr King, minimises the need for negative real interes=
t
rates.

The final and most serious concern is that if central banks aim for zero
inflation, prices are more likely to fall for brief periods, and the
experiences of the 1930s and Japan today show that deflation can be more
dangerous than modest inflation. But falling prices are not necessarily a
problem. Before the first world war, a decline in the average price level
was quite common during periods of rapid technological change, such as the
late 19th century; yet these were also periods of strong growth. This is
quite different from the harmful sort of deflation seen during the Great
Depression. Moreover, the odd year of falling prices does not matter so lon=
g
as it does not feed expectations that they will continue to fall, causing
households to delay spending.

On balance, the benefits of retaining some inflation are probably
overstated. Price stability reduces uncertainty and so offers the best
economic environment for firms and households. So why do central banks not
invariably aim for zero inflation? The answer is that official
consumer-price indices tend to overstate the true rate of inflation in all
countries, because they do not adjust fully for improvements over time in
the quality of goods and services. Estimates suggest that in most countries
the official consumer-price index overstates inflation by around 0.5-2.0% a
year. This is the best reason why central banks should aim for a slightly
positive inflation rate.

Flat-earth economics


With rates of consumer-price inflation of 2% or under, most rich countries
have therefore more or less achieved =0F"price stability=0F". However, that=
 does
not mean that central bankers can go out on the town and celebrate. Despite
subdued inflation, the big three central banks all face their own particula=
r
dilemmas. Japan=0F's economy is still at risk from deflation. The ECB is ha=
ving
to deal with the added uncertainty of a completely new currency, which has
made the bank=0F's monetary policy extra cautious at a time when output in =
the
euro area is stuck below its potential. As for the American economy, the Fe=
d
is baffled because inflation is currently lower than any economic model
would have predicted.

Under the old economic rules, if unemployment fell below the NAIRU (thought
to be around 5.5%), inflation would start to rise. This, in turn, implied
that the maximum rate of growth the American economy could safely sustain
(adding up growth in the labour force and in productivity) was about
2.25-2.5%. Today America=0F's jobless rate stands at a 30-year low of 4.2% =
and
GDP has grown at an average rate of almost 4% a year over the past three
years. According to the textbooks, inflation should be rising. Instead,
America=0F's underlying inflation rate has remained subdued. Hence all the =
talk
about the Goldilocks economy=0F-neither too hot nor too cold.

One popular explanation of why strong growth has not pushed up inflation is
that the American economy is undergoing a paradigm shift. In this =0F"new
economy=0F", it is argued, information technology and increased global
competition have opened up new investment opportunities and boosted
productivity growth. Mr Greenspan himself frequently sings the praises of
the IT revolution, and talks of a =0F"once-a-century phenomenon=0F". Other
economists go further and argue that in this new era of low inflation the
Fed can throw away its rulebook: the notions of a NAIRU and a maximum
sustainable rate of growth have become redundant. Inflation is dead.

Then again, perhaps not. America=0F's productivity growth in the non-farm
sector has indeed increased, to an annual average of 2% over the past three
years, twice the average over the previous 25 years. The big question is
whether this is just a cyclical blip or a permanent increase in trend
growth. If (a big if) this increase is maintained, it may raise the economy=
=0F'
s non-inflationary speed limit to 3% a year, say. But that does not mean
there are no limits to growth: if it continues at its recent pace and the
labour market continues to tighten, inflation is bound to rise.

Some people may want to believe in economic miracles, but there is an
alternative explanation for America=0F's low rate of inflation. The country=
 has
benefited from four favourable factors. First, weak oil and commodity price=
s
until earlier this year, and a strong dollar and weak overseas demand,
especially in Asia, have held down import prices. Second, an investment boo=
m
has created excess capacity which has made it hard for firms to pass on wag=
e
increases in higher prices. Although unemployment is at a 30-year low,
America=0F's capacity utilisation is well below its historical average. Thi=
rd,
non-wage labour costs have been curbed by a booming stockmarket, which has
allowed firms to reduce their contributions to employee pension plans. And
fourth, the inflation rate has been nudged down by changes in the way of
measuring it.

By holding down prices, these factors have in turn helped to restrain wages=
.
But the old relationship between a tight labour market and wage growth
remains alive and well: real wage growth has accelerated over the past few
years, as you would expect when the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU .
This may have been temporarily offset by the favourable factors, but as
these effects wear off, inflation is likely to creep up again. Oil prices
are already rising; the dollar has slipped; and recovery in the rest of the
world will push up import prices. There are also signs that nominal wage
costs are now starting to pick up. Goldilocks is in danger of burning her
tongue, and the Fed may come to regret that it did not raise interest rates
sooner. Despite the increases this summer, real interest rates still remain
lower than a year ago.

Reports of the death of inflation are therefore much exaggerated. Far from
being dead, inflation may have taken on a new, more dangerous guise.

The discussion of free trade I circulated was short of discussion of some
hot topics these days.  Here is a continuation on environmental and labor
rights.

Environmental issues

Pat: The US had laws only permitting imported products if caught in ways
friendly to sea turtles and dolphins.  The WTO principle of regulating
products but not production processes ruled these laws out of bounds.

Chris: Some countries compete for companies to locate production facilities
by having lower environmental standards.  Thus, free trade puts poor
nations in competition with each other, halting them from regulating
environmental standards.  Instead, we see a "race to the bottom" where
environmental regulations are lax.

Pat: But a poor nation should be able to choose its own level of
regulations.  If lower regulations produces more jobs, why shouldn't a poor
nation be free to pick laxer regulation and less starvation?

Chris: Well, I am unsure of your definition of "nation."  In many poor
nations, the people who suffer from pollution are not informed of the
hazards and are not very politically powerful.  Instead, they are just poor
people who live downstream from a horrific factory or mine.

Pat: I acknowledge some regimes are undemocratic.  I just am unsure if
restricting trade with them will help the poor people you and I both care
about.

Chris: Speaking of undemocratic, the same "race to the bottom" shows up in
labor rights.  Nations with effective laws restricting child labor are at a
disadvantage to competitors where such laws are not enforced.  Similarly,
nations win the game of attracting foreign investors if they shoot union
leaders and otherwise restrict employees' rights.  Moreover, slave labor
remains present in some nations with various forms of indentured servitude.
 The WTO makes it illegal to sanction nations based on these horrific
practices.

Pat: Like you I oppose 10 years old in dangerous factories, slavery, and
shooting or imprisoning union leaders.  I just do not think trade barriers
are a very effective solution to most of these problems.  Children do not
work because their parents are mean, but because they are poor.
Restricting their work makes no sense and does not help them. If rich
nations want children in poor nations to go to school, we should be
subsidizing meals and tuition for schools in poor parts of the world, not
restricting poor families' already limited options.

Chris: So would you permit ANY deviations from widely agreed-on labor
standards.  According to your logic we should have have permitted trade
with Nazi Germany, just as you would encourage trade with China in spite of
its horrific human rights abuses.

Pat: We again agree on the horror of China and other nations' abuse of
human rights.  At the same time, WTO membership and a rising standard of
living seem the most likely ways to help democratic reformers in China.  I
remain unsure why we should undertake actions that hurt this opening
process, even if it assuages our conscience.

One element of net taxes is the transfer = interest payments on the public
debt.  Higher i raises interest payments and, thus, the goverment budget
deficit (G-T).

Same logic: Short-term loans need to be refinanced regularly (unlike long-term
fixed-rate bonds).  If I have loans that need to be refinanced, their
refinanced rate will be roughly 1/2 point higher this month than last due to
the actions of the ECB.

Another classmate asked...

>The senate plans to raise the minimum wage by $1 an hour over the next 3
years. Based on what we learnt in class, a wage hike would tend to typically 
go
to teenagers and not
to primary bread-winners.

Lots of min. wage workers are teens, but roughly 40% are low-income heads of
households.

Turnover is high in low-wage jobs, so employment might fall, but not due to
many layoffs -- just lower hiring.  The point remains that employment still
declines.  Most estimates are that the employment declines are quite small, so
that low-wage workers on average come out ahead with the rise.

1. =0F"A French Paradox at Work=0F" New York Times November 11, 1999     By=
 SUZANNE
DALEY

          FASTATT, France  Last year, the Beyer family, which owns a small =
jam
and fruit preserves plant here near the Swiss border, made a proposal to th=
eir
18 employees: Would they like a 35hour workweek and continue to be paid for
working 39 hours?
          To no one's great surprise, the employees said yes. "An hour more=
=20
for
yourself is  an hour more," said Christiane Grimm, whose job includes slapp=
ing
labels on jars,  sorting through crates of fruit and watching over bubbling
vats of jam. "There's  lots you can do with it."
      Surprisingly, the Beyers ended up happy, too. The company, one of
thousands of  French enterprises that have reorganized their businesses=20
because
of a  16monthold law creating one of the shortest workweeks in the world,
believes  that it is far better off than before.
      In the reshuffle, Philippe Beyer split his 18 employees into two team=
s
and  staggered their shifts. His factory here in the Alsace region now=20
operates
12 hours a day, up from 8. And it produces 30 percent more than it did last
year with only  two extra employees.
      The promise of 39 hours of pay for 35 hours of work was a campaign pl=
ank
that  helped catapult Lionel Jospin's leftist coalition to power in the 199=
7
Parliament  elections. And it remains the glue that keeps Socialists,
Communists and Greens  together. It was aimed at creating as many as a mill=
ion
jobs in a country that has  struggled with a doubledigit rate of unemployme=
nt
for years.
      But many experts think that this bold experiment  which business lead=
ers
had  warned would cripple France's economy  is not going to be a cureall fo=
r
the  nearly three million unemployed.
      Instead, it could accomplish something the leftist governing coalitio=
n
never aimed  for: a kind of housecleaning in the French workplace that will
tear the cobwebs  from French industry and lead to a more productive and
flexible work force, as it  did at Beyer.
      "The primary goal of this policy is very unlikely," said Emanuel Ferr=
y,
an  economist at Banque National de Paris, who is studying the policy. "But=
 it
seems  to be having a backdoor effect. It is providing a very good opportun=
ity
to  renovate the workplace. And it is introducing these elements
productivity,  flexibility  quietly without triggering social unrest. So ev=
en
if the direct goal of  job creation is not achieved, it may still not
necessarily be a bad thing for the  economy."
      That may be, but there is hardly a policy that has caused as much
argument in  France as the 35hour week. While labor was an early advocate o=
f
the idea, many  unions have recently demonstrated against it, fearing that =
the
way it is being  carried out will freeze salary levels and reverse hardfoug=
ht
gains in employee  rights. Businesses have protested, too. Last month, some
30,000 industrialists and  executives gathered in an empty Paris conference
center to wave placards and  chant slogans deploring the policy. They say i=
t
will cost too much and destroy  France's competitiveness.   Average citizen=
s
also seem to be losing their appetite for it. Surveys show that the  idea w=
as
very popular when first proposed, but resistance grew the more the  French
considered it. A recent poll found that less than 10 percent of France's
citizens now believe that they are going to benefit from shorter workweeks.
Most  people suspect that one way or another, they will be inconvenienced.
Either way,  it is a subject almost sure to start a fight.
      "People feel very strongly about it," Beyer said. "In this country we=
=20
are
a little retrograde, we live the way we lived 30 years ago, and this is=20
forcing
change and  so people are uneasy with it."
      So far, there is little proof that the 35hour week has created many=
=20
jobs.
Labor  Ministry officials said in Parliament recently that the plan had=20
created
or saved  120,000 new jobs. But one legislator called the figures "thin air=
,"
and most  economists say a more realistic number would probably be half tha=
t.
Opponents  also point out that the government has been subsidizing the
transition with  business tax cuts and other incentives.
      France's economy grew at a healthy rate of 3.2 percent in 1998, and i=
s
expected to do nearly as well this year. The unemployment rate has dropped =
to
11.1 in August  from a high of 12.6 percent in June 1997. But few see much
connection between the  new jobs and the 35hour policy.
      "The 35 hours was a political decision," a Finance Ministry official
said, "but it  may become a really positive thing. Nothing was moving befor=
e.
Now suddenly  everyone has to go back and look at the way we have been doin=
g
business.  People are talking and thinking and being creative."
      The process of carrying out this complicated law, passed in June 1998=
,=20
is
still in its early stages. This month, Parliament passed a tangle of more t=
han
100 amendments  spelling out exactly how and when the policy should be
instituted. One rule: All  companies with 20 employees or more must operate
with a 35hour workweek by  the year 2002. So far, only about 16,000=20
businesses,
or little more than 1 percent of  eligible French employers, have formally=
=20
made
plans for the conversion.
      Economists say the brunt of the law will be felt unevenly. Some
businesses like the Beyer factory will benefit. Others, including service
industries, are likely to have a  much harder time.
      George Jallerat, who owns Le Grand Monarque Hotel and Restaurant in
Chartres,  says he cannot figure out how to reduce his employees' hours, pa=
y
them the same  wages and not lose money. "In the end, we will have to raise
prices," he said.  "There is no other way."
      Some entrepreneurs are already taking steps to protect themselves. Dr=
.
Thierry  Sandr, employs 19 people in his medical lab on the outskirts of=20
Paris.
He says he  will do all that he can to avoid hiring a 20th person and bring=
=20
the
35hour  workweek into his business.
      But he does not trust the government to leave him alone. So he has no=
t
raised the  pay of any of his employees in two years, as a way of saving mo=
ney
for the day he  has to give them a 35hour workweek for 39 hours of pay. He=
=20
says
he is not alone.
      While the 35hour workweek was being debated, government officials beg=
an
trying to enforce the 39hour limit that now exists, even among managers.
Agents  prowled garages to see what time people were actually leaving.
Thousands of  fines were issued, and in one case, the director of a=20
electronics
factory owned by  ThomsonRCM was hauled into court for working too hard and
allowing his  engineers and other managers to put in an average of 46 hours=
 a
week. In June, he  received an $18,000 fine. The action prompted some
businesses to install time  clocks even for managers and made the governmen=
t
the butt of jokes.
      Those who have jumped at the shortened workweek are often those who w=
ere
already planning to expand their businesses. For instance, the Packard Bell
factory  in the western town of Angers, which makes computers, went to the
35hour week  this year precisely because it wanted to increase production b=
y=20
30
percent. To do  that, it needed to reorganize its 1,200 employees into more
teams and more shifts.  Offering a 35hour week was a way of opening
negotiations with its unions.
      JeanLuc Bayel, the director of human resources, said the plan had wor=
ked
out  even better than anyone expected. "We have far less absenteeism," Baye=
l
said.  "And we are seeing a better product. People have to stand to do the=
=20
job,
and  standing for eight hours is hard. Now they stand for only seven and we=
=20
are
seeing  a 5 percent reduction in problem computers. We are very happy with =
the
changes."
      Packard Bell did not take advantage of government subsidies because i=
t
did not  want to follow government rules. But others like Beyer also saw in=
=20
the
new law a  way of getting government aid to pay for expansion plans.
      At Beyer, for instance, the government aid package will pay nearly 90
percent of  the salary for the two employees he added this year. Next year,=
 it
will pay about 70  percent and 50 percent the year after that. But Beyer, w=
ho
took over the business  from his father two years ago, wanted to expand=20
anyway.
He says he might have  gone ahead with his plans anyhow, but the law gave h=
im=20
a
push.
      Not far from Beyer's factory, Didier Thuet, who owns a small heating
installation  business adopted the 35hour week for just the same reason. "I=
t
was an  opportunity to try something," he said.
      Thuet's business is seasonal. There is little work at all from March =
to
May. So he  offered his employees a shorter workweek during those months in
exchange for a  longer one during peak business periods. They also got an
additional six to eight  days off. All six of the employees agreed to a sal=
ary
freeze until the year was over  and the company could see how much money it
made.
      But both Thuet and Beyer have their doubts about whether the law will
work  everywhere.
      And there are complaints from the supposed beneficiaries of the new=
=20
jobs.
At  Beyer, Sarah Charro, who at 26 had a series of temporary jobs, was hire=
d
because  of the reorganization, but she has little good to say about it. Sh=
e
says the  atmosphere in the factory is tense.
      "I feel in some ways like we went backward," Ms. Charro said. "We are
working  only 35 hours, but they are trying to push a lot into those hours
push, push,  push. We are all stressed out."
      Thuet's new employee, Christoffe Foulon, says the 35hour week is grea=
t=20
if
he  does not lose any money. But in truth, he would rather work more and ea=
rn
more.  He says few of his friends seem to envy him. Instead, he says, most=
=20
give
him a  hard time. "They treat me like I'm lazy," he said.

=0F"Latin American markets rally,=0F" Simon Romero, New York Times

SAO PAULO, Brazil  Buoyed by fresh inflows of overseas investment money, st=
ock
markets in Latin America are staging a rally  that could presage a return t=
o
economic growth in many of the region's  countries next year.

 Over the last few weeks, indexes like the Bovespa on the Sao Paulo  stock
exchange, Latin America's largest stock market, have soared to a  sixmonth
high. In Mexico, Latin America's second-largest country, the  bolsa index
reached a threemonth high. On the coattails of these  markets, stocks in
Argentina, Chile and Colombia registered healthy  gains.

 Much of the rally has been fueled by relief over potential interest rate
increases in the United States, as recent economic reports have led  some
investors to believe that only one increase in rates, instead of  several, =
is
likely in coming months. Lower interest rates in the United  States, Latin
America's biggest source of investment, translates into  more money availab=
le
for purchases of stocks in the region.

  However, a growing consensus that Latin America is positioned for a  revi=
val
of economic growth next year is also encouraging investors to  increase the=
ir
stock holdings.

  The recovery of some commodities prices, healthy demand for Latin  Americ=
an
exports in rich industrialized nations and political and  economic=20
developments
in countries like Mexico have led analysts such  as Geoffrey Dennis of Salo=
mon
Smith Barney to predict 3.2 percent  growth for the region as a whole next
year, compared with fourtenths  of a 1 percent contraction in 1999.

  ``Investors are lifting the veil from a period in which Latin America was
oversold,'' said Edmar Bacha, the New Yorkbased strategist for Banco  BBA
Creditanstalt. ``What they're seeing, minus the threat of higher  Fed rates=
,=20
is
a region looking a lot better next year than this year.''

  One of the best examples of this newfound optimism is Chile, a nation  th=
at
was hit hard by the economic crisis suffered by some of its Pacific  Rim
trading partners.

  Helped by lower domestic interest rates and a recovery in the price of
copper, Chile's economy is expected to grow 5.5 percent in 2000,  compared=
=20
with
a shrinkage of half a percent this year. And coming  presidential elections=
=20
are
not viewed as risky, since the two leading  candidates are pledging a simil=
ar
blend of centrist economic policies,  said Neil Dougall, an economist with
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson.

  In Mexico, politics is also generating optimism over the economy with
concern easing over the possibility of disruption resulting from primary
presidential elections. And strong growth in the United States, Mexico's  m=
ain
export market, contributes to positive sentiment over the country's  econom=
y,
which is increasingly viewed by economists as more linked to  its northern
neighbors than to the rest of Latin America.
  Yet while prospects look better in countries like Chile and Mexico, it is=
 =20
in
Brazil, Latin America's biggest economy, where most attention is  focused. =
So
perhaps it is no small wonder that the rally lifting most Latin  markets is
nowhere as dramatic as it is here.

  Two weeks ago, Brazil's currency, the real, was getting hammered as
speculators who had been betting on weakness pushed the real beyond  two to=
=20
the
dollar for the first time in eight months. As alarm grew over  the real's
decline, Brazil successfully sought greater flexibility to defend  the=20
currency
by using money from the International Monetary Fund,  which has oversight o=
ver
such matters because it is financing an  economic aid package to the countr=
y.
The real began to strengthen.

  ``All of a sudden there was much less pressure on the bank to raise  rate=

*************3. JAPAN ECHO Vol. 26, No. 1, February 1999
Getting to the Bottom of Japan's Economic Blues
KOJIMA Akira
        The Japanese economy found itself pushed to the edge of a precipice=
 in
1998 by a rapid surge of deflationary pressure. Obuchi Keizo, who succeeded
Hashimoto Ryutaro as prime minister at the end of July, proclaimed his new
administration an "economic revitalization cabinet," and policy at least
shifted in the right direction, however belatedly. The government secured
passage for legislation setting aside a huge volume of public funds to deal
with the stricken financial sector, and it approved fiscal outlays on an
unprecedented scale to stimulate demand. Thanks to these measures, the econ=
omy
managed to stop just short of the precipice.
        During 1999 the economy should enjoy a bit of a breather as the=20
effects
of the heavy dose of government stimulus take hold. But it will be no more=
=20
than
a breather, and it will be essential for financial institutions to take
advantage of this temporary respite to restructure their operations and for
business corporations to undertake serious efforts to strengthen themselves=
.=20
If
they fail to do so, the economy is liable to slip back into critical condit=
ion
as soon as the effects of the stimulus have worn off. This year will be a
decisive one, representing as it does the last chance of the twentieth cent=
ury
for the Japanese economy to be revitalized.
        After achieving a recovery labeled miraculous in the years after Wo=
rld
War II, our country's economy suddenly lost its momentum in the final decad=
e=20
of
the century. The downturn started in 1991, and from 1992 through 1994 the
growth rate was close to zero. In 1995 and 1996 the economy managed to expa=
nd
by 2%-3%, but then in fiscal 1997 (April 1997 to March 1998) it contracted =
by
0.7%. And the growth rate for fiscal 1998 is being estimated at around -2%.
This will be the first time in the postwar period that the economy has=20
recorded
negative growth for two years in a row. It will also mean that the average
growth rate from 1992 through 1998 will fall to 0.7%, dipping below the 1%
mark.
        Why did the economy suddenly lose its steam? The main causes are th=
e
speculative bubbles of the late 1980s and the policy blunders following the=
ir
bursting starting in 1990. Over the course of history, countries around the
world have experienced economic bubbles. Where they differ is in the skill =
of
their policies to deal with the aftermath. Japan's record on this score has
clearly been a string of failures. Until 1998 the authorities did virtually
nothing to promote the clearing up of the large volume of loans that went b=
ad
after the collapse of the bubble economy. This huge overhang of nonperformi=
ng
assets in the financial sector acted as a drag on the economy as a whole,
preventing it from regaining its forward momentum. And as the recession=20
dragged
on, the bad-debt problem grew even greater in scale. The situation=20
deteriorated
to the point where a series of major financial institutions went bankrupt i=
n
November 1997, setting off an overall contraction of credit.
        Earlier in the year the government had implemented a set of
belt-tightening measures, including a hike of the consumption tax from 3% t=
o
5%, that produced a negative fiscal impulse on the order of \9 trillion. In
other words, 1997 was a year of powerful deflationary pushes from both the
monetary and fiscal sides of the macroeconomic picture. No economy could
withstand this sort of double punch without buckling.
        Particularly from November 1997 on, the economy was obviously heade=
d
down, but even so the government dallied in shifting its fiscal stance and =
in
dealing with the bad debts that were at the root of the financial deflation=
.
What set off the powerful deflationary contraction of credit was the first
occurrence of default in the interbank market in the postwar period in earl=
y
November. Despite the smallness of the amount defaulted, the market panicke=
d
because all its transactions were premised on the absolute impossibility of
default. Financial institutions became leery of extending credit to each=20
other,
and the interbank market ceased to function smoothly. Every institution tri=
ed
to build up its own liquidity. And financial institutions whose capital was
meager by comparison with the scale of their nonperforming loans found
themselves coming under a fierce attack in the stock market. As a result, t=
hey
moved to raise their capital adequacy ratios by cutting back on their=20
lending.!

        This set off a classic credit crunch.
LENDER OF FIRST RESORT
        When matters reach this sort of pass, the relaxation of monetary=20
policy
by the central bank fails to affect the real economy. Though the Bank of Ja=
pan
has adopted an extremely loose policy stance, actual financial conditions h=
ave
become severely tightened. This can be seen most clearly in the relationshi=
p
between the money supply and bank credit. Normally when the money supply (c=
ash
and bank deposits) expands, the volume of lending by banks grows accordingl=
y,
and financial conditions relax. But in the credit contraction that became
pronounced from the end of 1997 on, bank lending has shrunk in volume despi=
te
growth of the money supply.
        For example, if we look at the figures for the so-called city banks
(Japan's major money-center banks) in the 12-month period ending September
1998, we find that their deposits were up 5.3%, but their outstanding loans
decreased by 2.5%, or \4.5 trillion. And the ratio of loans to deposits fel=
l=20
by
a remarkable 8.7 percentage points over the same period. Banks were under
pressure to write off their bad loans, which they had been putting off doin=
g;
the capital crunch in the financial sector was accompanied by a credit crun=
ch
in the general economy.
        So what have the banks been doing with their increased deposits? Th=
ey
have been avoiding risk by investing them in government bonds, and as a res=
ult
the yield on the government's 10-year issues has fallen below 1%. This is a
first for Japan, of course, and in fact it is unprecedented in capital mark=
ets
around the world. The problem is that, even as government bond yields have=
=20
been
falling, the yield on the corporate bond issues of big businesses has been
rising. In other words, not only has it become harder for businesses to bor=
row
from banks, but it has also become harder for them to raise funds from the
capital market. Even so, major corporations have been raising some funds
through bond issues. But smaller firms that are not in a position to issue
their own bonds have felt the full brunt of banks' cutbacks in lending.
        If this situation were left untreated, the Japanese economy would h=
ave
no prospect of recovering. During the course of 1998, therefore, the Bank o=
f
Japan implemented large-scale purchases (via banks) of commercial paper, wh=
ich
are notes issued by corporations to cover their operating expenses. In effe=
ct
the central bank was stepping in to lend where regular banks would not. One
might even say that it became the lender not of last resort but of first
resort. In addition, other government-affiliated financial institutions hav=
e
been actively extending loans to companies and other firms.
        The root cause of the contraction in bank lending is the remaining=
=20
pile
of bad loans, which has still not been adequately dealt with. In order to
alleviate this problem, the government has come up with a massive \60 trill=
ion
package of public funding for the financial sector. But bank executives are
reluctant to make use of these public funds, fearing that if they do, they=
=20
will
be expected to take responsibility for the failure of their earlier lending
decisions. And under these circumstances the credit crunch appears certain =
to
continue, even if it becomes somewhat less serious in degree.
        The gravity of the bad-debt problem is apparent from the volume of =
the
asset value lost as a result of the collapse of the bubble economy. In the
period from 1991 through 1994 land prices fell \556 trillion, and from 1989
through 1992 stock prices dropped \490 trillion. In other words, the value =
of
assets in these two major categories plunged by over \1 quadrillion in the
post-bubble period, an amount equivalent to more than two years' gross=20
national
product. Since a large portion of the purchases of both land and stocks had
been financed by bank lending, the deflation in these asset values led=20
directly
to the emergence of huge amounts of bad loans.
STRUCTURAL FACTORS ADDING TO THE DRAG
        The principal causes of the Japanese economy's sudden loss of momen=
tum
in the 1990s thus appear to have been the policy failures in dealing with t=
he
aftermath of the bubble years, in connection both with the bad-debt problem=
=20
and
the handling of fiscal affairs. These were not the only causes, however. Ot=
her
factors, systemic and structural, account for probably 20% to 30% of the to=
tal
negative change.
        A number of problems may be cited in this connection: (1) Japan
completed the decades-long process of catching up with the West. (2) The
country was tardy in coping systematically with the forces of globalization=
=20
and
megacompetition that picked up strength following the end of the cold war. =
(3)
The Japanese population has been aging at a pace never experienced by any
country in the world, and this has heightened people's concerns about the
future. (4) The focus of technology has been shifting from manufacturing=20
toward
information, software, and services.
        The end of the catch-up process meant less scope for growth through=
=20
the
introduction of technologies and products from overseas, forcing Japan to r=
ely
on innovations of its own to achieve further economic expansion. Furthermor=
e,
it had to do so within the context of the world's highest average wage leve=
ls.
        Next, the advent of megacompetition meant the emergence of rivalry=
=20
from
the newly industrialized economies, many with wages only a tenth or a=20
fifteenth
of Japan's, placing Japanese businesses in a highly disadvantageous positio=
n.
        Population aging, meanwhile, is a process that has been going on in=
=20
all
the industrial nations, but in Japan's case it has been progressing at an
especially rapid clip. This has forced the country to scramble in order to=
=20
make
the required systemic adjustments in areas like pensions and employment. In
addition to the rise in longevity, there has been a sharp decline in the
birthrate, which has further accelerated the rise in the elderly share of t=
he
population. Early in the twenty-first century, the total number of Japanese=
 is
expected to start declining. In the 50 years following the end of World War=
=20
II,
the population grew by an average of about 1 million people a year, but in =
the
50 years to come it is estimated that it will decline on average by half a
million a year. This will mean a shrinking labor force, which will face an
increased burden in supporting the growing numbers of elderly, and it will=
=20
also
mean shrinking markets. Various systems, including pensions, taxes,=20
employment,
and wages, will have to be reformed fundamentally in order to keep them fro=
m
collapsing. Meanwhile, of course, the vitality of the economy will wane, an=
d
with it the capacity for economic growth. The outlook is bleak.
        Finally, the paradigm shift in technology will pose a major challen=
ge
for Japan in the period to come. During the twentieth century Japan has bee=
n
extraordinarily successful with its technology for standardized mass
production, which was the dominant paradigm of the century. Automobiles and
electric appliances are representative of the fields in which Japanese
manufacturers have won strong positions. But since the early 1980s, when
Japanese industry was seen by many people to be victorious, the focus in
high-value technology has been shifting away from standardized mass product=
ion
in the direction of knowledge-intensive and information-intensive areas, fr=
om
hardware to software, and from manufacturing to services.
        As globalization has progressed, capital, technology, and managemen=
t
know-how have been moved actively across national borders, and standardized
production was easily shifted to the newly industrialized economies. The=20
medium
for these transfers has been cross-border direct investment, which has grow=
n=20
by
leaps and bounds since the end of the cold war. We have entered an age in=
=20
which
comparative advantage in standard mass production can be imported. This
produces a tendency toward price leveling. In most cases the trend is a
downward one, with prices being drawn to the level of the low-wage countrie=
s.
And it makes it difficult for a high wage country like Japan to sustain hig=
h
value-added production.
THE PARADOX OF SUCCESS
        There are two ways out of this difficulty. One is to shift
manufacturing
operations overseas to take advantage of lower wage levels. The other is fo=
r
businesses to compete in nonprice areas by coming up with their own
technologies and products. Corporations that shift their operations offshor=
e
can continue to enjoy growth in their consolidated results on a global basi=
s,
but meanwhile they are promoting the hollowing out of the domestic
manufacturing sector. For Japan as a whole the second alternative, nonprice
competition, is more desirable, especially now that the goal of catching up
with the West has been accomplished. But in order to succeed at this endeav=
or,
it will be necessary to recast the whole set of systems that were designed =
for
the catch-up period. The new systems will have to shift their focus from th=
e
achievement of equality of results to support of those who take risks and
display creativity. The system of automatic wage hikes in line with increas=
ing
seniority will have to be overhauled, and the egalitarianism of the school
system will also have to be modified.
        Making such reforms will mean fundamentally changing the social val=
ues
to which we have become accustomed. Resistance is likely to be great. Peopl=
e
will be quick to agree with the need for reform in principle but will resis=
t
the particulars that affect their own areas of activity. Already over the p=
ast
decade we have witnessed many loud calls for reform, leading to numerous
reports and recommendations, but there has been little by way of
implementation.
        One reason for this lack of follow-through is the fantastic success
that
Japan enjoyed in the economic sphere for the previous several decades. Sinc=
e
the existing systems and practices were so successful for so long, they hav=
e
become quite hard to change. This is the "paradox of success" or "reward of
success" to which Peter Drucker refers.
        It may be possible for the Japanese economy to get out of its curre=
nt
hole by overcoming the credit crunch arising out of the bad-debt problem an=
d
correcting the earlier mistakes in fiscal policy. This, however, will amoun=
t=20
to
no more than the righting of earlier wrongs. In order for our economy and
society to demonstrate vigor and creatively produce new value and new
technologies in the century to come, we must overcome the "paradox of succe=
ss"
and remake our long-standing systems and practices. The lack of progress=20
toward
this goal is the source of our current sense of being at an impasse.
        The massive dose of financial and fiscal stimulus that the
government is
now administering should halt the severe downturn that started in November
1997, and in 1999 we can hope to see at least faint signs of a recovery. Bu=
t=20
it
is essential that this respite be used to achieve progress toward systemic
reform. Unless this is accomplished, the 1990s will be a "lost decade" for
Japan, and our economic outlook for the twenty-first century will be a gloo=
my
one.

I) The midterm

A voluntary take-home midterm will be available next week (11/17-23). Email me
if you would like to take it and I will email back an exam. You have 80 
minutes
to complete the exam from the start time you designate.  The grade 
distribution
of midterm exams will equal that of final exams, so it will not influence by
much your expected grade (although it may reduce the uncertainty).

II) Past midterm and final exam questions

A real mideterm has about 80 points worth of questions, a final exam has about
160
points worth of questions. This document is a compilation of questions from
past
exams, and is much longer than any single exam. Plausible midterm questions 
are
marked with a *. Many of the questions were relevant in a given year; thus, 
the
year of
the exam is sometimes included in [brackets].


Short Answer: True, False, or Uncertain, and Why? The grade you receive 
depends
solely on the quality of your explanation. If you are not sure of what the
question
assumes, simply state your own assumptions clearly, and answer based on these
assumptions.

* 1. [10] The US unemployment rate would decline rapidly if unemployment
insurance
were cut.

2. [10] The rate of growth of M1 and M2 have both been fairly rapid recently
(Assume
this sentence is true.) Thus, we can expect that the inflation rate will soon
increase
rapidly. [1991]

3. [10] In the late seventies the US had both high inflation and relatively
high
unemployment. Thus, the Phillips' curve theory is wrong, since it predicts 
that
inflation
and unemployment are negatively related.

4. [10] Recently Canada has informally maintained a fixed exchange rate with
the US.
(This sentence is true.) As long as they target exchange rates, monetary 
policy
will not
be effective in Canada. (You may want to refer to Canadian and US dollars as
C$'s
and US$'s in your answer.)

5. [10] If the Japanese would lower their interest rates to expand their
aggregate
demand, then Japanese purchases of US goods would increase. [Hint: Consider 
the
exchange rate.]

6. [10] "Why is our money ever less valuable? Perhaps it is simply that we 
have
inflation because we expect inflation, and we expect inflation because we've
had it."
(Robert M. Solow, Technology Review, Dec/Jan 1979: 31)

7. [10] The current U.S. Federal Government Budget Deficit (BD) is not a
problem in
the short run (i.e., this year). [1992]

8. [10] Fiscal policy is less effective in France than in the United States.
[Hint: Consider
differences both in the open-economy multiplier and the exchange rate regime.]

9. [10] Low-wage countries such Greece and Portugal will gain more from the
creation
on a common market than will high-wage countries such as Germany and Denmark.
[1993]

* . [10] True unemployment is above measured unemployment.

* 11. [10] We should not worry much about inflation.

* 12. [10] The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates, marginal savings

rates, and marginal propensity to import are all high.

* 13. [10] Budget deficits in a recession are a good thing.

* 14. [10] For each dollar of revenue lost to the government, capital gains 
tax
cuts are
less effective at spurring investment than are increases in the investment tax
credit.

* 15. [10] The federal government should increase spending on education.

* 16. [10] Unions are responsible for a significant fraction of U.S.
unemployment.
[1994]

17. [10] Free trade hurts American workers, but helps workers in low-wage
nations.

18. [10] It is good for the nation when monetary policy accommodates fiscal
policy.

* 19. [10] Frictional unemployment represents people rationally choosing to
search for
a job. Thus, no government policy is called for to address it.

* 20. [10] European unemployment rates and unionization rates are both above
U.S.
levels, proving unions cause unemployment. [1994]

21. [10] In class we assumed money demand depended on output and interest 
rates
(L
= kY - hi). In the IS-LM framework, when the demand for money (k) increases at
any
given level of output, output and interest rates will rise.

22. [10] A balanced budget rule (so long as it corrected for cyclical factors)
would be
a good thing.

23. [10] Increasing consumption increases output. (Hint: Is this a trick
question?)

24. [10] In an open economy, monetary policy is less effective than in a 
closed
economy.

* 25. [10] No policy can cost-effectively reduce the rate of long-term
unemployment.

26. [10] Because the stock market falls when output and employment rise, the
market
is not a good predictor of future output growth.

27. Japan will grow faster than Russia next year. [1995]

* 28. Japan will grow faster than Russia over the next 15 years. [1995]

29. Russian inflation will decline next year. [1995]

30. The creation of the EMU will reduce Italian long-term interest rates.
[1996]

31. The process of qualifying for the EMU has reduced French economic growth.
[1996]

[10] "A Booming Economy Made it All Much Easier: For the Shrinking Deficit,
Thank
the Economy." [New York Times, 1997]

[10] The recent actions of the Labour government concerning the Central Bank
should
lower expected inflation in the United Kingdom. [1997]

[10] The recent appreciation of the U.S. dollar is bad for Argentine. [1997]

[10] Ireland should join the European Monetary Union. [Hints: Ireland's 
economy
is
closely tied to Europe but most closely to the United Kingdom; Irish inflation
has
historically been above the EC average; the Irish economy has been growing
rapidly for
several years and is likely approaching the output level associated with the
non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment; and the Irish currency has
been near
the top of its permissible band of fluctuation against other European
countries.] [1997]

[10] "Investors give East Europe a miss: Problems with legal system, taxes,
crime and
corruption deter foreign funds." [Financial Times, 1997]

[10] The EMU should include Italy. [1997]

[10] The multiplier is higher when marginal tax rates, marginal savings rates,
the
marginal propensity to import are all low and the investment accelerator is
high.

* [10] The government should subsidize private savings.

* [10] The capital gains tax should cut, but only if it is reformed.

* [10] The government should subsidize student loans for college.

Longer answers

32. [26] In 1990 the strange and wonderful nation of Bezerkly could best be
modelled
with the following one-sector model of a closed economy:

Y = C + I + G
C = C0 + c Y = 50 + .8 Y
I = I0 + fY = 50 + .1 Y
G = G0 = 100

This model differs from the standard textbook model because when sales 
increase
by
$1, Bezerk investors see that they need new factories, and investment 
increases
by $f,
where the parameter f is between zero and one.

a) [8] Derive the government spending multiplier in this model either
symbolically or
numerically. Compare it to multiplier when f = 0. (Recall that if f= 0, then
the multiplier
in this model dY/dG = 1/(1-b) = 1/(1-.8) =

5. To help you with your arithmetic, Y = 2000 in the example above.)

b) [8] Explain in words the intuition behind the comparison of the two
multipliers.

c) [10] What happens to output if G0 falls to 90? What happens to national
savings?
Show national savings (S - gov't deficit)=I after the shock.

33. [20] As time passed the Telegraph was invented and brought news from the
outside world about the wonderful concept of money. Soon thereafter money is
introduced into the Bezerker economy, undoubtedly by some non-politically
correct
dean or economist.

In addition, repetitive drumming in by microeconomics, finance, accounting and
macroeconomics professors convinces managers to pay attention to interest 
rates
when
choosing how much to invest. Now the nation is best modelled with the 
following
IS-LM model of a closed economy:

C = C0 + cY = 50 + .8 Y
I = I0 + fY - bi = 50 + .1 Y - i
G = G0 = 100
L = kY - hi = Y - 10i Money demand
M/P = 1800 Money supply

A. Derive the formulae for the IS curve and the LM curves. (Don't use numbers
for this
question.)

B. What are the equilibrium levels of income and interest rate? (Do use 
numbers
for this
question.)

34. [30] While in class we focussed on fixed vs. flexible exchange rates, many
nations
have intermediate cases. For example, some nations have band, where rates are
fixed
plus or minus some percent. For example, a nation may fix its rates at 10 
pesos
per
dollar plus or minus 4 percent, thus fixing between 9.6 and 10.4 pesos per
dollar. In
other cases the fixed rate has a crawl built into it: We fix at 10 pesos to 
the
dollar,
depreciating 1 percent per month. Other nations combine the two: a band each
month,
with built-in depreciation over time. What are the advantages and 
disadvantages
of
these hybrid systems compared to pure fixed rates?

[30] After evaluating all other relevant arguments for and against adoption of
a fixed
currency, policymakers in the small open economy of Haasland are still
undecided. The
costs seem to exactly equal the benefits. The last piece of information they
are to
consider is that Haasland has historically been subject to more shocks of
consumer and
investor confidence than supply or price shocks. Given this fact and the 
desire
of
Haasland policymakers to stabilize output, what exchange rate policy would you
recommend? [Hint: Make reference to IS-LM diagrams in which you show the 
effect
on output and interest rates of a negative shock to the IS curve (consumer or
investor
confidence) and a negative shock to the LM curve (supply or price shock) under
both
fixed and floating exchange rates.]

[30] In 1984, the small open economy of New Zealand had a policy of 
maintaining
a
fixed exchange rate. Suddenly, due to a political crisis, the risk premium for
investment
in New Zealand increased dramatically. Policymakers were left with two 
options:
1)
raise interest rates or 2) devalue the currency. Recommend a response based on
an
analysis of the impact of these policies on output, interest rates and
inflation, making
reference to an IS-LM diagram. [Hint: Would it matter where output was 
relative
to
Y*, the output level associated with the non-accelerating inflation level of
unemployment?]

Please find section 3 notes attached. I did not get to review the
questions on Ghana, Ireland and Brazil, so I will try to cover those
case studies next week.  This means that you should read those special
survey sections from the Financial Times (I also attached those).

Five of us met this past Tuesday for the first time, and it worked out
really well.  We are going to do it again the same time and place:

Time: Tuesday (11/9) 6-8pm

Place: BofA building (corner of Kearny and CA) 30th floor (Aaron's office)
415-263-3320 if you get lost.



Last time we reviewed the Econ class notes and discussed the homework.  I
was thinking this week we could do that for one hour, and then discuss the
Accounting Case.

Please e-mail ME if you are planning on attending so we can get you through
the wall of security at Aaron's office and get you fed.  (We order in pizza
and will rotate who pays)

Hi All,

We are already down a quarter of the Macro course and you'd have got
a sense of the class, weekend sections and the homework etc.

As the class rep, I would like to solicit your feedback/comments to
shape/improve the remainder of this course.

In particular, send me(kannan@haas) or Cathy(langridg@haas) your thoughts on

1. Class topics/discussions, participation issues...
2. Homework - whether would you like it to be assessed?
3. What would you like to see in the sections, how should it be done?
4. Class notes/handouts, newspaper articles...
5. Some of you had expressed concern over broad nature of class discussions
and how to crystallize this for the final exam? Anymore issues on the Final?
6. Whether you would like a mid-term?
7. Coverage of sample exam. questions during the section....
8. Final exam review sessions?

and/or anything else that you feel needs to be addressed.

Thanks
Suresh

P.S To clear the air, I am NOT going to enforce late fee for the Monday
section. Since it was agreed upon by the class, and it is for charity,
I would like this to be voluntary. ;-))

In my sniffling, sneezing, coughing, stuffy head, fever state I did not
realize that Aaron only sent the Germany info to me.  So here it is...enjoy!

Kelly, I'll drop off my FTs on the way to the final since I won't be able to
attend your party after.  You will need to take them out of the rubberband
before you recycle them!

See you guys tomorrow...Good Luck!

These are the notes from Saturday's section. Note, diagrams in the Word
6 version will not appear correctly.  Congratulations to those of you
who could deal with 5 hours of macro on saturday!

I am also attaching an article from the Wall Street Journal on Argentina
which does a better job integrating the idea of the risk premium on
policy, as I discussed in section.

For those who attended section I promised to clarify whether the LM
needed to shift if a country on fixed exchange rates chose to devalue
when suddenly facing a higher risk premium.

Because of the risk premium and the outflow of capital at the prevailing
interest rate, r*, the absence of any central bank action combined with
allowing the exchange rate to float, automatically lowers the exchange
rate.  So no shift of the LM curve is required.

Basically the demand for assets denominated in the currency has declined
thereby putting downward pressure on the currency. The decision to float
the exchange rate "accomodates" this decline in demand and the central
bank does not need to increase money supply to cause the devaluation, it
happens on its own.

Of course, the new exchange rate should be pegged at the level where
r=r* + theta.  Now in the future, the central bank will do whatever is
required to keep the exchange rate at the new level.

For those who don't follow this, don't worry it is a fairly technical
point, but I wanted to make sure I clarified it.

Dear class,

1. Popular acclimation has requested that we move macro the exam to Thursday
12/16. If you are one of the 3 people who prefered Wednesday, please contact 
me
and we will arrange an opportunity for you to take the exam Wednesday.
        BA201B Thursday, 12/16 6-9:30 in C210 & C220

For your information, the exam for BA202A will be Monday, 12/13 6-9:30 in C135
& C220,

Bhash and I have already ordered pizza and beer for the grading festivities on
Friday 12/17.  (Actually, cappucinno's, but I thought you'd appreciate the
imagery of cheerful--albeit inaccurate--graders more.)

2. Also, classmates have suggested a number of web sites, and links have been
added to the class site. Be sure to understand the environmental and labor
rights critiques of the WTO.  We do not have time to discuss them in class, 
and
most business press presents largely the advantages of free trade.

See you soon,
- David

Q1: What are the main reasons for having a common currency Euro for the  EU?

        Transactions of money and trade will less expensive because currency
exchange cost will disappear.  Saves the costs of hedging exchange rate risks
(some monetary, others due to the drain on managerial attention) or the risks
of not heding fixed but adjustable rates.  Makes price differences more
transparent across borders, which may increase trade.  Economists do not fully
understand why, but beyond the measurable effects of the effects I just
mentioned, a common currency increases trade even more than these slightly
lower transaction costs can explain.
        The process of qualifying for unification also required lower 
inflation
and deficits, which many economists and politicians desired.
        The main arguments for monetary unifications were political, not
economic, having to do with integrating Western Europe.

Q2: Beside losing its monetary authority, what are the reasons that the UK 
does
not want to join the Euro? I believe the Government has a different opinion
than the public. What are these arguments?

As you note, the economic reason is fear of losing control over domestic
monetary policy.  As with the decision to join, the UK's decision not to join
was largely political, choosing NOT to unify as rapidly with Europe on 
monetary
and lots of other matters (social charter that may regulate working 
conditions,
etc.).

Q3: In my notes, I wrote "You don't get rich by exporting -- you get rich in
the short run by importing." What do you mean?

I said that unclearly.  I should have said, "You do not raise your standard of
living by exporting; you raise it by importing."  At the same time, exports 
are
the price of imports, so you raise your grandkids' standard of living by
exporting intsead of borrowing to pay for the imports.  (Unless the imports 
are
high-value investment goods...)

Q4: I also wrote in my notes: "Trade deficits and exchange rates can't be used
to describe a country's prosperity."  If trade deficits and exch. rates can't
be used to describe prosperity, what is the best measure? At first GDP comes 
to
mind, but in my day 2 notes, there are all sorts of reasons why GDP isn't a
good measure, the most poignant one being: "2 countries have the same GDP, but
one country has twice as many people -- this country has lower per capita GDP,
and is poorer than the first country."
        CRUX: is per capita GDP a good measure of prosperity?

Per capita is a pretty good measure of prosperity and living standards.  The
list we gave are all the components of "the good life" it leaves out.  On
average, rich nations have higher life expectancy, etc., so GDP per capita is
not too misleading, but it clearly can be (as we pointed out).  Thus, no 
single
measure suffices, and a combination of measures can be useful.

two renowned California enterprises -- multimedia and entertainment.
 But then both industries started complaining of a tight labor market and
stiff competition from outside the state. As a result, a raft of companies,
including Seagram Co.'s Universal Studios, Walt Disney Co. and USWeb/CKS
Corp., have been the beneficiaries of $9 million from the Employment
Training Panel. The eight-member board metes out about $100 million
annually to attract and retain businesses and jobs by improving workers'
skills.
 And while California clearly has an interest in promoting a healthy
climate for business -- including an able work force -- some are
questioning whether multimedia and entertainment are really the kind of
struggling industries that couldn't make it without state assistance.
 The funds doled out by the Training Panel amount to "corporate welfare,"
says Naomi Lopez, a policy analyst at the Pacific Research Institute, a
free-market-oriented think tank in San Francisco. And "just because there's
a labor shortage in entertainment and multimedia doesn't mean we need to be
using government resources to alleviate {it}."
 According to Brady Bevis, director of San Francisco's Bay Area Multimedia
Partnership, that's exactly what the Training Panel should be doing to
ensure the health of the state's economy. "These industries and jobs can go
anywhere," she adds, noting they are already moving to Canada, India and 
Japan.
 Training Panel funds come from a special tax collected from businesses,
which amount to a maximum of about $7 per employee. Businesses or training
agencies apply to the panel to underwrite their training programs, and can
be reimbursed for them after employees complete the training and stay with
their jobs for 90 days. The bulk of panel funds -- between 60% and 70% --
go to manufacturers.
 Kathleen Milnes, a senior vice president at the Entertainment Industry
Development Corp. in Los Angeles, estimates that entertainment companies
fork over about $4 million annually to the panel fund, but until recently
hadn't benefited from it. "We were subsidizing other industries," she says.
 So in 1996 Ms. Milnes's and Ms. Bevis's organizations prompted the
Training Panel's venture into the celluloid and digital realms. The two
economic-development nonprofits devised a program called SkillsNet, which
aims to keep cutting-edge, high-paying entertainment and multimedia jobs in
the state. The effort has received about $653,000 from the panel to study
which skills companies are looking for, set up a Web page, and help firms
tap into state training funds, among other things. Later this month,
SkillsNet plans to unveil a new report on the post-production industry,
plus an online posting of internships.
 But misgivings about the panel's new focus are being unveiled as well.
 Though he hasn't looked at the impact of state training dollars spent on
multimedia and entertainment companies, Richard W. Moore, a management
professor at California State University-Northridge, says that panel funds
are most effective when used as an incentive for employers who typically
"underinvest" in training. In contrast, entertainment and multimedia
companies "tend to invest in training anyway," says Prof. Moore, who was
commissioned by the panel to assess its effectiveness. He released reports
in 1994 and 1995; his next study is set to come out later this summer.
 In general, he says, the panel "works." Based on his 1995 report, Prof.
Moore found that the training provided by panel funds meant that after two
years, employees who received retraining increased their salary by $4,910,
and new hires increased theirs by $6,038. Considering the panel spends only
about $1,500 a participant, he says that's a healthy payoff.
 Still, Sen. Patrick Johnston, the Stockton Democrat who wrote the
legislation that created the Employment Training Panel in 1982, is
attempting to reel in the agency through Senate Bill 43. Among other
things, the bill, which has already passed the Senate, reduces the panel
from a grant-making agency to an advisory commission to the state
Employment Development Department.
 While the panel has "helped some workers and boosted some businesses that
are important to the California economy," in other instances, it has made
less than stellar funding decisions, Sen. Johnston says, pointing to funds
given to hotels, law firms and other service industries that "clearly
weren't going anywhere." But he believes that the agency's focus on
multimedia and entertainment will prove to be "an effective use of state
funds."
 During the past three years, the panel has awarded $8.9 million for
retraining about 5,000 workers and training 320 new hires on the latest
computer systems, software, and techniques in the multimedia and
entertainment fields. For example, state records show that Universal
Studios was granted $1.1 million last year to retrain 1,423 employees in
management and computer skills. And Video Symphony Entertraining Inc. in
Los Angeles, received $1.4 million to retrain workers from companies
including Walt Disney on techniques such as video editing and digital
animation.
 The entertainment and multimedia industries need the funds, says Charles
Lundberg, the panel's marketing director, because "competition keeps
getting tougher and the software and hardware keeps getting upgraded."
 Indeed, Paul Sidlo, chief executive of REZN8 Productions Inc., which does
everything from Web design to visual effects for film and television, says
his Los Angeles firm has lost out to Canadian companies on a handful of
contracts because they underbid him by nearly 40% -- thanks to government
subsidies. Given that, the 3-D animation training that 15 of his employees
received last year through funding from the state -- which he estimates was
worth about $40,000 in instruction costs and employees' time -- went a long
way toward reducing the $700,000 he spends annually on retraining workers.
 The training subsidy, he says, "really helped."


My comments:
 Trainin funds are most useful it they go to folks who would not pay for
the training themselves; perhaps due to difficulties borrowing.  Also, if
the skills are useful at many employers, no single employer wants to pay
for the skills that workers walk away with to competitors.
 Do you think the multimedia training subsidies meets these critera?  If
not, how could one target the training better?

I have attached a Word97 version and a Word95 version of my notes from
Saturday.  Since the notes have charts I think these may not come out
correctly on Word95 and I'm not sure how well the web page will show it
either when Prof Levine puts it up.

It is just an exciting time to be taking macroeconomics...

I) Be sure to follow the rise in interest rates in UK, ECB, and US.  We
will be discussing the pros & cons of each region's rise.  Try to decide if
the ECB or the FT editorials (today pp. 12 & 13) are correct on the need
for the ECB rate increase.

II) You might also glance at articles on falling real estate prices in
Japan (p. 4), and the article on Daewoo's bankruptcy (p. 12).

III) Yesterday's FT had a long editorial on markets for the inputs into
global warming (Thurs. 11/4, p. 14).  What are the pros and cons of markets
for controlling externalities of this global sort?

IV) Hint: A typical set of exam questions might be...
Consider one of the following nations that have had special sections in the
FT this term: Ireland, Brazil or Ghana.
1. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in
GDP for this nation?
2. What short-run fiscal or monetary policies are appropriate?
3. What is are 1 or 2 of the most serious threats to short-run growth in
GDP for this nation?
4. What longer-term policies are appropriate?

These are just the sections of this week, and I do not promise to give a
large selection of nations (although I will give > 1 unless I choose Japan,
Russia, or the EC).

Srikanth Hari sent the following BusinessWeek ANALYSIS & COMMENTARY I thought
others might want to read...


Software: A New Calculus for the New Economy
How reclassifying it as an investment boosts growth

The U.S. truly has seen the birth of a New Economy over the past several 
years.
That's one way to read the results of a comprehensive revision of historical
data on the gross domestic product released on Oct. 28 by the Commerce Dept.'s
Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The most stunning data in the report are about the acceleration of 
productivity
in the 1990s. Official revisions of productivity data, incorporating the 
latest
output figures from Commerce, won't be released by the Labor Dept. until Nov.
12. But a BUSINESS WEEK analysis of the new data from the Commerce Dept. shows
that nonfarm business productivity growth in this decade will likely be 
revised
upward, to roughly 2% a year, from 1.4%. Productivity growth will be boosted
for the 1980s as well, but not by as much (chart).

What's even more striking is the upward revision in productivity growth for 
the
last three years, from 1.9% to a stunning 2.6% rate. That explains how the 
U.S.
has been able to grow at a 4.2% rate over that stretch without creating
inflationary pressures.

KEEPS ON TICKING. While the rate of increase in economic output in the 1990s
isn't as impressive as the growth in productivity, it is not as low as the old
statistics indicated. From 1990 through 1998, the Commerce Dept. statisticians
say, the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1%--about even with the 1980s
growth rate of 3.2%. And, the report confirms what everyone senses: Growth has
accelerated recently. Commerce revised the economy's growth rate for 1996-98
upward to an average of 4.2% from a previously reported 3.8%.

By comparison, annual average GDP growth for the entire 40-year span covered 
by
the revisions was pushed upward to 3.4% from 3.2%. The implication of the
revisions: The U.S. economy may now be able to sustain a higher rate of growth
without inflation than was previously believed.

The Commerce Dept. now says that the GDP last year was $8.76 trillion, which 
is
about $250 billion--or 3%--higher than previously believed. A new calculus for
software investments accounted for about two-thirds of the upward revision in
GDP. And since software sales are growing far faster than the economy as a
whole, adding them into the GDP raises the economy's official growth rate--and
will likely continue doing so for years to come.

Indeed, the biggest factor in the Commerce Dept.'s revisions is the new way of
accounting for software, the poster product of the New Economy. The government
now treats software purchases by business and government as investments, which
are part of GDP. Until now, the only software sales that counted toward GDP
were sales to consumers and the sale of software that came bundled with
computers and was included in the computer's purchase price. Now all software
sales are factored into the GDP figures.

The new treatment of software isn't just some statistical trick. Until now,
software spending by business and government was considered an expense, and
expenses are left out of GDP to avoid double-counting. For instance, it would
be double-counting to list the steel that goes into a car as part of GDP and
count the car, too.

But software is not consumed in the production of new goods and services. And
the government is acknowledging now that software shouldn't be considered an
expense such as steel or stationery. It's being reclassified as an investment,
like a machine tool, in recognition that it has a useful life of at least a
year.

PIGGY-BANK BLOAT. By recognizing software as an investment instead of an
expense, the Commerce Dept. also increases the national savings rate. Savings
are the mirror image of investment. While the national savings rate was 
revised
downward for 1959-73, it was revised upward for the years since. The biggest
revision was for the most recent year covered: 1998. The government now says
that total national savings were 18.8% of gross national product last year, a
jump of 1.5 percentage points from the previous calculation. Of that increase,
fully 90% was accounted for by the government's recognition of business and
government software purchases as an investment.

The Commerce Dept. also rejiggered the composition of the national savings
accounts, raising personal savings while lowering government savings by an
equal amount. That's because of a new way of accounting for government pension
plans, contributions to which are now considered a form of personal rather 
than
governmental savings.

The reshuffling means that the personal savings rate is now calculated as 3.7%
for 1998 instead of a previously reported 0.5%. The new methodology will
undoubtedly turn the current personal savings rate from negative to positive.
But since the government's savings fell by a corresponding amount, the
reshuffling had no impact on the overall national savings rate. And the
downward trend in personal savings is still in place. By the new measure, the
personal savings rate declined from 10.9% in 1982 to 3.7% last year, instead 
of
from 9% to 0.5% as had been previously reported.

KINDER HINDSIGHT. The GDP revisions were wide-ranging and included hundreds of
large and small tweaks. For instance, the government is now using a better way
to measure the value of banking services such as automated teller machines and
electronic funds transfers. That increases the sector's official output and
productivity. Also, new inflation measures developed by the Labor Dept. are
being incorporated all the way back to 1978, not just since 1995.

One footnote: The government now says the recession of 1990-91 was milder than
previously thought. From its peak in the second quarter of 1990 to its trough
in the first quarter of 1991, GDP fell 1.8%. The old figure was a 2.7% drop.

The Commerce Dept.'s rewrite of economic history doesn't mean that the Federal
Reserve can afford to be any less vigilant about inflation. Regardless of the
official growth rate, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has to keep his eye on the
same warning signs: tight job markets, busy factories, rising commodity 
prices.
The real significance is that government statistics are finally reflecting the
reality of the high-growth, high-productivity, low-inflation New Economy.

By Peter Coy in Washington


My comments:
        The article is a bit unclear on whether software was ever counted.  
The
key point is that the value of software not yet depreciated is a percent or 
2of
GDP.  Thus, GDP is a few % larger than the old accounting system that expensed
all software immediately.  Consider your own desktop: What % of your salary is
the market value of the software you have on the machine?  (Not the original
cost, as Word95 has a very low market cost, even if it was $500 4 years ago.)

Here are some recent questions I've gotten from your classmates and my
answers to them.

Basically, this is what the country needs to come up with to balance its
Current account deficit.  Suppose everything is in balance but then a
foreign exporter like Boeing sells a plane to Argentina but decides not
to keep its pesos in Argentina in a bank account or by reinvesting it in
the economy but instead to convert its proceeds into dollars.  Now
unless an equivalent amount of pesos is invested by some other
foreigners in Argentina (converting their dollars into Pesos), the
currency board will have to sell dollars to Boeing in exchange for pesos
and decrease the supply of pesos in the economy and reduce its foreign
reserves.

Now think of millions of transactions going on.  If on balance,
argentina has to use its foreign reserves to balance its current account
it will start to deplete them.  At some point it would either have to
devalue (to make it more expensive for Boeing to sell pesos for dollars)
or effectively raise interest rates to very high levels in order to
attract investment. Now, with a fixed exchange rate Argentina cannot
devalue.  so it must raise interest rates which would further weaken the
economy.

One solution is to lower its budget deficit.  This decreases the
country's total borrowing needs and implies that interest rates will
decline helping spur domestic investment.  This also helps to restore
foreign investors' confidence.  This should lower the risk premium and
bring down interest rates more.


 >In terms of what shifts the IS-LM curve, are these things such as:
> a. China's potential entry into WTO which would open up the market to 
increased
> foreign investment thus, increasing competition which would result in 
increased
> consumption (lower prices) and unltimately a shifting of the IS curve 
because

This is really too indirect and long-term, you really want something
that directly
changes government spending or some sudden decision to change
consumption or investment behavior in order to shift the IS curve.  It
would be more like Japan's decision to stimulate the economy through
more government spending.  Or say Brazil lowering pension payments
thereby shifting the IS to the left.  Or how countries are suddenly
forced to invest to counter Y2K

> In the book on p. 193, it says "expansionary fiscal policy abroad reduces 
investment."
> Not clear here.

This assumes that the foreign countries have a big effect on world
savings (if not there is no effect).  In this case if they spend more
they essentially reduce the amount of funds available to everyone else
to borrow.  This drives up the world interest rate which lowers
investment since the costs of investment is now higher (I is a function
of r)

> P.194 on chart: why doesn't r* go up?

This is because in a small open economy, the interest rate is equal to
the world interest rate which is fixed.  The country is too small to
affect r.  The idea is exactly the same as in micro when we say that
firms are price takers.  here the price is r.


> In Japan, how does 0% r get rid of deflation?


Think of it simply as increasing the money supply.  In the classical
model (see p154-158).  A higher M results in higher prices.  This is the
opposite of deflation where prices fall.

Marcello Fontana sent an article from this week's BusinessWeek on an 
apparently
succesful policy to promote growth.

ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT
'Bribe' Third World Parents to Keep Their Kids in School
GARY S. BECKER

        Many well-meaning Americans, including college students and religious
organizations, have attacked Nike Inc. and other companies accused of
using child labor in their overseas plants in poor nations. I agree that
something should be done to save the children from dismal long-term
economic prospects. However, effective policies must recognize that the
fundamental cause of child labor is poverty, not greedy foreign and
domestic employers. To combat the effects of poverty, poor mothers
should be ''bribed'' to keep their children in school longer.

        Really poor families in Brazil, Mexico, Zaire, India, and many other
nations put their children to work because their meager earnings help
provide basic food and medicine for themselves and younger siblings.
Although parents may recognize that schooling would improve their
children's marketable labor skills later in life, they cannot afford the
''luxury'' of taking them out of the labor market. In essence, child
labor is the result of a conflict between short-term parental economic
interests and the long-term interests of the children.

        Adequate economic growth always eliminates child labor even without
laws

against it. But poor nations needn't wait until they grow richer. There
are short-term solutions. Many nations have compulsory schooling laws up
to age 15 or so, but they are often hard to enforce, especially in rural
areas and poor sections of large cities. Families who want their
children to work simply do not send them to school, or the children have
very high absenteeism rates. Officials are reluctant to punish parents
of working children, perhaps because they recognize that the problem is
not selfishness but poverty.

        SHARE THE BURDEN. I propose a better way: Give parents a financial
incentive to keep their children in school longer. Poor mothers should
be paid if schools certify that their children attend classes regularly.
Parents would be strongly motivated to send their children to
school--even when the children do not want to go--if these payments were
not much below what the children could earn. Most poor parents would
happily continue.

        [A few sentences were cut here.  I think they describe Progresa 
program
in Mexico.  I think this program pays a few dozen dollars a month to families
that keep kids in school and immunized.]
Most poor Mexican families earn only about $100 a
month. That large a percentage increase should have a noticeable effect
on their behavior.

        Poor families in less developed nations whose children do go to school
are likely to withdraw their daughters when they become teenagers. This
tends to perpetuate economic inequalities, since the children of women
who receive little schooling also tend to be badly educated. Progresa
tries to combat this tendency to favor education of older sons by paying
a little more to families that keep teenage daughters enrolled.

        NARROW THE GAP. This pioneering Mexican approach appears to be highly
successful. An evaluation prepared for an October economics conference
in Chile shows that after only a couple of years, Progresa significantly
raised the schooling of children in very poor Mexican families. It has
also narrowed the education gap between girls and boys and reduced the
labor force participation of boys.

        Of course, governments need to find the tax revenue to finance
programs
like Progresa. A good start would be to recognize that Mexico and many
other less developed nations typically spend disproportionately on
universities and other education of their elites. Redistributing some of
this spending to the poor would both reduce inequality and stimulate
faster economic growth. Widespread basic education is more effective in
promoting economic development than generous subsidies to the richer
students who attend universities.

        Child-labor critics could spend their time more fruitfully by
attacking
not the overseas employment policies of multinationals but the social
policies of governments in poor nations that are really responsible for
the prevalence of child labor there. These governments, and perhaps
international organizations such as the World Bank, should follow
Mexico's example and introduce programs that pay poor mothers to keep
their teenage and younger sons and daughters in school and out of the
labor force.

>From BusinessWeek in 1997   http://www.businessweek.com/1997/30/b353757.htm
COMMENTARY: IN THE NEW ECONOMY, THE OLD RULES STILL LIVE

            These are tough times for traditional inflation theory. A
soaring U.S. economy,
            fueled by the forces of globalization and technology, has
pushed joblessness
            down to levels not seen in decades. But consumer inflation
remains tame, and
            producer prices are actually falling. Convinced that the New
Economy can
            continue along this course, investors have bid the stock market
to new highs.

            But there's a more classical view of the economy that still
should be heeded.
            Virtually all mainstream economists say it's too early to scrap
economic theories
            that for decades have reliably predicted inflation. Ignoring
these basics is
            especially risky in a high-flying financial climate that is
sensitive to Federal
            Reserve policy decisions.

            INFLATION AND JOBS. First, a review of the Econ 101 lectures
you may
            have slept through. The topic: Phillips curve theory and the
concept of NAIRU, a
            clunky acronym for ''non-accelerating-inflation rate of
unemployment.'' Together,
            these relate joblessness and inflation--NAIRU being the jobless
rate at which
            inflation is stable. The Phillips curve/NAIRU model suggests
that inflation is
            caused by excess demand--demand beyond what available workers and
            machines can satisfy. The excess occurs when the jobless rate
dips below
            NAIRU, causing wages and inflation to accelerate. But the
process doesn't end
            there. Higher inflation reduces demand and labor markets
readjust, pushing
            joblessness back to the NAIRU level. But the inflation persists
at the higher level,
            partly because people adjust to it.

            Despite the current, unusual situation of low unemployment and
low inflation, the
            old model is alive and well among economists--and at the Fed.
''I am a strong
            and unapologetic proponent of the Phillips curve and the NAIRU
concept,'' says
            Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H. Meyer. Chairman Alan
Greenspan,
            warming to the New Economy, is less enamored. But he
appreciates the model's
            solid track record.

            The Phillips/NAIRU model has practical limitations. But
understanding those
            limits doesn't mean junking the theory. The model can still
work, but it's crucial to
            peg the level of NAIRU--a moving target. Before globalization
and technology
            pushed NAIRU below 6% a few years ago, the model had a
two-decade run as
            one of forecasters' best-performing tools. Now NAIRU may be
even lower than
            the generally accepted range of 5 1/2% to 5 3/4%.

            It can take a year or more for inflation to pick up after a gap
opens between the
            unemployment rate and NAIRU. That's why the Fed's experiment to
test the
            economy's inflationary limit is dangerous. The wider the gap,
the more inflation
            will rise--and it will not fall until the jobless rate exceeds
NAIRU. That is, until the
            Fed steps in to clamp down on the economy, thus throwing a lot
of people out of
            work.

            ECONOMIC WINDFALLS. Another consideration: The Phillips/NAIRU
            model cannot reflect good economic luck, and this U.S. business
cycle has had
            more than its share: falling oil prices, a stronger dollar, and
weaker growth among
            overseas competitors. Also, a slowdown in benefit expenditures
has curbed labor
            costs, even as wage growth has picked up--as the model predicts.

            Right now, the model does not forecast any strong pickup in
inflation. But for
            every half point the jobless rate stays below NAIRU for a year,
inflation will
            accelerate by a quarter point. And a stronger second half could
send the
            unemployment rate even lower.

            That's great--if you're seeking employment. But traditional
inflation theory says
            that, if the Fed's current gamble with tight job markets fails,
the costs of excess
            demand now will be foregone output and income later on. Even in
the New
            Economy, the old approach to gauging future inflation should
scarcely be
            ignored--it should be embraced.

Dear class,

Here is the exam schedule.  Regardless of your regular class day, you can
take the exam either Wednesday 12/15 (start holidays early) or Thursday
12/16 (get that extra 24 hours of studying).  The exam is scheduled from
6:05 to 9:30, but should take far less time than that.

The locations are:
 Wed. C125 for computer users and C135 for handwritten.
 Thurs. C210 for computer users and C220 for handwritten.

Computer users should email me a copy of the exam and (just to be sure)
hand me a diskette as well.

See you soon,
- David

> The Federal Reserve has seen its legislative mandate for monetary policy
> change several times since its founding in 1913, when macroeconomic policy 
as
> such was not clearly understood. The most recent revisions were in 1977 and
> 1978, and they require the Fed to promote both price stability and full
> employment. The past changes in the mandate appear to reflect both economic
> events in the U.S. and advances in understanding how the economy functions.
> In the twenty years since the Fed's mandate was last changed, there have 
been
> further important economic developments as well as refinements in economic
> thought, and these raise the issue of whether to modify the goals for U.S.
> monetary policy once again. Indeed, a number of other countries--notably
> those that adopted the Euro as a common curency at the start of this
> year--have accepted price stability as the new primary goal for their
> monetary policies.
>
> In this Letter, we spell out the evolution of the legislation governing U.S.
> monetary policy goals and summarize the debate about whether they could be
> improved.
>
> The evolution of the Fed's legislative mandate
>
> The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 did not incorporate any macroeconomic goals
> for monetary policy, but instead required the Fed to "provide an elastic
> currency." This meant that the Fed should help the economy avoid the
> financial panics and bank runs that plagued the 19th century by serving as a
> "lender of last resort," which involved making loans directly to depository
> institutions through the discount windows of the Reserve Banks. During this
> early period, most of the actions of monetary policy that affected the macro
> economy were determined by the U.S. government's adherence to the gold
> standard.
>
> The trauma of the Great Depression, coupled with the insights of Keynes
> (1936), led to an acknowledgment of the obligation of the federal government
> to prevent recessions. The Employment Act of 1946 was the first legislative
> statement of these macroeconomic policy goals. Although it did not
> specifically mention the Federal Reserve, it required the federal government
> in general to foster "conditions under which there will be afforded useful
> employment opportunities ... for those able, willing, and seeking to work,
> and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power."
>
> The Great Inflation of the 1970s was the next major U.S. economic
> dislocation. This problem was addressed in a 1977 amendment to the Federal
> Reserve Act, which provided the first explicit recognition of price 
stability
> as a national policy goal. The amended Act states that the Fed "shall
> maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate
> with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to
> promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and
> moderate long-term interest rates." The goals of "stable prices" and
> "moderate long-term interest rates" are related because nominal interest
> rates are boosted by a premium over real rates equal to expected future
> inflation. Thus, "stable prices" will typically produce long-term interest
> rates that are "moderate."
>
> The objective of "maximum" employment remained intact from the 1946
> Employment Act; however, the interpretation of this term may have changed
> during the intervening 30 years. Immediately after World War II, when
> conscription and price controls had produced a high-pressure economy with
> very low unemployment in the U.S., some perhaps believed that the goal of
> "maximum" employment could be taken in its mathematical sense to mean the
> highest possible level of employment. However, by the second half of the
> 1970s, it was well understood that some "frictional" unemployment, which
> involves the search for new jobs and the transition between occupations, is 
a
> necessary accompaniment to the proper functioning of the economy in the long
> run.
>
> This understanding went hand in hand in the latter half of the 1970s with a
> general acceptance of the Natural Rate Hypothesis, which implies that if
> policy were to try to keep employment above its long-run trend permanently
> or, equivalently, the unemployment rate below its natural rate, then
> inflation would be pushed higher and higher. Policy can temporarily
reduce the
> unemployment rate below its natural rate or, equivalently, boost employment
> above its long-run trend. However, persistently attempting to maintain
> "maximum" employment that is above its long-run level would not be 
consistent
> with the goal of stable prices.
>
> Thus, in order for maximum employment and stable prices to be mutually
> consistent goals, maximum employment should be interpreted as meaning 
maximum
> sustainable employment, referred to also as "full employment." Moreover,
> although the Fed has little if any influence on the long-run level of
> employment, it can attempt to smooth out short-run fluctuations. 
Accordingly,
> promoting full employment can be interpreted as a countercyclical monetary
> policy in which the Fed aims to smooth out the amplitude of the business
> cycle.
>
> This interpretation of the Fed's mandate was later confirmed in the
> Humphrey-Hawkins legislation. As its official title--the Full Employment and
> Balanced Growth Act of 1978--clearly implies, this legislation mandates the
> federal government generally to "...promote full employment and production,
> increased real income, balanced growth, a balanced Federal budget, adequate
> productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, achievement of
> an improved trade balance . . . and reasonable price stability..." (italics
> added).
>
> Besides clarifying the general goal of full employment, the Humphrey-Hawkins
> Act also specified numerical definitions or targets. The Act specified two
> initial goals: an unemployment rate of 4% for full employment and a CPI
> inflation rate of 3% for price stability. These were only "interim" goals to
> be achieved by 1983 and followed by a further reduction in inflation to 0% 
by
> 1988; however, the disinflation policies during this period were not to
> impede the achievement of the full-employment goal. Thereafter, the 
timetable
> to achieve or maintain price stability and full employment was to be defined
> by each year's Economic Report of the President.
>
> The debate about the Fed's current mandate
>
> The Fed then has two main legislated goals for monetary policy: promoting
> full employment and promoting stable prices. With this mandate, the Fed has
> helped foster the exceptional performance of the U.S. economy during the 
past
> decade. Still, some have argued that the Fed's mandate could be improved,
> especially in looking ahead to future attempts to maintain or
> institutionalize recent low inflation. Much discussion has centered on two
> topics: the transparency of the goals and their dual nature.
>
> The transparency of goals refers to the extent to which the objectives of
> monetary policy are clearly defined and can be easily and obviously
> understood by the public. The goal of full employment will never be very
> transparent because it is not directly observed but only estimated by
> economists with limited precision. For example, the 1997 Economic Report of
> the President (which has authority in this matter from the Humphrey-Hawkins
> Act) gives a range of 5 to 6% for the unemployment rate consistent with full
> employment, with a midpoint of 5.5%. Research suggests that there is a very
> wide range of uncertainty around any estimate of the natural rate, with one
> prominent study finding a 95% probability that it falls in the wide range of
> 4 to 7-1/2 % (see Walsh 1998).
>
> Price stability as a goal is also subject to some ambiguity. Recent economic
> analysis has uncovered systematic biases, say, on the order of 1 percentage
> point, in the CPI's measurement of inflation (see Motley 1997). In this 
case,
> actual price stability would be consistent with measured inflation of 1%. In
> addition, at any point in time, different price indexes register different
> rates of inflation. Over the past year, for example, the CPI has risen about
> 1-1/2%, while the GDP price index has risen about 1%. Still, a transparent
> price stability goal could be specified as a precise numerical growth rate
> (or range) for a particular index (which could take into account any 
biases).
> However, economists have also suggested other ways to enhance the
> transparency of policy. For example, publishing medium-term inflation
> forecasts might help to clarify the direction of policy (Rudebusch and Walsh
> 1998). Because the central bank has some control over inflation in the 
medium
> term, its forecasts would contain an indication of where it wanted inflation
> to go.
>
> A second recent proposed modification to the Fed's goals involves focusing 
to
> a larger extent on price stability and de-emphasizing business cycle

> coupled with the pain incurred in the 1970s as inflation skyrocketed and in
> the early 1980s as inflation was reduced to moderate levels, persuaded many
> that the primary goal of the central bank should be to stabilize prices.
>
> This view is embodied in the charter for the central bank in the new

> "a balanced development of economic activities."

> Economists remain divided on the importance of the time inconsistency

Fun Midterm

The figure in [brackets] indicates the points and the suggested time for that
question.  The exam is designed to take 70 minutes, but you have 80 minutes to
complete it. (To be honest, 50 minutes should suffice.) PLEASE KEEP WITHIN THE
TIME LIMIT. Be sure to write the starting and ending times on the exam you 
turn
in.

The exam is closed book.  If you are turning in a written copy, please write 
on
only one side of a page, and if your handwriting is as bad as mine, please 
skip
lines.  Label all diagrams clearly.  If you are writing on a PC, feel free to
place diagrams on a separate paper.


I) False, or Uncertain, and Why?  The grade you receive depends solely on the
quality of your explanation.  If you are not sure of what the question 
assumes,
simply state your own assumptions clearly, and answer based on these
assumptions.  Most of the answers should be fairly brief.  When in doubt, 
state
your assumptions (classical vs. Keynesian, long- vs. short-run,...). Answers 
in
this section should typically be two paragraphs, or one paragraph and some
bullet points.  Avoid one-word answers or bullets.

1.      [10] The government should promote a higher rate of saving to increase
output in the long run.

2.      [10] Productivity has risen in recent years in the United States
because
many new workers have joined the labor force to take advantage of the booming
economy.

3.      [10] An unexpected fall in inflation hurts lenders since the nominal
value of the payments they receive is reduced.


II)  Longer answers

4. [20] Illustrate the effects of the recent decision by the European Central
Bank to alter its monetary policy using the ISLM diagram.  If European output
is currently below the level associated with NAIRU, is their decision correct?
Explain.

5. [20] Suggest a cost-effective government policy to increase the human
capital in the country. How (if at all) would your answer differ for Brazil 
vs.
Germany?

        Not Such a Capital Idea

        by Brad De Long and David Levine

        Appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle, December 5, 1995, p. A23.


        In the 1980s Republicans argued that the tax cuts they proposed would
make the economy grow faster because the rich would redirect energy from
avoiding taxes to entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, the theory was wrong. The
most optimistic serious assessment of the effects from the 1981 tax cuts (by
supply-sider Larry Lindsay) show supplyside benefits of the tax cut far lower
than the burden of the debt they generated.

        Now Republicans are again proposing tax cuts. Today skepticism infects
even the core of the Republican coalition. The Wall Street Journal's editorial
pages attacked the tax cuts as being the kind that former Democratic
Congressman Rostenkowski might have producedsurely the worst insult they can
imagine. Principled Republican economic advisers are silent. There is not even
a theory under which the Republicans' capital gains tax cut, child credit, and
increase in taxes on families that qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit
(EITC) could boost growth.

        Start with the capital gains tax cut. It provides no incentives to
boost
investment. No manager deciding whether to build a factory, buy a computer, or
engage in research and development changes his or her calculation of expected
profit because of a reduction in capital gains taxes.

        Some proponents believe the tax cut will boost investment and growth
indirectly by increasing savings. They note that the tax cut raises the
aftertax returns on savings placed in risky assets such as shares of stock.
They then claim higher returns on these assets will, in turn, induce higher
savings. Higher savings will drive down interest rates, which in turn, will
raise business investment and growth.

        But this roundabout chain of cause and effect falls apart at the first
touch. Both the capital gains tax rate and the after-tax return to savings 
have
wandered all over the place in the past generation. Private savings have 
barely
shifted in response. Thus, each dollar of tax cuts increases private savings 
by
less than a dollar. The net effect of the tax cut is to lower the pool of
national savings available to fund investment.  Continued hope that lowering
tax rates will boost American savings and investment is the triumph of faith
over experience.

        The problem is that this tax cut provides an enormous windfall gain to
those who have unrealized capital gains on assets they acquired in the past.
The top one percent of American families with unrealized capital gains hold
about half of these unrealized gains.  While many people realize a small 
amount
of capital gains in any given year, these few families hold trillions of
dollars of unrealized gains. Good tax policies provide incentives for people 
to
work, save, and invest. Bad tax policies reward a wealthy few for decisions
they made in the past.

        A capital gains tax cut may well raise revenue in its first year or
two,
as people liquidate their unrealized gains before the next increase in capital
gains rates. But once the first wave of selling is over, a standard guess is
that the capital gains tax cut will cost about $20 billion a year. When the
government decides to spend $20 billion a year on a tax incentive, shouldn't 
it
choose one likely to boost economic growth for everyone? And shouldn't it be
part of a package that avoids further tilting our distribution of income in an
unhealthy direction?

        The overall effect of the Republican tax proposals on the distribution
of income gives the impression that the congressional majority is waging a
onesided class war: the cuts in the Earned Income Tax Credit and the details 
of
how the child credit is paid add up to roughly $2.2 billion a year in tax
increases on families with annual incomes less than $30,000, and tax decreases
of some $2.8 billion$7,000 or so per familyon those with incomes of more than
$200,000.

        Early in the nineteenth century, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in the
introduction to Democracy in America of "equality of conditions as the 
creative
element" that made America great. This substantial "equality of conditions" 
was
under threat once, in the generation of the Gilded Age, and almost turned
America into a very different and worse country. This year's tax changes are
another step in a series that places it under threat again.
        Brad De Long and David Levine teach economics and business at the
University of California, Berkeley.



Addendum:
        Due to space constraints, the editorial omitted three (sometimes
offsetting) issues concerning how the capital gains tax treats time.  The
capital gains tax over-taxes gains because it taxes nominal gains, including
gains that are due solely to inflation.  Thus, if inflation doubles average
prices over a decade, someone who sells an asset that also doubles in nominal
value will face taxation although the asset's real value was constant.
        The capital gains tax under-taxes gains because the tax on unrealized
gains is not collected until a sale. This delay is like the federal government
lending the value of the uncollected tax at zero interest; at low inflation 
the
under-taxation due to value of this loan is usually larger than the
over-taxation due to the first effect.
        Moreover, if the person dies holding the gain, the tax on unrealized
gains is forgiven -- a somewhat bizarre feature of the tax system.  This 
latter
feature makes the tax ineffective at collecting revenue from the very wealthy,
who merely delay sales of their appreciated assets.

taxes on inherited unrealized gains, and (this is trickier) should try to
minimize the value of lost tax due to holding appreciated assets.
