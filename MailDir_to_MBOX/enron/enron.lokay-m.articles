Devon Energy and Santa Fe Snyder completed their $2.5 billion merger 
yesterday as shareholders of both companies approved the deal, which was 
announced in May. The agreement called for each Santa Fe Snyder common share 
to be converted into 0.22 shares of Devon common stock. Conversion requires 
issuance of 40.6 million additional Devon common shares, resulting in total 
shares outstanding of 127.7 million. Former Santa Fe Snyder shareholders now 
own 32% of the combined company. Historical Devon shareholders own 68% of the 
combined company. The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of 
interests. With merger completion, Devon now ranks among the top five 
U.S.-based independent oil and gas producers in terms of market 
capitalization, total proved reserves and annual production. The company has 
an enterprise value of $9 billion and proved reserves of 1.1 billion boe. The 
company expects to realize $30 million to $35 million in annual cost savings 
from the merger. Devon was added to the S&P 500 Index after the close of 
business yesterday.

Fitch Puts 2 CA Utilities on Negative Watch 

In the midst of the continuing uncertainty over regulatory treatment of 
growing wholesale electricity cost under-collections, Fitch Tuesday assigned 
a "rating watch negative" designation to the securities of California's two 
largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern 
California Edison (and its parent company, Edison International). In 
addition, it lowered Edison's commercial paper rating one notch to "F1" from 
"F1+". 

Fitch cited the need for "significant and extensive regulatory decisions" to 
resolve the continuing problem of retail utility electric rate 
under-collections plaguing both utilities. It indicated that with the "watch 
negative" status, the independent rating service expects to review the 
ratings within six months. 

A spokesperson for PG&E Corp., the parent of Pacific Gas and Electric, said 
the Fitch move doesn't lower any of its ratings, but it "underscores the 
seriousness of the situation (in California) and the need for all the parties 
to come together for a collaborative solution." The companies have asked for 
relief from the California Public Utilities Commission (see Daily GPI, Oct. 
30). Edison is the target of an investors' lawsuit which accuses it of 
illegally booking as revenue the wholesale power costs that have yet to be 
collected. (see Daily GPI, Nov. 1). 

The Fitch move had no effect on PG&E's latest utility debt line extension of 
$1.3 billion that was implemented recently in response to the continuing 
under-collections, the spokesperson said. Fitch reiterated that through 
September the two utilities had booked under-collections exceeding $5 billion 
collectively and that wholesale power prices continue to exceed the 
utilities' frozen retail rate levels. 

"While these amounts exceed immediate funding requirements, their recovery 
through rates is uncertain," Fitch stated in its announcement on the negative 
watch. "Barring a change in regulatory policy, PG&E and SoCal Edison 
anticipate they will be unable to recover their under-collections before the 
end of the statutory rate freeze period ending March 31, 2002.

*********************************************************

Cold November weather, with heating degree-days 22 percent above normal 
through
the twenty-fifth, fueled withdrawals from storage that CERA estimates will 
average
approximately 8.5 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day for the month, near the 
all-time
record for November set in 1995. This is approximately 5.0 Bcf per day higher 
than
the previously expected withdrawal rate under normal weather conditions. The 
result
is that storage inventories as of the end of the month are about 500 Bcf 
below the
year-earlier level and are on track to dip well into record low territory by 
the end of
the winter (see Table 1).

For December, normal weather would result in storage withdrawals of 17.0 Bcf 
per
day on average for the month. At that rate, storage inventories would fall 
below 2.0
trillion cubic feet (Tcf) by the end of the year, the first time that has 
ever occurred.
By the end of March CERA expects working inventories to be reduced to 606 Bcf 
in
the United States, compared with the previous record low of 758 Bcf.

This weather and high withdrawal rates have moved prices higher within the 
wide
and volatile range between residual fuel oil and distillate, with gas prices 
moving
farther above those of resid ($4.75 to $5.00) and closer to the price of 
distillate fuel
oil (approximately $7.00). Strength in the oil market has kept the 
resid-distillate
range high, but should gas test either boundary of this range, the price of 
either
distillate or resid would move as well. Under normal weather CERA now expects
December prices to average $6.25 at the Henry Hub, a higher level within this 
range
reflective of reduced storage inventories.

Although prices have abated somewhat in recent days and will continue to rise 
and
fall with weather and weather forecasts, fundamentals now are so tight that a 
return
to cold weather would quickly drive prices back above $6.50 and potentially 
above
$7.00 at the Henry Hub. It is only at that level or above that any significant
additional demand response is likely, and even then such a response would 
require
time. The possibility of curtailments of interruptible loads late this winter 
has grown,
while the possibility of significant price relief appears increasingly remote.

DEFS Finishes 2000 With Multiple Transactions

Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) finished off 2000 with a bang by completing 
three year-end asset transactions. First, the company finalized the $91 
million sale of natural gas liquid (NGL) pipeline assets to TEPPCO Crude 
Pipeline, L.P., then it completed the purchase of certain natural gas 
pipeline assets from El Paso Field Services in two separate deals for an 
undisclosed sum. 

The assets sold to TEPPCO include the Panola Pipeline and the San Jacinto 
Pipeline, both of which are NGL pipelines. Under the agreement, TEPPCO also 
agreed to take over the lease of a 34-mile condensate pipeline. The three 
pipelines included in the sale all originate at DEFS' East Texas Plant 
Complex located in Panola County, TX. 

"This sale underscores our strategy of growing earnings through our TEPPCO 
master limited partnership," said Jim Mogg, CEO of DEFS. "In 2000, we almost 
doubled the distribution that DEFS received as the general partner of TEPPCO 
Partners, L.P., and at the same time increased the distribution to limited 
partnership unitholders." 

In the second transaction, which the company completed on Dec. 28, 2000, DEFS 
acquired 100% of Gas Transmission Teco, Inc.'s common stock. The company owns 
interests in the 500-mile Teco intrastate natural gas pipeline in Texas, and 
was purchased from El Paso Field Services. 

Included in the assets, DEFS gained a 50% interest in the El Paso-operated 
West Texas Line which travels from Waha to New Braunfels, a 100% interest in 
the Guadalupe Line that travels from New Braunfels to Dewville, and a 50% 
interest in the MidTex Line from Dewville to Katy. DEFS also received several 
supply lines and related assets with the acquisition. 

DEFS said the lines combined have a 250 MMcf/d of natural gas capacity, and 
extend from Waha in West Texas to Katy. The company also noted that the lines 
interconnect five DEFS plants with a combined processing capacity of 640 
MMcf/d. 

"The timely addition of this strategic system provides DEFS with increased 
marketing opportunities for the gas from these plants," said Mogg. "The lines 
also allow DEFS new access to the growing San Antonio/Austin corridor." 

In DEFS' third end of the year transaction, the company acquired El Paso 
Field Services' 50% interest in the 265-mile San Jacinto natural gas 
pipeline. The transaction brings DEFS' ownership up to 100%. The San Jacinto 
line provides gas gathering and transportation services along the Texas Gulf 
Coast, with delivery to a third party and two DEFS gas processing plants. 

DEFS was formed last year when Duke Energy and Phillips Petroleum combined 
their natural gas gathering and processing businesses. Duke Energy holds a 
70% stake in the company while Phillips retains a 30% share.

Shippers Condemn Northwest's Must-Flow OFOs

Several northern Nevada industrial gas users have accused Northwest Pipeline 
of violating its tariff by holding them hostage to the daily must-flow 
operational flow orders (OFOs) that it has issued since early December in an 
effort to compensate for the sizable capacity shortfall on its system. 

In a Section 5 complaint filed Friday, the industrial gas customers called on 
FERC to direct Northwest to "cease and desist" the alleged violation of the 
tariff, which they claim is forcing them and other customers at the northern 
end of the pipeline to subsidize the gas acquisition and transportation costs 
of customers on the southern end of Northwest's system. 

The effect of the must-flow OFOs is to compel shippers to make up the 
capacity shortfall on Northwest's system via displacement, the industrials 
noted. Northwest's firm contractual demand is 720,000 Dth/d, but its physical 
capacity is only 474,000 Dth/d. Pan-Alberta Gas (U.S.) Inc. provides 144,000 
Dth/d through a displacement arrangement, while shippers are left to make up 
the remaining 102,000 Dth/d. 

The industrial users contend they shouldn't be penalized for not complying 
with the must-flow OFOs because Northwest's tariff exempts shippers that have 
made "good faith efforts" to obtain gas supply, but have been unsuccessful. 
At issue is whether the "good faith efforts" applies to purchasing gas at 
reasonable costs, which is how the industrials interpret the tariff, or 
whether it means that shippers should be required to buy gas "at any price" 
to meet a must-flow OFO. The latter, according to the industrial users, is 
Northwest's position. 

The "regulatory history" of Northwest's tariff "makes clear that 'good faith 
efforts' to obtain a gas supply at the Stanfield [OR] receipt point need not 
extend to purchasing 'gas at any price,' but rather must be viewed in the 
context of current conditions and circumstances, i.e. available prices and 
supplies," the industrial customers said. "Where a shipper can secure gas 
needed to meet a must-flow order only at the basin price differentials that 
currently prevail, and assuming that the shipper can document such efforts 
and impacts for Northwest verification, the shipper's request for exemption 
from penalties must be granted." Northwest twice has refused such a request 
by the industrial customers, they noted. 

In anticipation of the high gas prices this month, the Nevada industrial 
users said they chose to switch to alternative fuels "where feasible" or to 
curtail operations rather than use their released capacity on Northwest. 
Nevertheless, the pipeline's daily must-flow OFOs "have forced them into the 
volatile daily gas market to avoid extremely high non-compliance penalties, 
undermining their business decisions to rely on alternative fuels," they told 
FERC [RP01-189]. 

In order to comply with Northwest's orders, the industrials said they "must 
ship the gas to a point where they cannot use it, [and] can only sell it at 
the Rocky Mountain basin prices, which is a fraction of the price at which, 
under current conditions, they purchased it." 

The industrial users said they have had to comply with Northwest's must-flow 
OFOs, given the hefty penalties they would face otherwise. The penalties are 
equal to the greater of $10/Dth or four times the highest spot rate at Sumas, 
Stanfield, Kingsgate, Opal or Ignacio for the month of non-compliance. Based 
on the spot rate at Stanfield, the penalty this month was $58.15/Dth. 

If one of the Nevada industrial users, Newmont Mining Corp., had defied 
Northwest's order to flow 25% of its contract demand, or 1,000/Dth, on any 
December day, it would have been penalized $58,160 for that one day, they 
said. If all of the Nevada industrial customers had violated the pipeline's 
order, the one-day penalty would have been $149,471. 

The industrial shippers want FERC to go beyond interpreting the "good faith 
efforts" exemption in their favor. They contend that Northwest' tariff 
allowing must-flow OFOs "as currently structured" is both "unreasonable and 
unduly discriminatory." That's because it requires one group of shippers, who 
see no additional benefits, to incur gas acquisition and transportation costs 
solely to subsidize service to another group of shippers, they argued. They 
believe the shippers who benefit should pay for the displacement capacity 
costs. 

Currently, the must-flow OFOs "result in southbound flows [on Northwest] that 
create northbound capacity for the benefit of shippers with south-to-north 
entitlements. Those same south-to-north shippers could, however, themselves 
purchase spot gas in the Canadian supply areas and ship such volumes 
southward on an interruptible basis on Northwest, i.e. do what [the 
industrial] shippers and others have been directed to do. They could pay the 
costs of the capacity that they want." 

As an alternative, Northwest could require a sharing of displacement capacity 
costs by all shippers using its system at a given time when capacity is 
short, or it could invest in facilities so that it has the physical capacity 
to meet all of its contractual commitments, the industrial users said.

Texans Bake as Electricity Usage Hits Record

By today, a "cool" spell was expected to grip Texas, plunging temperatures 
down to around 100. A nice respite from the 105-plus temperatures that 
stilled the state and sent electricity peak loads to new records last week 
for the third time this year. 

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), an industry coalition that 
administers the state's power grid and serves 85% of the state's electric 
load, reported Friday that preliminary numbers indicated that electricity 
usage reached an all-time peak high for the third time in 44 days last 
Thursday, with Texans using 57,731 MW of power. Of course, that was before 
the weekend, when temperatures were expected to climb as high as 112 at some 
locations in the state --- just in time for Labor Day picnics. 

The new usage record last Thursday broke the previous record set the day 
before, on Wednesday, when consumers used 55,994 MW of power. The two broken 
records broke a record set just six weeks earlier, July 19, when Texans used 
55,796 MW of power. 

Peak load in August 1999 was 54,849 MW of power, while peak load in August 
1998 was 53,689 MW of power.

Questar Can't Sell from Proposed Pipeline Under New CA Rate 
Although not giving up its search for customers in California, Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp.'s oil-to-natural-gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners of New Mexico remains stymied in operating its portion within California under a newly revised "peaking tariff" for Southern California Gas Co., according to Questar officials who have been analyzing the new rate established Aug. 2 by state regulators.  Questar is looking at alternative uses for the California portion of the approved interstate pipeline. 
"We can't work with (the rate) as it is," said Chad Jones, a Questar spokesperson. "It definitely doesn't go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in Southern California. It still doesn't level the playing field. Although it is better than the current RLS (residual load service) tariff; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCalGas competitor. 
"Customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state, and higher rates for balancing services. We're at the point where we're not going to stop trying to market capacity on Southern Trails, but we're definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the California portion (of the 700-miles, 16-inch-diameter pipeline)." 
One of the alternatives would be to operate the California part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the Long Beach Harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the California-Arizona border. That's the alternative, however, Jones said, but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline's 120 MMcf/d capacity is still Questar's preference. 
After months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives, the California Public Utilities Commission last week established a new "peaking" or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a SoCalGas competitor, allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility, SoCalGas. 
The CPUC tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers, while trying to "encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry-picking or overbuilding," according to CPUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Questar officials said Tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources, and they are "not about to go head-to-head with the established big boys" in lobbying California's governor or state legislature, Jones said. "Thus, we're still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in Southern California in the name of promoting competition." 
The east-of-California portion of the Southern Trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid-year next year, Jones said.

Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.

Note:  Alliance says they are flowing 40-50% of capacity at this time 
(400-500 MMBtu/d 
hitting the Chicago market).  It sounds like they have not yet been able to 
commission the
Aux Sable plant because of the trash gas they are still pushing through.  
Some predictors 
are saying the delay may get longer.

Alliance Service Delay Extended to End of November

Alliance Pipeline conceded yesterday that its commercial in-service date will 
have to be delayed for the third time, this time until the end of November, 
because of continued problems with debris in the pipe and trouble getting the 
enormously complex components of the system working in sync. The 1,900-mile 
project originally was supposed to be in service Oct. 1. 

"Normal commissioning activities are continuing and most of the debris has 
been removed from the line," says Alliance CEO Norm Gish. "However, periodic 
reductions in the flow of test gas due to the debris have complicated the 
required integration with concurrent commissioning activities at the Aux 
Sable Liquid Products processing facility near Chicago." A spokesman said the 
debris included "bits of foam" that came off equipment used to extract 
moisture following hydrostatic testing. 

The complexity of the Alliance Pipeline operations also has led some 
observers to predict a lengthy delay before commercial service. The pipeline 
has an immensely complicated system patented by Alliance engineers that is 
designed to transport gas liquids in a gas phase with the 1.325 Bcf/d of 
natural gas from British Columbia and northern Alberta through 1,900 miles of 
pipe to the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant near Chicago. The pipeline 
also incorporates a cutting edge electronic control system designed to allow 
the pipeline to be operated by a single pilot in a downtown Calgary control 
room. Alliance operators say they are actually operating three pipelines: a 
physical pipe, a paper pipe and an e-pipe, which brings all aspects of the 
operation together around the clock 365 days a year. "It's a tremendously 
complicated system and all the parts are interdependent, for it to work, they 
all have to work together." 

Regardless of the delay, however, Alliance already is flowing a large amount 
of gas into the Chicago market. "At this point in our commissioning 
activities, the system is flowing at approximately 40 to 50% of capacity. We 
expect to continue increasing the volume of test gas and approaching our firm 
delivery capacity of 37.5 million cubic meters (1.325 Bcf) per day prior to 
the end of November."

Nymex Moves Gas Opening Bell Up to 9:30 a.m.

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange has amended plans 
to move 
up the start-up time for natural gas futures trading because of the overlap 
with crude oil markets, 
which share an options ring with natural gas. Daily gas futures trading now 
will commence at 
9:30 a.m. rather than 9:45. The board has scheduled expanded energy trading 
hours to begin 
with the Sept. 8 trading session. 

On July 13, the board voted to expand futures trading hours electronically 
for its light sweet crude 
oil, heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas futures and options markets. It 
also voted to have an 
earlier opening for the open outcry session for natural gas futures and 
options.

Beginning at 4 p.m. on Sept. 7 the Nymex Access electronic trading sessions 
for those commodities 
will be extended to run from 4 p.m., Mondays through Thursdays, to 9 a.m. the 
following day. On 
Sundays, the session will begin at 7 p.m. and will run until 9 a.m. on 
Monday. Currently, the sessions 
for light sweet crude oil, heating oil and gasoline begin at the same times 
but close at 8 a.m. Natural 
gas futures and options currently are traded from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Mondays 
through Thursdays with 
no Sunday night session.

Breaking News : Phased MarketLink Project, Questar Expansion Approved 
posted 10:50 AM (CST) Dec 13, 2000 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authorized Transcontinental Gas 
Pipe Line (Transco) to phase in construction of its 700 MMcf/d MarketLink 
project, which would expand its Leidy Line from western Pennsylvania to 
markets in New Jersey and New York.

Phase I of MarketLink would add 166,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity on Transco 
to serve five shippers beginning Nov. 1, 2001. Phase II would add 130,000 
Dth/d to serve two shippers by Nov. 1 2002. FERC denied requests by the state 
of New Jersey and the state's Department of Law and Public Safety to rescind 
and vacate an April certificate approving construction of the entire 
MarketLink project. However, the Commission is requiring Transco to file 
executed contracts fully subscribing the remaining capacity within four 
months of the order. If the contracts are not filed, Transco can not initiate 
eminent domain proceedings with respect to the remaining facilities covered 
by the original certificate.

The Commission also granted Questar a preliminary determination on 
non-environmental grounds, saying its proposed Mainline 104 looping project 
and interconnection with Kern River Pipeline is required by the public. The 
$80.8 million Questar project would add 272,000 Dth/d of capacity. M.L. 104 
would run from coal-seam reserves in the Uinta Basin near Price, UT, to the 
Payson Citygate and the connection with Kern River. The project would loop a 
portion of Questar's M.L. No. 40 and the entire M.L. No. 41. Both lines 
currently are running full.

Note:  The assets for sale are in the Midcontinent, Rockies, and Gulf Coast areas.  They also play to put certain assets (like Valero) into their MLP.  LB

El Paso to Sell Gulf, Midcontinent, Rockies Assets 
El Paso Corp. added a little more flavor to its $2.25 billion divestiture plan for next year, pinpointing three major locations -- the Gulf of Mexico, Midcontinent and the Rocky Mountains -- as areas where assets will be sold by the second quarter of 2002. The plan, part of a massive overhaul by the management team within the past few days, comes as El Paso shores up its balance sheet triggered in part by Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy and a host of other problems that have hit the energy industry this year. 
According to Ralph Eads, president of the El Paso Merchant Energy Group, the assets are "things that we would have sold previously, but were not in a position to do." CEO William Wise noted that El Paso's earnings into next year would be "less attributable to divestitures and a reduction in capital and mostly in (cutbacks) in the international power business." Wise added that 80% of El Paso's earnings before interest and taxes are "things we can point to with specificity." 
The plan was part of a major overhaul announced by the company on Wednesday.  Though the company has not specifically announced which assets it will divest in the next two quarters, Eads included these locations on the short list: 
Gulf of Mexico assets, "particularly the deepwater," where El Paso does not have significant interests and some of its shelf properties in the Gulf; 
Midcontinent assets; 
Rockies assets, including properties in the Piceance basin. 
El Paso also is divesting some Texas midstream assets to its master limited partnership. These assets include the sale of EPGT Texas Pipeline (GTT) -- formerly PG&E Gas Transmission Texas and before that Valero -- to El Paso Energy Partners LP (EPN). Also to be sold are some refinery assets, including the Eagle Point refinery and some coal assets that had been part of The Coastal Corp. (which has since merged with El Paso). 
Even with the projected asset sales, Eads said that production in 2002 will increase about 2%, reaching 660 Bcfe/d with a capital budget of $1.7 billion. "The budget is oriented toward drilling and drilling opportunities," said Eads. He said El Paso views its exploration and production unit "as a bank," and expects the unit to generate more than $1 billion next year. 
Operationally, he said El Paso is on track to add 1.5 Bcf from its Gulf of Mexico and South Texas properties, "the strongest drilling performance of any company in the United States." The major expansion will be in South Texas, where Eads said El Paso has substantial assets. "We have 400 Bcfe in South Texas fields alone...136 locations left and most of those are not booked. We feel very good about our ability to sustain our production in South Texas," and he added that the company's Santa Fe field was the "best we've ever found."

Williams to Expand Kern River by 124,500 Dth/d

Kern River Gas Transmission, a subsidiary of Williams, said it planned on 
filing an application yesterday with FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional 
firm transportation capacity to its 922-mile pipeline system. The company 
said the California Expansion Project will not only provide additional 
natural gas capacity from Wyoming to markets in California, but also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on the recent approval by FERC of Kern River's 
Extended Term Rate Program. 

"A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. 

The project includes construction of three new compressor stations, an 
additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, restaging a 
compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. Kern River said the $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002. 

The company said demand for firm transportation on Kern River was driven by 
several factors: the diversion of Canadian gas supplies to markets in the 
Midwest from the Pacific region; increased production in the Rocky Mountain 
basin; strong economic growth in Kern River's market areas; and increased 
demand from gas-fired electric generation facilities. 

Williams said it anticipates holding an open season later this year to 
determine the level of market interest in a second expansion of the Kern 
River pipeline. "The demand for competitively priced transportation to 
markets in Nevada and California continues to grow. At the same time, gas 
producers in the Rocky Mountain basin are stepping up production. An 
expansion on Kern River in 2003 could help bring that production to market," 
said Morgan.

Nevada Goes for the Gold

By Dave Todd 
dtodd@ftenergy.com <mailto:dtodd@ftenergy.com> 

It's a reverse twist on America's economic history. One might even call it a 
case of Eastward Ho!

For the first time in the nearly two centuries that California has been part 
of the United States, entrepreneurs are talking about leaving, not moving 
into, the Golden State because of potential opportunities for doing business 
to the east. Not much farther east, only over the mountains into neighboring 
states, but still in that direction, as opposed to jurisdictions north or 
south of California. And the biggest lights in the eyes of one particular 
industry are emanating from Nevada. 

Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology 
Association, recently warned that massive power price increases and future 
rate hikes "could be the genesis for industry departures from the state." The 
impact on large industrial users, he warned, could "provide an impetus for a 
statewide economic downturn" in California, which accounts for about 12% of 
the United States GDP.

California's mass exodus
Since the beginning of the year, Nevada's primary economic development 
agencies have been overwhelmed by California companies wanting to relocate 
some or all of their operations to the state. The bad news for California is 
that the list includes many Silicon Valley enterprises or "wannabes" whose 
growth planning units have been gripped by uncertainty about the 
dependability of future electric supply delivery.

Somer Hollingsworth, president and CEO of the Nevada Development Authority in 
Las Vegas, said in late January he was urgently asked to meet with corporate 
officials of a major California company to brief them about relocating to 
Nevada. In meeting with the company he asked, "Are there others like you? And 
they said, yes, we can introduce you to company after company after company." 

Overwhelmingly, it is high-tech California companies that are most interested 
in moving because of their ever-growing requirements for reliability in their 
electric service. Beyond that, "We have five power companies that have 
already come down here and talked to us-power producers," he said. These 
companies, including Calpine Corp., are keen to take advantage of a variety 
of opportunities made easier by the fact that, unlike California, Nevada has 
no state income tax and no general corporate or business inventory tax, 
putting it at both a geographical proximity and tax advantage to California. 
It also puts Nevada ahead of other low-tax Western states such as Arizona, 
Colorado and Utah. 

Reno/Silicon Valley share symbiotic relationship
Hollingsworth's northern counterpart at Reno's public/private sector-backed 
agency, the Economic Development Association of Western Nevada (EDAWN), tells 
a similar story. Chuck Alvey, who heads that body, says interest in his city 
from Silicon Valley refugees is becoming intense. 

A mere three-hours' drive and 40-minute plane ride from the San Francisco/San 
Jose area, Reno and Lake Tahoe already house hundreds of high-tech industry 
executives who commute back and forth and who have, up to now, escaped the 
impact of power drains caused by their energy-intensive industries. "Server 
farms," banks of computers that manage Web sites and related business 
operations, continue to grow in number. A single server farm can require as 
much as 10 MW of power to operate.

Strict new federal energy efficiency standards, to curb demand by other power 
hogs, such as residential central air conditioners and heat pumps, clothes 
washers, water heaters and commercial heating and cooling equipment, won't be 
implemented in time to affect the current power crisis. The U.S. Department 
of Energy last month announced that the energy conservation measures could 
save consumers and businesses more than $19 billion over the next 30 years. 

Though the energy saved would eliminate the need for 40,000 MW of new power 
generation, the new standards wouldn't be phased in until between 2003 and 
2007. 

Stan Thomas, director of business planning and growth strategies for Sierra 
Pacific Power Co., Nevada's dominant energy company, said his business has 
"experienced great success" at moving Silicon Valley-based firms' divisions 
into Nevada, albeit in a limited way. "But we're seeing a lot more companies 
saying: 'Wait a minute. We can't operate here anymore with power being shut 
off, and having payrolls to meet and not producing any product.' " 

He added that getting "a little more aggressive" about enticing electricity 
supply-constrained companies to relocate to Nevada is no longer likely to be 
seen as a cherry-picking operation at another state's expense. In fact, 
Nevada froze its electric deregulation planning last year, pausing to 
reconsider its options, as a direct result of California's policy confusion. 
"We have delayed until we have a plan together where capacity exceeds (native 
in-state) demand," said Thomas. 

Sierra Pacific's power delivery capabilities are being enhanced by its plan 
to build a new 345-kV line in eastern Nevada to import power from Utah. In 
1998, it also installed a major line into the Pacific Northwest. Both 
developments are significant because the company has switched its strategy to 
become more of a power transmission distribution company than a generator. 

"We're learning our lesson here," said Thomas. Setting aside the issue of 
burgeoning energy demand requirements across the West, the need to recover 
stranded costs associated with deregulation is a preoccupation for power 
plant-owners in general, he said. 

As for California, " I think the next couple of years are going to be some 
tight times, no doubt about it. And that's why what we're trying to do (in 
Nevada) is secure long-term contracts as well as short-term contracts to 
protect our customers while we're in the process of securing capacity, to 
ensure that we have an adequate supply of electricity at reasonable rates." 

Other areas targeting California companies
It's not just Nevada's physical proximity to California that helps it attract 
relocating companies. It's also the different opportunities offered by 
Nevada's two main population centers, Reno and Las Vegas. Both cities attract 
different kinds of energy-dependent businesses from California. In this 
regard, "We are two different markets," said Thomas.

In any case, Nevada isn't the only state that's getting calls, and returning 
interest in kind. Half a continent away, Tennessee's state department of 
economic and community development recently targeted about 1,000 California 
companies with financial enticements and advertisements that proclaim "the 
lights are always on" in the electric power-rich Tennessee Valley Authority's 
service territory. Elsewhere across the nation, from Seattle to Manhattan, 
there are initiatives to build or refurbish buildings to make them capable of 
servicing high-energy demand, Internet-related data centers. 

Nevada, however, has one giant advantage, aside from being closer to 
California. Las Vegas, for example, has one of the most extensive, readily 
accessible black fiber systems of any major metropolitan area in the United 
States. But of course it would. As the Nevada Development Authority's 
Hollingsworth joked: "Most everything we have here is state-of-the-art and 
brand new because we blow everything up every 20 years. We just implode it 
and build something new." The most recent casualty to fall to progress was 
the El Rancho Hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, deemed past its prime, which bit 
the dust in October in a televised entertainment spectacle. Power to the 
people.

UtiliCorp to Re-Acquire and Then Become Aquila 
UtiliCorp United announced plans to buy back the 20% of its trading and risk management arm, Aquila Inc., that it sold to the public earlier this year and adopt Aquila as its corporate name. The move is a strategic reversal apparently prompted by the weakening economy and industry changes. Executives dodged questions as to whether the move was spurred by the financial troubles at the energy industry's largest trading house, Enron Corp. 
On this busy Wednesday, UtiliCorp also released its earnings, and reported that it has entered into an acquisition agreement with a FirstEnergy Corp. subsidiary. 
UtiliCorp said its board of directors voted to make an exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding publicly held common shares of its 80%-owned Aquila Inc. subsidiary due to the "recent significant changes in the merchant energy sector, the general economy and the impact of these changes on the capital markets." 
"The most significant influence, however, was the realization that greater shareholder value could be obtained by recombining the financial strength of UtiliCorp with the growth opportunities that lie ahead for Aquila," said Richard C. Green, Jr., chairman and CEO of UtiliCorp. "With its larger asset base, earnings potential and cash flow, the combined company will have more efficient access to capital to execute its ambitious plans. Industry-watchers questioned whether some of the spark for the recombining of the trading operation with the hard-asset backed parent, could have been prompted by Enron's current debacle. 
When asked during the conference call if the Enron situation factored in the decision to combine UtiliCorp and Aquila, Robert Green said, "The decision evolved over the recent few weeks as we evaluated the opportunities in front of Aquila, and the current conditions in the capital market. [We] effectively came to the conclusion that if we are going to put Aquila in a position to execute on these opportunities, it is essential that we recombine the businesses and the balance sheets to execute on the opportunities that we see in the marketplace that are precipitated by the decline in the capital markets, and the fact that the equity markets are shutdown." 
"The merchant strategy behind Aquila's rapid growth has been a key driver behind UtiliCorp's achievement of aggressive earnings targets," Richard Green said. "We decided that UtiliCorp shareholders would be better served by embracing the Aquila energy merchant strategy as the company's core strategy, rather than spinning the business off as a separate entity. To symbolize that change in thinking, we intend to adopt 'Aquila' as our corporate name after our exchange offer is completed." The company said in its conference call that it expects to complete the reacquisition of Aquila by "early January." 
Richard Green also said he will take on a new role, effective Jan. 1, 2002, initially as chairman of UtiliCorp and later of the new company that will be formed from UtiliCorp United and Aquila, Inc. Robert K. Green, president and COO of UtiliCorp, will be elevated to president and CEO of the new Aquila. 
UtiliCorp said all public Aquila shareholders will be offered 0.6896 shares of UtiliCorp common stock in a tax-free exchange for each outstanding share of Aquila Class A common stock. Based on yesterday's closing price of $17.99 per share for Aquila Class A common stock and $30 per share for UtiliCorp common stock, the offer represents a value of $20.69 per Class A share of Aquila and a 15% premium to yesterday's closing price of those shares. "Aquila shareholders will have the opportunity to continue to participate in Aquila's growth through their ongoing ownership of UtiliCorp shares, and to receive cash dividends as UtiliCorp shareholders," Richard Green said. 
The offer requires that at least a majority of Aquila's publicly held Class A shares are tendered. After successful completion of the exchange offer, UtiliCorp has committed to complete a 'short-form' merger of Aquila with a UtiliCorp subsidiary. In the merger, each remaining Aquila Class A share will be converted (subject to the exercise of appraisal rights) into the same number of shares of UtiliCorp common stock as are paid in the exchange offer. UtiliCorp plans to file its offering materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commence the exchange offer as soon as possible. 
"Over the past year, I have devoted an increasing amount of time and energy to raising other chief executives' awareness of Aquila's broad capabilities," Richard Green said. "We have a unique position in the emerging market that is being created by the convergence of the insurance, capital and energy businesses, combining our expertise in risk management, wholesale energy, structured financing, generation assets and other related activities. We can help clients in countless industries in ways they've never thought of, and that opportunity is largely driving this change in executive roles." 
The company also reported Wednesday that it expects to enter into an acquisition agreement with FirstEnergy Corp. under which UtiliCorp and a financial partner will purchase FirstEnergy's wholly owned Avon Energy Partners Holdings subsidiary, the holding company for Midlands Electricity plc. Midlands Electricity is the fourth-largest regional electricity company in the United Kingdom and serves 2.3 million network customers. UtiliCorp said the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2002 after receipt of regulatory approvals. In the company's conference call, Robert Green said the acquisition would likely be "strongly accretive" in 2002. 
In releasing its earnings, UtiliCorp followed the strong third quarter results from its Aquila subsidiary and reported earnings per share for the third quarter 2001 were $0.58, up 16% from last year's third quarter after adjusting for the $0.30 gain from the 2000 initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. in Australia. The company posted earnings for the quarter of $68.9 million, a decrease from the $74.9 million mark for the same quarter of 2000. UtiliCorp said energy sales for the quarter were $9.3 billion, up 16% from $8 billion during the third quarter of 2000. 
"At Aquila, we continue to see increasing client demand for our risk management solutions," said Robert Green. "In addition, our recent capacity acquisitions are performing beyond our expectations. Our network businesses continue to help fuel our core growth in earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). Combining that with the solid results from Aquila, UtiliCorp continues to be on track to deliver at least 15% earnings growth this year." 
UtiliCorp CFO Dan Streek said during the conference call that the company expects 2001 EPS to be in the area of $2.95. The CFO added that this "far exceeds" the company's 15% growth target. For 2002 guidance, Streek said the combined EPS for UtiliCorp and Aquila would be around $2.92. 
Earnings before income taxes (EBIT) for the quarter UtiliCorp were led by strong contributions from Aquila as well as the international business segment. Aquila's operations increased from $40.8 million to $44.2 million (net of minority interests of $7.4 million) in the 2001 third quarter, marking a 26% increase. UtiliCorp attributed some of Aquila's growth to the fact that gas and power commodity markets are slowing down, forcing Aquila's clients to focus more on risk and how they can minimize exposure. As a result, Aquila has seen an increase in its client-focused businesses. Additionally, Aquila's December 2000 acquisition of interests in six power plants through its purchase of GPU International have provided stronger-than-expected operating results. 
The company reported that gas trading volumes in the third quarter increased 11%, from 12.1 Bcf/d during the third quarter 2000 to 13.4 Bcf/d. Power volumes increased 98%, from 44 million MWh to 87 million MWh. 
EBIT from international networks increased 57% to $48.5 million from $30.9 million in the 2000 third quarter, excluding last year's gain of $44 million or $.30 per share from the initial public offering of Uecomm, Ltd. The company said EBIT from Canada and Australia increased, primarily due to the full quarter contribution of electric properties in Alberta, purchased on Aug. 31, 2000, and strong performance in Australia related to continued strength in the United Energy business and the addition of AlintaGas, which was purchased in October 2000. 
In the United States, UtiliCorp's networks had EBIT of $47.4 million in the third quarter of 2001, compared to $45.3 million in the 2000 period. The company said the contribution from the St. Joseph Light & Power division, acquired at the end of 2000, was partially offset by higher operating costs.

Chevron and Texaco Agree to $100 Billion Merger

Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. announced plans to merge and ChevronTexaco
Corp.

In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron
common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron
shareholders will retain their existing shares.  The exchange ratio
represents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing
stock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18%
premium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25%
premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during
the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron
shareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco
shareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an
enterprise value of more than $100 billion.

The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent
(BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and
operations throughout the world.  In the U.S.,  ChevronTexaco would be the
nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1
million BOE per day, and hold the nation's third largest reserve position,
with 4.2 billion BOE of proved reserves.

Note:  This article gives some of the strategy and economics of the purchase 
of Montana Power by Pan Canadian.  
We will look at the Oklahoma reserves for location and strategy with our 
pipe--with the switch in ownership, they may be 
receptive to strategy changes.

PanCanadian Says Montana Power Purchase 'Beautiful Fit'

To extend what it sees as dominance in Canada's natural gas market and to 
boost its production by 10%, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. yesterday agreed to 
purchase Montana Power Co. for $475 million. The properties will extend 
PanCanadian's existing shallow gas properties in southern Alberta into 
northern Montana, adding 94 MMcf/d and 3,800 barrels of crude oil and natural 
gas liquids. 

The acquisition will give PanCanadian properties in Alberta, Montana, 
Colorado, Oklahoma and Wyoming, along with three gas pipelines linking 
Alberta and Saskatchewan to Montana. 

"We have a focus on natural gas," said CEO David Tuer during a conference 
call yesterday in Calgary. "This is clearly our future. It is difficult to 
put any negative on this (acquisition) and it's likely to stay valuable for 
the foreseeable future." 

Montana Power's production is more than 90% natural gas and associated 
liquids, and the acquisition substantially extends PanCanadian's land and 
infrastructure, allowing it to use its technology and operating strategies in 
a region that extends along the Alberta-Montana border. 

"The Montana Power assets clearly fit our strengths and allow us to employ 
our expertise in developing long life reserves of shallow and medium depth 
natural gas," Tuer said. "The potential in these assets is significant, and 
over the next few years, we will add substantially to PanCanadian's daily 
natural gas production." 

Tuer said that the acquisition extends the company's dominance in shallow 
gas, and called Montana Power a "beautiful fit with PanCanadian's gas 
strategy, land position and technological capability." 

PanCanadian's newest acquisition adds reserves of 550 Bcf and 20 MM barrels 
of oil and natural gas liquids on a proven and one-half probable basis, said 
officials. Production and reserves account for $520 million of the purchase 
price, while the remainder is made up of $135 million for the midstream and 
marketing assets, $40 million for the undeveloped land (about 600,000 acres), 
and $7 million of working capital. 

Tuer said the company was paying 77 cents/Mcfe of proven and on-half probable 
reserves. The price for daily flowing production, based on a 6:1 ration of 
gas to BOE is $4,450/Mcfe, or $26,710/BOE. 

Along with the added Alberta and Montana properties, PanCanadian also picks 
up some land in Colorado's Denver Basin, which now produces about 31 MMcf/d. 
Other land that is part of the sale is located in the Anadarko Basin of 
Oklahoma and the Green River Basin of Wyoming. 

Three natural gas pipelines that cross from Montana into Alberta and 
Saskatchewan also are included. The pipelines allow direct access to the U.S. 
markets for southern Alberta and Saskatchewan gas, and serve more than 1.2 
million net acres of developed and undeveloped lands, with most of it 
concentrated in parcels that span the Canada-Montana border. 

Midstream assets that go to PanCanadian include a natural gas marketing 
company in Butte, MT, along with a deep cut gas processing and fractionation 
plant in Colorado. The Fort Lupton, CO plant processes more than 60 MMcf/d 
and 5,500 barrels of natural gas liquids and condensate. 

In all, the total developed and undeveloped land is roughly 1.2 million net 
acres, or 1.7 million gross acres, said PanCanadian. 

"Montana Power fit us like a glove," Tuer said during the conference call. He 
said the acquisition will help PanCanadian to remain "best of class" for what 
it does. "It makes our sandbox that much bigger." 

The acquisition, which is expected to close around Oct. 31, will increase 
both PanCanadian's net income and cash flow this year and in subsequent 
years, said Tuer. The added gas production will immediately increase the 
company's natural gas, as a percentage of total production, to 58%, based on 
a 6:1 ratio of gas to BOE. 

About 25% of the natural gas being acquired from Montana Power now is being 
sold to Montana Power utilities for $1.50 to $1.60 MMcf until July 2002, and 
because it's priced below the open market officials think future earnings 
will be good. 

"As that contract expires, there's a lot of potential from the price in this 
transaction," Tuer said. 

And what's to become of Montana Power? Earlier this year, the 88-year-old 
company, headquartered in Butte, announced it would divest itself of four of 
its traditional energy businesses. By selling its coal production, natural 
gas transmission and distribution, independent power production and oil and 
gas exploration and production businesses, it plans to reinvest the proceeds 
in Touch America, a fiber optics and telecommunications business, which is 
also a subsidiary of Montana Power. 

"The process to determine the buyer for our oil and gas business was robust, 
and we are delighted with the result," said Montana Power CEO Robert P. 
Gannon. "We believe there will be a meshing of business strategies and that 
cultural synergy's exist between the purchased companies and Pan Canadian." 
He noted that Montana Power has had a Canadian presence for almost 50 years. 

PanCanadian purchased the entire oil and gas division, which now employs 
about 170. PanCanadian plans to maintain a regional office in Butte, invest 
in the acquired properties and grow daily gas production. There was no word 
on whether any jobs would be lost.

Aquila Signs Long-Term Deal with APEA

Aquila Energy said it has been awarded a $550 million long-term contract to 
supply 154 Bcf of natural gas over 12 years to members of the American Public 
Energy Agency (APEA). It is the fourth contract the agency has awarded to 
Aquila since 1998. 

"With the future of gas prices becoming more and more unknown because of 
increasing demands and tightening supply, our members will benefit greatly 
from this long-term contract," said Roger Mock, president and chief executive 
officer of APEA. 

Under the three previous contracts with APEA Aquila is supplying the agency 
with 14.4 Bcf of gas over ten years, 91 Bcf over 12 years and 141 Bcf over 12 
years. All together, Aquila is providing APEA with more than 400 Bcf over the 
next 12 years. 

APEA provides a reliable supply of natural gas to many municipal utilities 
and other public entities throughout the United States. These public buyers 
serve thousands of homes and businesses. 

"Our strategy is to provide our customers with the most effective portfolio 
of services, both financially and physically, to enhance their competitive 
position in managing their energy needs," said Tom McCarthy, vice president 
of structured transactions for Aquila Energy.

Note:  The track record for WSI seems to have been better than the CPC for the past few winters.  

Breaking News : posted Dec 4, 11:50 AM
WSI Predicts Warmer-than-Normal Winter for Major Population Centers 
A warmer-than-normal winter is expected in the major population centers along the East Coast and Florida as well as the Southwest, while cooler-than-normal weather is predicted in the Plains, Great Lakes states, Pacific Northwest and the coastal sections of California, according to WSI Corp., which issued an end-of-November update to its seasonal forecast. 
For the marketplace, WSI said the winter 2001/2002 outlook "paints a less bullish picture for the December-January period in the Northeast -- compared to last year's frigid, record cold temperatures that sent natural gas and power prices soaring." This winter by contrast should be milder and "much less volatile." 
WSI expects the following monthly trends: 
December: Warmer-than-normal temperatures across the East Coast states, the Gulf Coast states and parts of the Southwest. Cooler-than-normal in the northern and central Plains and most of the western half of the country. 
January: Warmer-than-normal over most of the country, with the exception of the southern Plains, which includes Texas and Oklahoma. 
February: Sharply cooler temperatures in the northern two-thirds of the United States including the Northeast. Major cities along the California coast also will be cooler than normal. Warmer-than-normal in the Southwest, southern Plains and Southeast. 
"The expectation of warmer-than-normal temperatures in the major cities in the East is different from the CPC (Climate Prediction Center) outlook, in which no forecast was made for the East," said Todd Crawford, WSI's seasonal forecaster. 
WSI was one of the few services to accurately predict a warm November in the Northeast and the United States overall, and its three-month seasonal forecasts have been accurate for seven of the last eight periods, it said. WSI issued its season weather advisories twice monthly.

CMS, DEFS Swap Strategic Properties

In a strategic move said to benefit both midstream energy companies, CMS 
Field Services Inc. has swapped some of its natural gas assets in Oklahoma 
and Kansas for some of Duke Energy Field Services' similar assets onshore and 
offshore Louisiana. 

DEFS' natural gas gathering and condensate measuring and transportation 
assets onshore and offshore Louisiana were exchanged with CMS Field Services' 
assets in Oklahoma and Kansas, giving each company more proximity to their 
other assets. The deal closed Dec. 20 and was announced Friday. No financial 
details were disclosed. 

"This transaction makes both strategic and economic sense for CMS Energy," 
said Tim Young, senior vice president of the field services division. In 
1999, CMS Energy acquired Duke Energy's Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Co. and 
Trunkline Gas Co., and Young said the swap gives CMS more opportunities to 
offer enhanced services to "existing and potential shippers" on CMS-owned 
properties along the Gulf Coast. 

In the deal, CMS obtained 10 offshore gas gathering laterals, a one-third 
ownership in the Atchafalaya Pipeline System and complete ownership in a 
Patterson, LA condensate measuring facility. The 10 offshore gas gathering 
laterals are connected to two offshore pipelines owned by CMS Energy: the 
Trunkline Gas Co.'s Terrebonne system and the Sea Robin Pipeline Co. The 
39-mile-long Atchafalaya Pipeline receives condensate from the Terrebonne 
system, while the Patterson measurement facility measures condensate 
transported through the Atchafalaya pipe. 

In return, Denver-based DEFS, a subsidiary of Duke Energy and Phillips 
Petroleum, obtained two Midcontinent natural gas gathering systems: the 
Bradshaw system in Kansas and the Roaring Creek system in Oklahoma. DEFS also 
will pick up the Miles Hampton and Ulysses systems in Kansas and the 
Christmas Lateral in South Texas. 

"These assets are a great strategic fit with our assets in the area, as they 
will specifically supply to plants with existing capacity," said Michael 
Bradley, senior vice president, DEFS' northern division. Bradley said the 
asset exchange supported the company's growth strategy "optimizing and 
rationalizing assets" and giving the company more flexibility. 

CMS Field Services supplies regions of Louisiana, the Texas Gulf Coast, West 
Texas, Central Texas, the Midcontinent and the Rocky Mountains, and owns 
approximately 5,000 miles of gathering pipeline. DEFS, 70% owned by Duke and 
30% by Phillips, operates in 11 states and across five of the largest natural 
gas producing regions in North America. It owns and operates 71 plants and 
57,000 miles of pipe, with operating territory extending from western Canada 
to the Gulf Coast.

Calpine Announces Development of 600-MW Energy Center

Calpine Corporation announced that through a development agreement with Adair 
International Oil 

and Gas, Inc. it has secured the rights to develop, build, own and operate a 
600-MW natural gas-fired 

electricity generating facility near the town of Thermal in Riverside County, 
CA. The $275 million Teayawa

 Energy Center will be located on the Torres Martinez Desert Cahuilla 
Indians' land through a long-term 

lease agreement between Calpine and the Torres Martinez. 

Construction of the project may begin as soon as mid-2001, with commercial 
operation slated to begin in 

late 2003. The project will interconnect with an existing transmission line 
adjacent to the property. 

As the power project is located on Native American land, the lead permitting 
agency under the National

Environmental Policy Act is the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
Additionally, BIA approval is necessary 

to ensure that the Teayawa Energy Center appropriately meets the cultural, 
environmental and economic 

considerations of the Torres Martinez.

Transportation Notes

Projecting that linepack would slip below its minimum target level through 
Thursday, Pacific Gas & Electric issued a systemwide Stage 3 OFO, effective 
today until further notice. The order carries penalties of $5/Dth for 
negative daily imbalances exceeding a 3% tolerance. 

As a result of warmer area weather and banking on its system, Northwest said 
it is operationally feasible to loosen conditions of its entitlement for 
delivery points north of Kemmerer (WY) Station. A Declared Stage II (8% 
tolerance) Overrun Entitlement will take effect today; through Tuesday the 
pipeline was in a Stage I (3%) Entitlement. A shipper is subject to penalties 
for overtakes north of Kemmerer that exceed an amount 8% greater than its 
confirmed nominations. 

El Paso will take the B turbine at Cornudas Station in West Texas down for 
maintenance today and Thursday, reducing South Mainline capacity there by 60 
MMcf/d. However, Cornudas capacity has not been fully utilized recently, the 
pipeline said, so this reduction should not affect current markets. 

The Kinder Morgan pipeline group (NGPL, Kinder Morgan Interstate, 
Trailblazer, Canyon Creek, KN Wattenburg and TransColorado) reminded shippers 
it has a new 24-hour hotline phone number for information and questions about 
point confirmations and related issues: (713) 369-9683. The old hotline will 
stay in service through Dec. 31, but callers will hear a recording giving the 
new number. The current number for nomination-related issues, (713) 369-9670, 
is not changing, Kinder Morgan said.

El Paso Merchant Ordered to Relinquish Data

FERC yesterday ordered El Paso Merchant Energy to stop stonewalling and turn 
over protected materials to parties involved in a complaint case in which 
it's alleged the affiliate received preferential treatment when it acquired 
1.2 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

Specifically, the Commission denied El Paso Merchant's request for rehearing 
of a June 2000 order that granted in part the discovery sought by the 
California Public Utilities Commission, and rejected rehearing of a September 
protective order. The latter directed El Paso Merchant to make available to 
all intervening parties, who agreed to the terms of the protective order, all 
of the materials that were being submitted to the CPUC and FERC in the case. 

So far, El Paso Merchant has refused to release the information to these 
parties, claiming the materials being filed with the CPUC and FERC are for 
"Government Eyes Only." It also argues that the protective order offers 
inadequate protection of commercially sensitive information. 

The Commission disagreed. "El Paso Merchant has not substantiated or 
sufficiently justified its broad claim that all of the 'protected materials' 
provided to CPUC and this Commission warrant the designation 'Government Eyes 
Only.' Indeed, all of the information that El Paso Merchant seeks to 
shield...relates directly to the issues," the order said [RP00-241]. Also, 
FERC finds that the protective order provides "sufficient protection for El 
Paso Merchant's commercially sensitive documents." 

The CPUC brought the complaint last April. It is seeking to abrogate the $38 
million contract arrangement between El Paso and El Paso Merchant. The agency 
alleges the affiliate was given "preferential treatment" by El Paso during 
the open season for the capacity, and thus the contract arrangement should be 
declared void. 

The CPUC and others contend the contract arrangement, which awarded more than 
one-third of El Paso's capacity rights to the California border to El Paso 
Merchant, is largely responsible for the high natural gas and electric prices 
in the state. They have urged FERC to "act immediately" on the merits of the 
complaint, but the Commission has yet to do so.

Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
"The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market," FERC said in its draft order. "Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate." 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, "given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California." 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was "extremely successful," adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
"The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States," said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
"We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region," said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
"Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent," said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. "We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.''

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

This is CERA's Western Market forecast for November.

*********************************************************

Rather than enjoying a respite, western energy markets will make November
a catch-up month. Natural gas demand will remain high when compared with
the same period last year, as gas-fired generation will continue to run at 
high
utilization rates and market participants try to restore gas storage to normal
levels. The tight supply situation will maintain upward pressure on gas
prices, which will range from $5.15 to $5.83 per million British thermal
units, depending on location. Refueling outages at three nuclear units, along
with a seasonal decline in hydroelectric output, will maintain gas-fired
generation on the margin for most of November. On-peak power prices will
remain higher as a result, in the $86-$98 per megawatt-hour range,
depending on location.

**end**

Note:  CERA is forecasting a weaker economy and weaker demand for power
and gas this year.


Subject: Western Energy--Power and Gas Prices and Volatility Expected to
Fall - CERA Monthly Briefing 



Title: Demand, Prices to Follow Trajectory of the Economy 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2702;


***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--POWER AND GAS PRICES AND VOLATILITY EXPECTED TO FALL

CERA expects a weaker US economy to be one of the outcomes of the tragic events 
on September 11, 2001, which will further reduce the demand for gas and power. 
Spot prices for natural gas and power already reflect this expectation, and 
CERA's outlook anticipates continued price weakness. 

*  As new supplies continue to arrive over the next year, even as demand 
weakens, the West will have more than adequate supplies of gas and power.
 
*  This surplus supply situation will put additional downward pressure on 
prices.

*  The shift from supply tightness to the recent plunge in prices can be traced 
principally to the rapid decline in demand for both gas and power this year, 
while supplies grew.

Due to a compressor failure at its Riner Station, Williams declared a force 
majeure situation on 
Line Segments 490 and 491. Necessary repairs are expected to be completed by 
next Monday's 
gas day. Since capacity in the two segments has been reduced, maintenance 
originally scheduled 
for the week of Aug. 21 at the Cheyenne and Ogallah Stations will be done 
this week to minimize 
disruptions during August, Williams said.

El Paso declared an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Thursday that 
will remain in effect until further notice. The pipeline said it will limit 
scheduled volumes at underperforming interconnects to insure system 
integrity. 

Likely in response to the A/BC border constraint that began Thursday due to 
maintenance on the TransCanada-British Columbia Line, NOVA changed its 
imbalance tolerance range to +2%/-18% Wednesday. Reflecting the resultant 
shift in supply accessibility, neighboring Westcoast has a +20%/0% tolerance 
in effect.

Note:  Most people have probably seen the announcement on the sale of TransCanada Gas Marketing (Cibola and other operations) to BP unit.  There are a few additional details in this announcement.  LB
TransCanada Sells Gas Marketing, Trading To BP 
Following through on a cost-cutting initiative begun in 1999 under another CEO, Calgary-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. on Friday said it has reached an agreement to sell some of its natural gas marketing and trading operations to BP Gas & Power. Included in the sale is CanStates Gas Marketing, a contract to manage gas supply assets for SEMCO Energy Gas Co., and the marketing and trading operations in its Omaha, NE office. Financial details were not disclosed. 
The sale, expected to close in the fourth quarter, is part of a long process first begun in 1999 by then-CEO Doug Baldwin, who told investors to expect C$3 billion of the company's C$26 billion in assets to be put on the auction block by the end of 2001.  Earlier this year, TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas transporter, said it would exit the natural gas marketing business to focus on its core natural gas transmission and power businesses in Canada and the northern tier of the United States.
Of the latest cuts, CEO Hal Kvisle said the company was "progressing toward a complete exit from the natural gas marketing and trading business. Our carefully managed exit from this business is one more step toward achieving our goal to be the strongest and most profitable competitor in our core businesses of natural gas transmission and electric power." 
Kvisle said he was "excited about the prospects for our natural gas transmission and power business," adding he expected to see "significant growth and value creation in regions where we have strong competitive advantages." TransCanada still has several marketing assets for sale, including most of its gas transport and storage contracts, lease arrangements for marketing offices in Toronto and Montreal, and a business that markets aggregated supply from more than 500 Canadian gas producers. 
TransCanada's network of 38,000 kilometers of pipeline transports most of western Canada's natural gas production to Canada and the United States. It owns, controls or is developing approximately 1,900 MW of power generation.

Title: A Colossal and Dangerous Failure
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2185


Overview: WESTERN ENERGY=01*CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR STAYS THE COURSE
California governor Gray Davis provided his strongest public statements to=
=20
date regarding the state=01,s power crisis in his annual State of the State=
=20
Address on January 8, 2001. Echoing many of his previous positions on what =
he=20
perceives as a flawed and unfair California market structure, the governor=
=20
labeled the state=01,s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous=
=20
failure. Among other actions, he launched new initiatives valued at $1=20
billion to encourage conservation, provide financing and land to new=20
generators, grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of=20
transactions to manage electricity costs, and increase regulatory scrutiny =
of=20
existing market suppliers. The governor also called for a greater role for=
=20
the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants.

The governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the=20
steps necessary to put California on the road to recovery. Details regardin=
g=20
sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming. Although he=20
stated that California=01,s investor-owned utilities must not be allowed to=
 go=20
bankrupt, no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given. The financi=
al=20
community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provid=
e=20
financial backing for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California=20
Edison. At this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to=
=20
guarantee their solvency.

The governor again criticized the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for=
=20
what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the=
=20
wholesale market. Merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the=20
state, and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their=
=20
operations, jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid. New, more sever=
e=20
sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting wh=
at=20
investigators find as unreasonable profits.

A Los Angeles Times poll released the morning before the governor=01,s addr=
ess=20
indicated that the majority of Californians still do not believe there is a=
n=20
energy crisis. Although the 33 percent growth in the state=01,s economy ove=
r the=20
past ten years has nearly outstripped the state=01,s and surrounding region=
=01,s=20
supplies of power, the bulk of the governor=01,s statements continue to foc=
us on=20
the culpability of power producers, rather than the serious supply shortfal=
l.

Though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the constructio=
n=20
of new generating plants, increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of=
=20
sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers=
=20
and the financial community that the investment climate in California is=20
excessively risky.

PNM to Buy Electric Utility Operations of Western Resources

Public Service Company of New Mexico and Western Resources said that both
companies' boards of directors approved an agreement under which PNM will
acquire the Western Resources electric utility operations in a tax-free,
stock-for-stock transaction. Under terms of the agreement, PNM and Western
Resources, whose utility operations consist of its KPL division and KGE
subsidiary, will both become subsidiaries of a new holding company to be n
named at a future date. Prior to the consummation of this combination, 
Western Resources will reorganize all of its non-utility assets, including
its 85% stake in Protection One and its 45% investment in ONEOK, into 
Westar Industries which will be spun off to its shareholders.

Based on PNM's average closing price over the last 10 days, the indicated
equity value of the transaction is approximately $1.503 billion, including
conversion of the Westar Industries obligation.  In addition, the new
holding company will assume approximately $2.939 billion of existing Western
Resources' debt, giving the transaction an aggregate enterprise value of
approximately $4.442 billion.  The new holding company will have a total
enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion ($2.6 billion in equity; $3.9
billion in debt and preferred stock).  The transaction will be accounted for
as a purchase and is anticipated to be immediately accretive to PNM's
earnings per share and cash flow.

Enron's Lay Urges Bold Solutions to Power Market Woes

As the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission prepared to weigh in this morning 
with the federal government's answer to California's be-deviled power market, 
free market advocates issued last minute warnings against taking the price 
cap route espoused by the Cal-ISO. FERC's meeting is scheduled to start at 9 
AM EST. (Check http://intelligencepress.com this morning for updates) 

In a letter fired off to FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker yesterday, Enron CEO 
Kenneth Lay urged the Commission to find a fix for the underlying structural 
problems in the power market rather than follow the steps of policy makers 
who have placed "price cap 'band aids' over hemorrhaging wounds." 

Lay told Hoecker the power market is "halfway across a busy street in its 
transition from monopoly to competition. It can't stand where it is." He said 
FERC has to make a choice between falling into the "same trap of political 
expediency as California's ISO, leaving the nation's electric system in the 
lurch from one crisis to the next, [o]r it can take a big step toward 
fundamental structural reform." 

At the same time the Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA) called on FERC 
to issue an emergency cease and desist order prohibiting the Cal-ISO from 
"unilaterally implementing" any changes to its current $250/MWh price cap for 
wholesale electricity purchases. In a motion filed Monday, the marketer group 
specifically asked the Commission to bar the Cal-ISO board of directors from 
putting into effect its decision to impose a fiendishly complex 
load-differentiated price cap of $100 or less during the off-peak season 
effective Nov. 3. The plan was designed by the state's main utility consumer 
group (see Daily GPI, Oct. 30). In addition, the EPSA urged FERC to "state 
explicitly" that the Cal-ISO does not have the authority to impose or extend 
price or bid caps, unless expressly authorized to do so by the Commission. 
The Cal-ISO's current authority to set price caps expires on Nov. 15. 

Lay said the Cal-ISO's complicated new formula caps prices below the cost of 
gas-fired generation, "making obvious errors such as failing to take into 
account gas transportation costs between the Henry Hub and power plants in 
California; in doing so the bid cap makes it more economic for generators to 
sell their gas supply, rather than use it to make electricity in California." 
The new formula also forces the ISO into the market to buy power on an ad hoc 
basis "to keep the lights on when the capped market fails to attract 
sufficient supplies (which it inevitably will do)," Lay said. In addition, 
the capped formula "invites generators to shut in production, export power 
out of state and deploy their turbines in other states or countries." 

He noted that the ISO's Chairman voted against the measure while all of the 
state's utilities voted for it "presumably knowing full well that it simply 
will not work." 

California is "just the latest failure of partial or compromised open 
access," said Lay. "It's time for the Commission to reject this approach. 

"The power industry --- the nation's most essential industry --- is mired in 
the transition from regulated monopoly to open access and customer choice. 
Every step forward has been compromised out of concern for alienating one 
vested interest or another. As a result, utilities are free to slow the 
interconnection of new generation, withhold equal access to the transmission 
system, favor their own sales over those of competitors, miscalculated 
available transmission capacity, and exercise control over supposedly 
'independent' system operators and reliability organizations. 

Lay predicted that installing price caps for political expediency would 
"plunge markets into greater uncertainty and discourage new supplies and 
conservation methods..." 

FERC has to complete the work that it started, said Lay. It has to ensure 
that all parties have equal and fair access to transmission by "ending the 
special priority for utility uses of the system. Second, FERC must require 
transmission owners to separate operation of the monopoly transmission assets 
from their other businesses. Third, FERC must take politics out of 
transmission system operations by revising governance structures to ensure 
independence. Finally, FERC must end its reliance on shortsighted price caps 
by putting in place the necessary reforms to allow these markets to operate 
efficiently to encourage conservation and attract new supplies." 

EPSA said the Cal-ISO board "acted in obvious disregard for the Commission's 
orderly processes." It "cannot be permitted to make the Commission's 
decisions for it, or to alter so radically market rules, thereby injecting 
more uncertainty and confusion in the market and subverting the process for 
fashioning fair, effective and comprehensive remedies" for California's 
"flawed" electric markets, the group noted. 

The EPSA believes that any remedial actions taken by FERC with respect to the 
California markets will be "severely compromised" if the Cal-ISO board's 
imposition of new prices caps is allowed to take effect.

Subject: California on the Brink--CERA Alert




CERA Alert: December 13, 2000 

Title: California on the Brink 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Western Energy, N. American Power, N. American Gas 

CALIFORNIA ON THE BRINK 
The California Stalemate 
California moved closer to the brink of an outage today as concerns over 
credit-worthiness of buyers brought the possibility that generators would 
avoid selling to the California market. While numerous factors have 
contributed to the high cost of power incurred by California's utilities, the 
root cause of the current crisis is a lack of new generation. The current 
credit crisis and its threat to supplies could spark state action to address 
the situation. The collective efforts of all market participants should be 
focused on increasing generation capacity as quickly as possible.

Western power prices have skyrocketed well beyond the record levels set this 
summer. Perhaps because frozen rates insulate the majority of California 
consumers and companies from tangible effects of the market crisis, 
regulators have been able to postpone meaningful market reforms and 
significant rate increases. The California Public Utilities Commission denied 
the requests of Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison to end 
their rate freezes, forcing these utilities at least temporarily to finance 
the costs of higher wholesale energy. This has created an unsustainable 
accumulation of costs and a loss of faith in the California market. 

The current credit crisis and the potential for blackouts may become the 
galvanizing events that provide state regulators with a public mandate to 
address the underlying structural problems in the industry. However, there is 
no guarantee that these regulatory actions will expedite an effective 
solution for customers and the industry as a whole. Wholesale and retail 
markets that emerge from regulatory intervention are likely to remain 
muddled. In the necessarily political process that will follow, it is 
possible that-as has largely been the case so far-the steps taken will fail 
to move the California power market toward a more enduring solution and will 
instead continue to mask the underlying structural flaws. 

In the six months since California's supply shortfall began plaguing Western 
markets, regulators have done little to address the underlying problem. 
Rather than addressing the cause of the supply shortage-establishing a market 
environment that encourages timely additions of new generating capacity and 
demand side responses-efforts are instead directed at trying to lay blame for 
the crisis and lessen the immediate financial impact on customers. Indeed, 
several actions taken thus far have served more to compound the problem by 
discouraging new power plant additions. These include price caps, repeated 
changes to market rules, attempts to seize generator profits, and a 
challenging siting and permitting process.

Medicine Worse than the Illness 
Several years of electricity demand growth and low prices in California were 
accompanied by very few additions to the supply base. Regulators did not pay 
adequate attention to the looming supply shortfall. The void of consensus 
over the cause of the current crisis has instead been replaced by a series of 
bandaid remedies that address the symptoms, but not the cause, of 
California's electric market woes.* 

* Challenging siting and permitting. Despite state action to better 
coordinate the siting and permitting process for new power plants, power 
plant developers still face high hurdles. Local community opposition alone 
has struck down some key proposed facilities.

* Price caps discourage investment. State and federal proposals to cap prices 
limit the attractiveness of the California wholesale power market, especially 
for developers who have the option of channeling scarce capital and equipment 
to more stable or more attractive markets outside the state. 

* Repeated rule changes. Frequent rule changes in the ISO markets (including 
the price caps) confound attempts by developers to estimate profits from new 
plant development.

* Calls for refunds. Despite reports by the Power Exchange, the ISO, and the 
FERC that no pattern of abuse could be found from their examination of the 
California markets, state officials continue to accuse power providers of 
gaming the market. Calls by state officials for refunds of generator profits 
are a threat to new plant development.

* Facility inspections. Recent inspections of power plants by state officials 
to verify that operators are honestly reporting the operational status of 
their generating units accentuates the atmosphere of mistrust.

CERA's recent analysis suggests that merchant plant developers in the West 
are not guaranteed? to make a profit. Prospects of new plant profitability 
are affected by the timing and quantity of new plants, decommissioning of 
older units, demand growth, and numerous other difficult-to-forecast factors. 
California's regulatory actions only further cloud the assessment of 
financial viability and degrade the political environment for developers 
considering entering the state. 

Despite efforts by the California ISO to stimulate new capacity additions in 
the state with a special, limited-term capacity payment, CERA estimates that 
demand growth will continue to outstrip supply additions in the West in 2001. 
In addition, the existing siting and permitting process will prevent a 
sufficient quantity of capacity from entering the market until 2003 at the 
earliest. Therefore, three years remain before a sufficient quantity of 
capacity enters service to significantly dampen prices and decrease the risk 
of an outage. 

The Road to Recovery 
There are a number of actions that can be taken to help relieve the capacity 
shortfall: 

* Encourage new build. Supply must be part of the answer. This requires a 
series of steps that can help facilitate new supply build. While in principal 
some have been taken, such as new fast track approval, the success of these 
actions can only be measured by the build itself. For now, there is still not 
enough new supply coming on until 2003 to relieve supply tightness.? 

* Stabilize investment climate. Utilities must have assurance that they will 
ultimately be allowed to recover market costs for power. This provides the 
credit worthiness needed by sellers to produce energy and to stimulate new 
build.

* Move toward more balanced utility supply portfolios. One of the reasons the 
pressure on customers has been so intense in California has been the absence 
(and even discouragement) of diverse supply portfolios among the utilities in 
the state-particularly for residential and small commercial customers. With 
the market at a peak, however, now is in one sense a sub-optimal time to move 
toward term contracting. Yet these contracts provide the foundation for a 
series of actions-including new supply build and demand side investments. If 
they end up above market, they will at least have achieved the desired effect 
of knocking down prices, a fact which by itself should provide sufficient 
justification for recovering the cost of these commitments.

* Encourage market mechanisms that elicit a demand response. Although 
originally a feature of California's market design, most consumers are 
insulated from price spikes through capped or frozen retail rates. Exposing 
customers to at least some of the market price signals would encourage a 
demand response.

* Encourage market mechanisms that dampen the "Boom Bust" characteristic of 
the market. Whether in the form of a capacity payment, a reserve requirement, 
or a minimum term portfolio requirement, the California power market needs to 
move to a structure that encourages investment in new capacity when the 
market is in balance rather than waiting for a shortage and price shock to 
elicit new investment. Such a structure can help dampen (but not eliminate) 
future price volatility.

* Avoid continuously tinkering with the market. While the market does need to 
be restructured as described above, it also needs to be stable and reliable 
to encourage the development of new supply as well as a robust long-term 
contractual market for power in California. Continually tinkering with the 
market structure-such as the three times the price cap has been shifted since 
July-only serves to undermine confidence in the market. California needs to 
do its best to develop a long-term solution and then let the market run its 
course. 

* Allow for greater environmental flexibility. The state should explore a 
more balanced solution to emissions restrictions in the face of a supply 
shortfall that has been exacerbated by generators that cannot operate due to 
emissions restrictions. 

* Free PURPA power plants to generate. Relief should be granted to PURPA 
power plants that are operational, but are restricted by contract from 
operating to generate only power.

Storage injections of 71 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Octobe=

Is this inventory level "enough"? Not yet. Storage inventories this winter=

under 15-

growing imports will add approximately 1.0 Bcf per day to supplies this=20
winter,
holding withdrawals down requires both of the following:

* Industrial markets--mainly ammonia and methanol
producers--that are now shut down because of high gas prices
must remain shut down. These markets represent
approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of demand that could return,
should gas prices moderate relative to ammonia and methanol.

* The nearly 1.5 Bcf per day of switchable load now burning

In CERA=01,s view, for gas prices to fall below resid on a sustained basis,=

particularly
as power loads increase this winter, it must become apparent that winter=20

Title: The West: Keeping Its Fingers Crossed
Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Western Energy ,

A strong dose of summer weather in June propelled West-wide demand levels up 
by nearly 12 percent over the same period in 1999. These higher demand levels 
provided the year's first example of the power price spikes that can be 
produced when the West's tight capacity intersects with normal summer load 
levels, lower-than-normal hydroelectric levels, strong gas prices, and 
California's immature wholesale power market structure. As power markets 
reacted in June with unprecedented price strength throughout the region, 
regulators and the California Independent System Operator (ISO) intervened to 
dampen markets from a maximum of $750 per megawatt-hour (MWh) to $500 per 
MWh.* Although some market participants have filed protests at the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to raise or eliminate the caps, utilities, 
legislators, and consumer advocates are moving to protect consumers or 
completely redesign what they perceive as a flawed market.

As western markets move through the critical July-August peak electricity 
demand period, market participants and regulators alike are wondering if 
power supplies will be sufficient and if price levels will rival those in 
June. CERA expects that western supplies will be adequate under normal summer 
weather conditions, barring abnormal unit and transmission line outages. 
However, normal August weather conditions will push demand levels 
significantly higher than in June, creating an even tighter supply-demand 
balance, straining the ability of the transmission system to supply key 
demand regions adequately. A hot weather event could exhaust both in-state 
and imported supplies for California.

The tight supply and demand situation will almost certainly prompt a strong 
price response, similar to that in June. This will fuel the unease of 
regulators in states that have restructured their markets and in those that 
are considering restructuring. Even as regulators' continued support of 
restructured power markets begins to waver, a weather event that forces 
regional blackouts would force regulators to intervene.

CERA's outlook for August power markets is driven by
* High peak loads. Under normal weather conditions, West-wide August loads 
will be on average 1,400 megawatts (MW) higher than last August. The peak 
load in California is expected to push capacity margins to 6 percent, even 
after curtailing interruptible load.

* Lower hydroelectric output. As the West enters its peak load period, 
hydroelectric production is expected to decline systemwide by roughly 3,900 
average megawatts (aMW) from July to August. Compared with the high, 
sustained output of last August, hydroelectric output this August, although 
roughly average on a historical basis, will be roughly 4,900 aMW (20 percent) 
lower.

* High levels of gas-fired generation. Compared with August 1999, higher 
utilization rates, along with gas prices that have climbed $1.88 per million 
British thermal units (MMBtu), will increase the incremental cost of energy 
production by over $20 per MWh. Although CERA expects power prices in August 
to diverge from production costs owing to the expected supply tightness, 
higher production costs will create a higher floor for energy prices in all 
periods of the day.

The extremely tight power supply-demand balance within the West, and within 
California specifically, has resulted in unprecedented high summer gas demand 
for power generation. This high demand level-combined with seasonal storage 
injection needs in California-has pushed up utilization rates on pipelines 
into California and pushed Topock differentials over $0.75 per MMBtu to the 
Henry Hub. Strong demand should continue through August in the West and 
support premium pricing at Topock.

The Rocky Mountains represent the opposite extreme to the high premium placed 
on Topock deliveries. In the Rockies supply is building relative to export 
pipeline capacity, and market access is becoming a challenge. Weak seasonal 
demand compounds the problem; the strong western demand for gas for power 
generation does not extend to the Rockies. Generation within the region 
remains nearly all coal-fired. These regional pressures should remain a 
feature of western gas markets through September.

Moderate summer weather and reassuring injection rates nationwide during 
recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices at the Henry Hub. However, 
summer is not yet over and absolute storage inventories are still at critical 
levels. Higher gas prices are likely to resurface.

Regional Power Market Drivers
August demand under normal weather is expected to rise by an additional 7 
percent, or nearly 5,500 aMW, over average June levels (see Table 1). Peak 
demand levels should exceed those in June as well, with a coincident peak 
over the whole Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) of 118,600 MW 
expected under normal weather conditions in 2000, a 2.7 percent increase over 
the weather-muted 1999 peak. California alone should experience peak loads 
that are approximately 3,600 MW higher than peak levels in June.

Available generation capacity in the West has been at normal levels for this 
time of year, although coal-fired plants are responding to a record 
production year with repeated but short-lived outages. The steady decline in 
hydroelectric generation will remove 3,900 aMW from the West resource base 
when compared with July levels and about 6,800 aMW since June, although 
reservoir refilling operations temporarily removed significant quantities of 
hydroelectric generation during portions of June. Given hydro operators' 
economic interest in maximizing on-peak production at the expense of off-peak 
production, the loss of capacity during the on-peak period will be lower than 
these levels.

August will be a critical month for the heavily import-dependent state of 
California. While the state will be drawing approximately 7,000 aMW of 
imports during August to meet demands during peak periods, CERA expects the 
level of imports to exceed 8,200 MW during peak demand conditions. The 
Southwest's need to supply native demand first will limit its ability to 
export to California, and lower year-over-year hydroelectric production in 
the Pacific Northwest will limit exports from that region.

Pacific Northwest
CERA expects Pacific Northwest demand in August to climb by nearly 1,300 aMW 
when compared with June levels. The water supply for the Pacific Northwest 
has declined to 91 percent of normal levels for the Lower Columbia owing to 
warmer-than-normal weather in June. In addition, normal seasonal decline in 
runoff levels will drop about 6,000 aMW from the resource base when compared 
with levels in June (see Table 2). Generation plant operators have responded 
to both growing native demand and a robust export market by running coal and 
gas-fired generation at high levels. Although less than 4,000 MW of gas-fired 
generation is currently available in the region, it has been running at high 
utilization rates.

High energy demand in California for Pacific Northwest energy will keep 
differentials low between the regions. As in June, Pacific Northwest prices 
will respond in kind to the volatility CERA expects to occur in California in 
August. In addition, if hot weather in the Pacific Northwest pressures 
regional energy reserves, local prices will rise to keep energy in the 
region, potentially causing prices in the Pacific Northwest to move higher 
than those to the south.

California
California is entering the peak load season with relatively little generating 
capacity down for maintenance. Although hydroelectric output continues to 
decline, statewide reservoir storage levels remain high at roughly 118 
percent of normal. Nevertheless, declining hydroelectric production is 
expected to remove about 730 aMW when compared with hydroelectric production 
levels in June.

Normal summer weather will push demand in the state up by about 3,600 aMW 
over June levels, which were high (see Table 3). California's peak load is 
expected to exceed 57,000 MW, compared with a peak load in June of 
approximately 53,500 MW (43,447 MW on the state's ISO system alone, according 
to its own estimate). Assuming normal plant outage rates, this demand level 
will necessitate the import of about 8,200 MW of energy to meet the statewide 
peak. Even after curtailing the approximately 2,800 MW of interruptible load 
available for tight supply situations, the state has a precarious 6 percent 
capacity margin during the system peak. An extreme hot weather event could 
push state loads up by an additional 3,000 MW. Outages are likely if 
additional imports are not available.

A capacity limit of 4,600 MW will be in place during the summer for energy 
exports from the Pacific Northwest to Northern California. The import limit 
from the Pacific Northwest to southern California will be 3,100 MW.

Rockies and Southwest
August demand levels in the combined Rockies/Southwest region will increase 
only slightly above levels in August 1999, climbing approximately 275 aMW, as 
loads in the region-unlike the rest of the below-average WSCC-were near 
normal last August. Even so, August loads will increase demand by over 1,250 
aMW when compared with levels in June of this year. As with last year and 
this June, supplies in the region should be sufficient to meet peak demand 
conditions under normal weather, although growing loads in the 
Rockies/Southwest region have reduced its ability to supply neighboring 
regions with energy during peak demand conditions.

High loads driven by hot weather will keep the region's prices high. 
Differentials between the region and California will be tight, but 
California, having tighter supply-demand balances, will need to price at a 
premium to attract energy. The high-capacity transmission ties between the 
Rockies/Southwest and the California market, which is about 150 percent the 
size of the Rockies/Southwest market, will ensure that prices in the 
Rockies/Southwest stay close behind California prices whenever loads are high 
in California.

Regional Gas Market Drivers
Evidence of pipeline bottlenecks has emerged across the West, and supply and 
demand forces over the next year look likely to intensify these pressures. 
Since the Northern Border expansion in late 1998, narrow north-south and 
east-west differentials across pricing points defined the market. This 
summer, the continuing supply growth in the Rocky Mountains has widened 
differentials between the Rockies and the rest of the West. At Topock, 
increasing gas demand in California and high utilization rates have resulted 
in high premiums.

Overall in North American gas markets, strong storage injection rates in 
recent weeks have allowed some easing in prices-from an early July Henry Hub 
price of $4.50 per MMBtu to under $4.00 per MMBtu. However, despite these 
high injection rates, the supply-demand balance and absolute level of storage 
inventories remain precarious. Summer is not over and higher nationwide power 
loads in weeks to come will likely cut into storage injections and boost 
prices. The ongoing competition between power and storage for supply should 
support an average Henry Hub price of $4.20 per MMBtu in August.

Through the end of the summer, differentials in the West should hold near 
current levels. The pressure of growing Rocky Mountain supply will continue 
until heating loads start climbing in the fall. In California high seasonal 
power loads should continue through August with hot weather and continued 
declines in hydroelectric generation. Demand strength is expected to 
continue. Across the West, August demand for gas should climb from 9.8 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day in June to 10.4 Bcf per day, buoyed by an 
increase in gas demand for power generation (see Table 4).

California
High gas demand for power generation within California will continue through 
August. CERA expects an increase from the state's June demand levels of 5.6 
Bcf per day to 6.2 Bcf per day during August. The increase stems from 
declines in hydroelectric generation and increases in overall power loads. 
Total demand is expected to exceed last year's demand level by 1.2 Bcf per 
day. This will increase flows on pipelines into California, reduce the 
state's storage surplus, and sustain high prices. CERA expects pipeline 
utilization rates during August to average 95 percent (see Table 5). CERA 
expects an August Topock-Henry Hub differential of $0.45 per MMBtu (see Table 
6).

Pacific Northwest
Despite the extremely high prices at Topock and high demand in California, 
until recently gas at Malin priced at a slight discount to Henry Hub prices. 
After averaging $0.17 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during the third quarter 
last year, the differential so far during the third quarter this year is 
$0.15 per MMBtu below the Hub. This week Malin is pricing at a $0.25 per 
MMBtu premium relative to the Henry Hub. The Topock-Malin differential has 
swelled to over $0.60 per MMBtu, signaling intra-California pipeline capacity 
constraints. Two factors pressured Malin differentials during the early 
summer.
* Pressure on Rocky Mountain and AECO differentials. Prices in the two areas 
supplying the Pacific Northwest are under some pressure. Increasing supplies 
in the Rockies are beginning to reach the limits of export capacity and put 
downward pressure on Rockies prices by limiting external market access. At 
AECO, although export capacity out of the province is available, almost all 
of that excess capacity accesses eastern Canada on TransCanada Pipeline. 
Pipelines into the United States are running near capacity. Because of 
TransCanada's limited ability to discount interruptible transport, the 
available space is more expensive and therefore the last to be filled.

* Low early summer regional demand. Gas demand in the Pacific Northwest is 
limited during late spring and early summer by declines in heating loads and 
very strong hydroelectric output. Even in a normal or dry hydroelectric year, 
seasonal runoff holds down gas demand for power generation in May and June 
even as gas demand for power generation begins climbing in California. 
Increasing power loads are already evident.

The first factor will likely endure until heating season begins in late fall 
and regional demand in the Rockies and western Canada begins climbing. 
However, gas demand for power generation in the Pacific Northwest has 
increased already this summer and will continue to climb through the end of 
July and into August as hydroelectric generation wanes. This added demand-200 
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day above June demand levels-will provide some 
support for Malin prices and limited support for Rockies and AECO prices. 
Malin-Henry Hub differentials are expected to average $0.05 per MMBtu above 
the Henry Hub price during August.

Rocky Mountains
Pressure on regional supplies within the Rockies continues as exports out of 
the region reach new highs. Differentials to the Henry Hub have widened to 
over $0.70 per MMBtu and although prices in the rest of the West will gain 
some support from high power loads, regional demand in the Rockies is 
expected to remain near low seasonal levels through August. August demand is 
expected to average 1.2 Bcf per day in the region, approximately equal to 
June's 1.1 Bcf per day total demand. Demand begins to build during September, 
but until the heating season begins in October, Rocky Mountain prices will 
lag well below prices in the rest of the West. CERA expects a Rocky 
Mountain-Henry Hub differential of $0.60 per MMBtu during August.

Although some narrowing in Rocky Mountain differentials looks likely as 
seasonal demand increases through the fall, the rapid build in supply in the 
region will likely keep differentials wide during 2001. CERA expects a supply 
build this year of nearly 300 MMcf per day, followed by a build of over 350 
MMcf per day during 2001. Currently, approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess 
pipeline export exists out of the region, with the largest increment on 
Transcolorado into the San Juan Basin. Next summer, all capacity will likely 
run close to full. Until export pipelines expand-the first likely expansion 
is Trailblazer-differentials will remain wide. For 2001, CERA expects an 
average annual differential below the Henry Hub of $0.65 per MMBtu.

Southwest
Differentials in the San Juan and Permian Basins have gained considerable 
strength relative to Henry Hub prices amid the recent hot weather in Texas. 
Permian supplies are pricing at a slight premium to the Henry Hub price, and 
in the San Juan Basin prices have narrowed from an early July differential of 
$0.35 per MMBtu to a differential of less than $0.20 per MMBtu. CERA expects 
demand in the Southwest during August of 1.4 Bcf per day, an increase from 
June's level of 1.3 Bcf per day, but the larger Texas market will determine 
the relative strength of differentials in those two basins. CERA expects a 
San Juan differential of $0.30 per MMBtu during August, with a Permian Basin 
differential of $0.06 per MMBtu.

Differentials between the Rocky Mountains and the San Juan Basin have widened 
substantially over the past two months with supply increases in the Rocky 
Mountains. Flows on Transcolorado increased from a monthly average of under 
20 MMcf per day to over 100 MMcf per day during June. Supply in the two 
regions is following opposite paths; Rockies supply is climbing rapidly, and 
San Juan supply has likely peaked and should decline slowly beginning this 
year. CERA expects a decline in supply of 30 MMcf per day during 2000 
relative to 1999 and an additional decline of 150 MMcf per day during 2001. 
Because of these different outlooks, wider Rockies-San Juan differentials 
will persist.

El Paso Proceeding with NM Pipe Integrity Testing

El Paso Natural Gas has received approval from the U.S. Department of 
Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) to conduct more internal 
inspections on its rebuilt New Mexico pipeline, which ruptured August 19 
killing 11 people (see Daily GPI, Aug. 22). Since the explosion, flows 
through the line, which runs from West Texas to California, have been reduced 
to 85% capacity, or about 920 MMcf/d. 

OPS said the El Paso line has already been repaired and put through 
hydrostatic testing, which it passed. Hydrostatic testing checks for cracks 
by forcing high-pressure water through the line. Now El Paso has the green 
light to begin smart pig testing, which will examine the internal integrity 
of the line. The device, called a pig because of the sound it makes during 
inspections, has sensors and once placed inside the line, it can detect 
dents, deformities and changes in wall thickness. 

Neither OPS nor El Paso released a timetable as to when the pigging would 
occur or how long it would take. However, once the testing is completed, the 
results will be evaluated by OPS, which then would determine if the line were 
safe for commercial use. 

OPS has not issued actual regulations on smart pig use, but they have become 
increasingly sophisticated and more widely used. Even though hydrostatic 
testing can actually detect certain flaws that are invisible to smart pigs, 
the pigging process is considered a complement to the water testing and 
ensures more integrity in test results. 

OPS requires all pipe to undergo at least one hydrostatic test after 
construction. Although not mandated, OPS also has proposed requiring 
pipelines that transport liquid petroleum products to use direct assessment 
methods such as pigging to evaluate the pipeline's integrity. Other types of 
inspections include using magnetic particles or ultrasound to measure the 
pipe wall's thickness.

Home Heating Costs to Soar this Winter

     Americans can expect home heating prices to jump as much as 44%
this winter because of strong economic growth and high crude oil
prices, according to the EIA. A winter with especially long periods
of cold weather' could cause even higher prices because heating fuel
storage levels are below average. Homes that use natural gas can
expect to see the biggest jump in bills. Prices paid by residential
customers are expected to average $8.58 per MMBtu, up about 30% from
last winter's average of $6.61. The higher prices, combined with
increased consumption, will push overall costs up to an average $780
this winter from $540 last year earlier, the EIA said in an annual 
report on winter fuels. High prices for competing petroleum-based
fuels will help keep natural gas prices high. Homes with heating oil
will pay about $949 for fuel this winter, up 25% from the $760  paid
last winter. Prices will average about $1.37 per gallon, up 16% from
last year's $1.18, the report said. The 4.5% of Americans who use
propane to heat their homes will pay about 27% more this winter at
$1,045, compared with $823 last year. Inventories of propane at the
end of last month were about 62 million barrels, 3 million above last
year's level. Distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil and
diesel fuel, will be about 114 million to 118 million barrels at the
start of the heating season, about 15% to 18% lower than last year,
the report said. The government projection excludes the heating oil
reserve created by the Clinton administration, which stores 2 million
barrels. Distillate stocks in the East Coast are 41 million barrels,
close to 40% less than last year's level. In New England stocks are
over 60% below the 1999 level. The EIA estimated the monthly price of
crude oil will remain above $28 per barrel for the rest of the year,
and then gradually decline next year to an average $25 per barrel.
Because of rising demand in Asia and continued growth in the US,
higher oil production by OPEC has not been able to stem the rally in
prices, the report said. US crude oil inventories are about 287
million barrels, 17 million barrels below last year. The deficit is
smaller than last month, when there was a 26 million-barrel
shortfall, though supplies are still 8% below normal and are not
expected to move into the normal range before the end of winter, the
report said.  Global oil demand this year is expected to increase 1.1
million barrels per day from last year and will grow by an additional
2 million barrels a day in 2001 to 78 million barrels a day,
according to the report. The average retail price for gasoline, which
was about $1.52 per gallon last week, will fall to about $1.46 per
gallon in December and $1.40 by next March, the report said. The
report says a very cold winter could cause Northeast heating oil
prices to surge, and that could spill over into East Coast diesel
markets. The government said the chances of this were greater this
year because of tight distillate supplies, especially in the
Northeast. Diesel prices will fall by about $0.09 to $1.55 per gallon
in December and $1.35 by next summer, assuming normal conditions this
winter.

Kinder Morgan Transfers $300M in Assets to MLP

Kinder Morgan, Inc. announced plans to contribute $300 million in assets to 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P., the company's master limited 
partnership. The largest asset to be contributed is Kinder Morgan Texas 
Pipeline, formerly MidCon Texas, a 2,600-mile natural gas pipeline system 
that extends from South Texas to Houston along the Texas Gulf Coast. 

Other assets include the Casper and Douglas Gas Gathering and Processing 
Systems, KMI's 50% interest in Coyote Gas Treating and KMI's 25% interest in 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. As consideration for the assets, KMI will receive 
$300 million, 50% in cash and 50% in KMP partnership units. KMI expects the 
transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter. 

"This transaction represents a true win-win for both KMI and KMP," said 
Kinder Morgan CEO Rich Kinder. "It is expected to be accretive to cash 
available for distribution to KMP's unitholders by between 5-10 cents in 
2001. The pipeline assets are a good fit for KMP because they complement 
existing KMP assets, have long-term contracts in place and offer significant 
growth opportunities." Kinder noted that because the mix of consideration 
paid will include equity issued to KMI, it will not be necessary to raise 
funds for the transaction via a public offering of KMP units. 

"KMI will also benefit from the transaction, as it will be able to reduce its 
debt by $150 million," Kinder said. "Additionally, the transaction is 
expected to be modestly accretive to KMI's earnings per share in 2001. By 
increasing its stake in the master limited partnership, KMI will enjoy 
greater participation in the expected future growth of KMP." 

Upon closing, KMP will have completed in excess of $600 million of 
acquisitions in 2000. In addition, this transaction will boost KMI's total 
asset contribution to KMP to more than $1 billion, far exceeding the original 
goal stipulated when Kinder Morgan merged with KN Energy last July.

FERC Approves North Baja Pipe 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday voted to approve the proposed North Baja Pipeline which will deliver 500 MMcf/d of natural gas from a connection with El Paso Natural Gas near Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas distribution systems and new power plants in northern Mexico and Southern California. 
The U.S. line, which is being built by PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group, would extend 80 miles to border-crossing facilities near Yuma, AZ. It is expected to cost about $146 million. The Mexican government already has issued a transportation permit to Sempra Energy International to build the 135-mile Mexican portion, Gasoducto Baja norte, to Mexicali, Baja California. 
FERC's approval came after the FERC staff, and the staffs of the California State Lands Commission and the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management issued a favorable final environmental impact statement. The Commission already had issued a preliminary determination, approving all non-environmental aspects of the project. 
If the project "is constructed as modified and in accordance with [North Baja 's] proposed mitigation and our recommendations, it would be an environmentally acceptable action," the staffs of the three agencies concluded in the final environmental impact statement (FEIS) on the pipeline (CP01-22). 
The pipeline could be delivering gas to the first of two new power plants in Mexicali as early as mid-summer. Work has been underway for some time on the longer, Mexican portion of the line which runs from Yuma, AZ, near the Mexican border to the Rosarito Beach area south of Tijuana in the northwest corner of Baja.

Subject:=09WSJ Article on Enron/Portland General Sale to Northwest Natural

Northwest Natural In Talks With Enron Over Portland Utility=20
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters Robin Sidel, Rebecca Smith and Nikhi=
l Deogun 10/05/2001

 The Wall Street Journal B2 (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)=
=20
Enron Corp. is in advanced discussions to sell its Portland General Electri=
c utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $1.8 billion in cash =
and stock in a highly leveraged transaction that would eventually give Enro=
n a minority stake in Northwest, according to people familiar with the matt=
er.=20
The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points nee=
d to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also=
 make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn'=
t a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could b=
e announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to ass=
ume roughly $1 billion in debt.=20
Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment.  If a transaction is consu=
mmated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agree=
ment to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell=
 apart in part because of the California energy crisis.  A purchase of Port=
land General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a ma=
rket capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more t=
han 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Was=
h. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million cu=
stomers in Oregon.  The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whos=
e executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwe=
st's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating office=
r of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. =
 By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in=
 its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when price=
s are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people fami=
liar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is s=
omewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transa=
ction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in N=
orthwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the t=
ransaction with debt and equity offerings.  Shares of Northwest Natural wer=
e trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York St=
ock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10.  For E=
nron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-yea=
r ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break=
 into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility busines=
s proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selli=
ng off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And Ca=
lifornia's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less =
attractive place for Enron to do business.  Enron, which also owns a major =
gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and busine=
sses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of phys=
ical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere.  It isn't clear where Enr=
on will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadban=

Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility 
Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
"We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT. For more information about the project and the terms of the open season, go to web site www.coppereagleGS.com <http://www.coppereagleGS.com> or telephone Russ Kovin at (832) 676-5659.

*********************************************************

Western Markets Disconnect
The western energy markets are currently in a pricing
crisis. Power supply shortages and threats of system
blackouts have resurfaced this winter in California, and
spiking natural gas prices have become the latest energy
headache for the West. Gas prices along the Pacific
corridor from Kingsgate in the North to Topock in the
South have jumped to over $40.00 per MMBtu during
December after averaging over $15.00 per MMBtu through
the second half of November. Extreme weather, strong
power demand for gas, and unusually low gas storage
levels have combined to intensify the demand for
pipeline gas and have exposed a latent capacity
bottleneck in bringing gas to this far western corridor.
The result is prices that dramatically "disconnected"
from the rest of the North American gas market in a way
that is more typical of Northeast markets during the
winter.

The vulnerability to additional spikes will endure as
the demand drivers combined with weakened storage
inventories will maintain price pressure on western
price points throughout the winter. However, the recent
jumps in western gas market differentials-to more than a
$10 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub-should ease
somewhat with a break in the weather. Under any weather
scenario, spikes up into the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu
range will be a feature of winter markets along the West
Coast. On balance, we expect West Coast price
differentials to average at a $4.00-$8.00 per MMBtu
premium through winter. The spring hydroelectric runoff
season should offer the first opportunity for a break in
differentials that could drop back to more typical
levels of less than $1.00 per MMBtu.

Over the long term, increased pipeline capacity and
additional gas supply are needed to break the
vulnerability to future West Coast price spikes.
However, significant new capacity additions are still 12
to 24 months away. In the meantime-particularly this
winter-sustained high and volatile price differentials
and extremely high absolute prices at western points are
likely to draw the increased attention of state
regulators and the FERC, as winter heating demand
exposes residential customers to the direct cost of the
crisis.

Building Up to the Price Spike
The first signs of natural gas price spikes and
disconnects emerged this summer, as sharp year-over-year
increases in demand pushed pipeline utilization rates to
new highs. As pipeline capacity constraints into
California became evident, differentials in Southern
California moved up to a $1.00 per MMBtu premium to the
Henry Hub. These extremely high prices, as well as low
forward spreads, discouraged storage injections through
the summer. As a result, a strong storage position early
in the summer deteriorated rapidly from May through
July. In August a lateral on El Paso's southern system
exploded; the accident further limited pipeline capacity
into California for a two-week period. During that time,
the market drew heavily on storage inventories and
further weakened storage positions. As hydroelectric
generation declined through the summer, the price
strength extended into Northern California. Malin, which
had been pricing near parity with the Henry hub in the
summer, began trading at a $0.50 per MMBtu premium to
the Henry Hub in September. The summer and early fall
market set the stage for continued and more intense
spikes this winter. The following factors are now
driving this market:

* Continuing surges in gas demand. Gas demand levels
have remained high since early summer, driven by higher
overall demand for electricity and lower hydroelectric
output. Demand levels for the third quarter in the US
West averaged 10.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day, up
from 8.7 Bcf per day during the third quarter 1999.
Persistently strong gas-fired generation production
through the fall months diverted gas to power
production, frustrating efforts to fill storage. This
pressure will continue. The year-over-year demand
increases from the power sector will be compounded, as
evidenced in November, by swings upward in residential
and commercial heating demand of 800 million cubic feet
(MMcf) per day. Overall, CERA expects nearly 1.6 Bcf per
day of increased demand in the West this winter, with
the critical California and Pacific Northwest regions
showing 1.2 Bcf per day of increased demand. Key power
sector drivers, including the strong economy, colder
weather, and lower hydroelectric generation, will
continue to push gas-fired generation.

* Pipeline utilization nears capacity. Strong western
demand for gas has pushed utilization rates on western
pipes to high levels. Flows from British Columbia into
the Northwest pipeline have remained at high levels
since summer, while flows from the Rockies on Northwest
have remained at pipeline capacity. Flows on PGT into
Kingsgate have remained at or near capacity, although
approximately 300 MMcf per day of excess capacity exists
on PGT into California at Malin. Likewise, flows out of
the Rockies on Kern River pipeline have consistently
remained at capacity. The only slack pipeline capacity
remaining for West Coast gas markets has been on
Southwest pipes. During the past few months, these
pipelines have operated at their highest utilization
rates since the addition of capacity from Canada early
last decade. The high utilization of western pipeline
capacity-reminiscent of power plant capacity constraints
that helped propel power prices to all time highs in the
West this summer-leaves very little slack capacity to
provide a relief valve for demand spikes. And that is
exactly what has driven prices during the past few weeks
(see Figure 1). Given the level of storage inventories
and expected gas demand, flows on the El Paso and
Transwestern pipelines will have to reach even higher
flow levels from December through March than they have
averaged through November.

* Deteriorating storage position. At the start of
November California storage inventories held at 154 Bcf,
a full 32 Bcf below the five-year average inventory
level. The strong in-state withdrawals during November
weakened that position to 128 Bcf; the deficit swelled
to 62 Bcf. Inventories in California have never fallen
below 60 Bcf, so deliverability through the end of
winter is likely less than 700 MMcf per day. Storage
inventories in California are so low that utilities'
ability to balance withdrawals from storage with
purchases from demand-sensitive price points is severely
limited. If the cold weather blast anticipated for mid-
December materializes, this effort at balance will be
even further compromised for the remainder of winter
(see Figure 2).

* Short-term contracting. A significant amount of
western gas is purchased or indexed to the spot market.
A shift from term contracts for both gas and pipeline
capacity to spot transactions-in many cases in response
to gas and power industry deregulation-has left the West
much more exposed to spot market volatility. In other
areas of the country, utilities have significant firm
pipeline capacity extending from supply regions to the
citygate and/or have forward purchased gas (at previous
and lower prices) for at least some portion of their
winter supplies. As a result, unlike in eastern markets,
a much larger proportion of the supply portfolio of
California utilities will be exposed to the current
price spikes.

* No alternatives. A lack of fuel-switching capability
prevents a meaningful demand response to higher gas
prices. Power prices continue to move in lockstep with
the increase in gas prices. Not surprisingly, gas prices
pushed the cost of gas-fired generation beyond the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC's) proposed
price cap of $150 per megawatt-hour, setting the stage
for a reassessment of this price limit. A small and
declining portion of power generators are liquid fuel
capable. Significantly, air emissions restrictions-
already plaguing power markets with much higher
emissions credit costs this year-will make any further
switching to liquid fuels in the crucial California
market highly unlikely this winter. A recent meeting of
the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which
has jurisdiction over the Los Angeles area, concluded
with no relief granted to generators running short of
emissions credits.

Market Forces Unite for Price Spikes During November
The first cold weather-related demand spike demonstrated
the combined power of these forces and the vulnerability
of the western markets. A cold weather system in mid-
November brought temperatures averaging 47 percent
colder than normal-the temperatures actually averaged 14
percent colder than a normal January week-and provided
the additional demand boost that taxed the gas delivery
systems on the West Coast. Capacity constraints on
moving gas into California that appeared during the
summer extended north into the Pacific Northwest as
heating loads climbed. This core demand compounded the
effects of continued strong demand for gas for power
generation.

The high power demand was the result of the intersection
of the annual low point for hydroelectric generation and
a series of planned and unplanned nuclear and coal power
plant outages. Gas demand in the US West during the last
two weeks of November was boosted to approximately 15.5
Bcf per day, driven by heating demand increases of 2.8
Bcf per day above normal levels and power plant outage-
related demand increases of 1.0 Bcf per day.

These demand spikes caused buyers-already dependent on
the spot market-to bid citygate prices to record high
levels through the last two weeks of November and into
December. Since demand outstripped supply, prices rose
dramatically at all western price points, and flows of
natural gas to western markets increased over high
summer levels. Citygate prices surged beyond $40.00 per
MMBtu on daily spot markets and averaged nearly $15.00
per MMBtu for December bidweek at Topock. Daily spot gas
prices have reflected imbalance penalty prices in many
western market regions.

West Coast to Remain Disconnected Through the Winter
Although the week of November 13 could prove to be the
peak demand week in the West this winter, CERA does not
expect any significant retreat in gas prices on the West
Coast any time soon. Storage inventories are so low that
the ability to beat back demand spikes with high storage
withdrawals is not an option for gas utilities.
Generators, which already rely heavily on the spot
market for supplies, are faced with a bidding war for
scarce supplies. Colder-than-normal weather would likely
keep West Coast prices in the $20.00-$40.00 per MMBtu
range. More normal weather would allow a slow decline
from current levels of over $20.00 per MMBtu down into
the $15.00-$20.00 per MMBtu range. However, the storage
situation and underlying demand strength mean that any
return to a lower pricing range is unlikely until early
January.

This winter will prove a critical test for western gas
markets, and the end of the heating season will likely
provide the first opportunity for lower price levels in
the West Coast market. As heating loads diminish
significantly in March and storage deliverability is no
longer a critical issue, premiums should retreat back
into the $1.00-$2.00 per MMBtu range. As hydroelectric
generation begins to increase, the pressure could
subside even further, but storage injections during the
spring shoulder season will likely limit price declines
even during the spring.

The Unique Vulnerability of the Pacific Northwest
The West Coast price pressure is not limited to
California. High demand in the Pacific Northwest (and
more indirectly in California) will keep upward pressure
on prices from Sumas to Stanfield. Northwest pipeline
capacity from the Rockies was already fully utilized at
the onset of the cold weather and even so can only
provide gas so far into the Pacific Northwest. The
combined California and Pacific Northwest demand pushed
Stanfield up in spite of the limited volumes that are
bidirectional there. The only supply source for the load
centers in southern British Columbia and even more so in
northern Pacific Northwest (such as Seattle) are from
Westcoast at Sumas. The Westcoast mainline from the
producing fields in Northeast British Columbia has also
been operating at capacity. The same bidding forces felt
in California have been evident at these western
Canadian price points, pushing Sumas prices into the
$20s per MMBtu. These forces will persist, keeping Sumas
at a premium to AECO over the winter-and in much closer
relationship to California prices.

Customer Response:  Another Log on the Backlash Bonfire
With power plants and gas utilities paying the current
high spot prices, consumers' bills from Vancouver to San
Diego will ultimately reflect these high commodity
prices. The gas industry has been preparing for rate
shock this winter, warning regulators and customers
alike. However, the price spikes in the West and the
sustained premiums in western markets move beyond
alarming. Capacity holders are reaping significant
rewards for their investments in capacity positions,
resulting in a substantial transfer of wealth from
consumers to capacity holders. Market power and market
gaming accusations that have hit the power markets will
find easy application in their gas market counterpart
(no matter what their merits). Some level of
investigation into the natural gas markets during or
following this challenging winter should be expected. As
has occurred in the power markets, this will now turn
attention to gas purchasing practices, particularly in
California. The likely outcome of this process will be a
shift away from the heavy reliance on spot purchases
toward a more flexible portfolio approach.

Though this conference was scheduled to review all issues related to El Paso's capacity allocation method (including those in the pipeline's Order 637 proceeding), and with two complaints filed this summer regarding problems with the pipeline's allocation, major substantive issues were not covered at this conference.  For instance, the battle between Full Requirements (FR) shippers and Contract Demand (CD) shippers came up marginally, but not in terms as substantive as the proposed conversion of FR shippers to CD contracts.

Procedurally, there was also no decision on whether to proceed with a hearing, merits decision from the Commission or settlement, though it looks like a merits decision is the likely avenue for a decision.  Staff did not discuss case merits or ask pointed substantive questions.

Allocation Studies (Models)

El Paso opened the conference with a presentation/interpretation of seven capacity studies they have done to illustrate how its allocation proposal (March 27) would allocate the system's receipt and delivery points based on different scenarios.  For nominations, receipt and delivery points were specified and ranked by shippers, and the model used 20 pools.  The scheduling model looked at where constraints occurred (based on those shipper-supplied preferences), solved the largest constraints first, then ran second and third iterations to complete allocation.

There were questions on the studies, what they show, what the assumptions are, etc., and in the end shippers believe they need information not shown by the completed studies.  Shippers have requested six more allocation studies, showing possible impacts of seasonalization (winter and summer) and the difference between CD and Full Requirements Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks (winter and summer, 1995 - 2000).  

El Paso interprets its studies as showing that the proposed capacity allocation method is workable, and in fact results in 247 MMcf/d of unallocated capacity (230 MMcf coming from the Line 2000 expansion proposal, and an extra 17 MMcf).  Shippers were skeptical of the "slack capacity" finding.

Other Issues

?	Pooling: There was a small amount of discussion on the impact of moving from six to 20 pools.  It was noted that this should be addressed with Order 637 issues, expeditiously after capacity allocation method is resolved.

?	FR vs. CD: Though there were some FR vs. CD shippers discussions, they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by the TX, NM and AZ shippers (FR) and Aera Energy (CD shippers).  There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service.  Note: never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants' proposals that El Paso (1) dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or (2) requiring mainline system expansion for existing service (RP01-484 and 486).

?	Release shippers:  Shippers contracting for released capacity were concerned about how they would be allocated, as well as those shippers picking up turnback contracts from the pipeline (which would have receipt and delivery points already allocated).

?	Receipt Point Designation:  The question was asked if shippers could designate specific receipt points rather than pools.  When asked what Commission policy is on pools vs. receipt points, both shippers and Staff clarified that they are neither mutually exclusive nor to serve as substitutes for one another - both should be available.  However, Staff noted that in the flexibility vs. reliability debate, it could be argued that El Paso should return to receipt point designation to maintain reliability.


Procedure Going Forward

The primary issue here ended up being procedural.

The procedural schedule is as follows:
?	El Paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing:   Sept. 24
?	Initial comments (on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations): Oct. 15
?	Reply comments:  Oct. 26

FERC Staff Issues Favorable Draft Environmental Impact Statement on 
Guardian Pipeline

     The FERC Staff has issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement
determining that construction of Guardian Pipeline would have limited
environmental impact and would be an environmentally acceptable
action, based on its proposed and other mitigation measures. The
Draft covers the environmental aspects of constructing and operating
the 149-mile Guardian Pipeline. FERC will take written public
comments on the Draft until August 28th, and will conduct four public
meetings along Guardian's route starting August 14th. It will
address
the comments before issuing a final Environmental Impact Statement on
the project. A final decision on the Guardian Pipeline expected early
next year. The Guardian Pipeline will transport volumes from
interconnections with Alliance, Northern Border, Midwestern Gas
Transmission, and NGPL at the Chicago hub to northern Illinois and
southern Wisconsin markets. The project will consist of a 25,000
horsepower of compression and 141 miles of 36 inch pipeline extending
from Joliet to the Ixonia, WI, with an additional 8.5 miles of 16
inch pipeline extending from the main Guardian line to near Eagle,
WI.

Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment?
 
With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available 
supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent 
results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear 
Stearns analyst Robert Winters. 

With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you 
turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large 
power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards 
distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the "next big 
investment opportunity for the coming decade." In Winters' 250 page report, 
"Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries: 
Set for a Revolution-Part 2," he examines technologies and companies within 
the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage 
of the current situation. 

"Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of 
new investment in the power industry has just begun. We believe that this 
coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which 
flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in 
the early 1980's," said Winters. 

"Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of 
high quality, reliable power," added Winters. According to his research, 
microturbines are the best positioned of the "new" technologies that would be 
able to have an immediate impact on electric generation. 

He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet, 
efficient and very versatile. "They can be used as a main power source, a 
back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in 
traditional energy prices," the analyst said. "Microturbines can also be used 
in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access 
to electricity." Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel 
requirements. The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other 
fuels as well. 

In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and 
existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and 
Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback. 

In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed 
energy companies. He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering 
flywheel technology, as a "buy" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading 
manufacturer of microturbines, as "attractive." The companies are in addition 
to two fuel cell companies he currently follows. Ballard Power is currently a 
buy, and Plug Power is rated neutral.

Strong Demand Holds Load Factors High Despite Alliance

The introduction of the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline into the North American 
gas market appears to have had less of an impact on gas flows out of western 
Canada than expected, according to representatives of TransCanada PipeLines, 
PG&E Gas Transmission and Alliance. Extremely strong gas demand in the 
Pacific Northwest, California and in the Midwest has produced continued high 
load factors on TransCanada and PG&E GT-NW despite the presence of their huge 
new rival for Western Canadian supply. 

"The contract picture changed significantly on [TransCanada] since the first 
of November and primarily at our Empress, AB, delivery point into the 
TransCanada mainline from the Alberta pipe, but actual physical gas flows [at 
about 6 Bcf/d] have not changed correspondingly," said Klaus Exner, director 
of pipeline system operations at TransCanada. "The big picture overview that 
I would give you is that demand is very high in the Pacific Northwest and 
California and we continue to run at the highest possible load factor down 
that leg of our pipeline system out of Alberta, through British Columbia and 
into the PG&E systems. That hasn't let up at all and we don't foresee that 
letting up." 

PG&E Gas Transmission Spokeswoman Sandra McDonough said PG&E GT-NW has been 
running full at 2.6 Bcf/d for some time and is delivering 900 MMcf/d to 
non-California load in the Pacific Northwest. "We're turning back demand 
right now. Every power plant in this region is running full tilt. Tuscarora 
[Gas Transmission], the Nevada pipeline, is full. Our Northwest deliveries 
are fixed. We're delivering as much as we can deliver right now." 

TransCanada's other major export route out of the Western Canadian 
Sedimentary Basin is the Foothills and Northern Border route into the 
Midwest. It also continues to operate at high load factors. "We didn't see a 
huge drop-off in physical flows post Nov. 1. We've seen the IT volumes come 
up considerably," said Exner. "The one thing that has changed is the 
volatility of the flows. Customers are making frequent intraday nomination 
changes and we're seeing more up and down and day-to-day variations, 
according to the weather and the markets, than we would have when we had a 
higher firm contract level. The fluctuations are driven purely by the price 
differential between AECO and the Dawn Hub in Ontario, which indicates 
whether or not interruptible flow on the mainline is in the money or not." 

Alliance Pipeline spokesman Jack Crawford said the system has been running 
flat out at about 1.325 Bcf/d since the valves were opened for commercial 
service Dec. 1. He also said the pipeline soon would be testing to increase 
flows on the system. It has been estimated that Alliance could increase gas 
flows to 1.5 Bcf/d with existing compression. The additional capacity would 
be divided up among existing shippers, Crawford said. "We haven't cranked up 
the system above the contract capacity yet. We probably won't do that for a 
couple weeks until we get things ironed out. Frankly though, I'm not sure 
Chicago is their best market right now given the pricing in the Pacific 
Northwest and California."

Title: Monthly Briefing: In a High Range
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1314 ,

**********************************************************************

Gas prices remain within a high range, with prices volatile between 
approximately $3.75 and $4.50 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). 
Prices are likely to remain within this high band through the fall, until the 
uncertainty of early winter weather resolves itself. At the lower end of this 
range--and with oil prices in the upper $20s per barrel or higher--price 
support kicks in as end users begin to switch back toward gas or to 
reactivate industrial demand. Gas prices may flirt with the lower boundary so 
long as the weather is not too hot across too many regions, allowing storage 
injections to increase and providing hopes for an adequately supplied winter. 
Above-normal heat in only one or two regions, however, or even the threat of 
storms in the Gulf of Mexico will pull prices quickly upward. As for the 
upper boundary, although prices in specific regions such as California and 
the Northeast may reach above $5.00, an actual storm in the Gulf or more 
widespread heat than!
 has yet occurred this summer appears required to pull the Henry Hub much 
above $4.50.

Absent tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico, CERA expects prices to 
settle into the lower portion of this band during September (see Table 1). 
Although strong power loads and the resulting weak injection rates are likely 
to sustain prices through much of August, the seasonal decline in generation 
demand into September should allow storage injections to increase by 1.5 
billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day. As a result, CERA expects prices to settle 
somewhat, averaging $3.95 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub during September. 
However, the larger fundamental force in the market remains unchanged: 
supplies are adequate with any certainty only for another warm winter. Any 
interruption in supply or abnormal demand will quickly drive prices upward; 
next month may represent the low for the remainder of the year.

Gas Storage--Not Yet Enough

Mild weather over much of the United States during July allowed a much-needed 
recovery in storage injections, with the estimated injection rate increasing 
by nearly 2.5 Bcf per day from year-earlier levels (see Table 2). This rate 
was enabled entirely by lower demand, however, and not added supply. The 
result is that under more normal summer weather conditions during August, the 
US storage inventory deficit is likely to remain stubbornly near 350 Bcf. 
Although the deficit is likely to decline on average during August, it is 
even more likely to expand again during September, especially should any 
storm necessitate evacuation of offshore platforms. Absolute inventories and 
supply adequacy for this winter therefore remain a concern in the market.

Inventories are unlikely to reach levels adequate to prevent record lows from 
occurring next spring. Should injections continue as expected, inventories 
would reach approximately 2,750 Bcf by October 31; but reaching even this 
level, still an all-time low annual maximum inventory, requires some help 
from a lack of storm activity and a lack of heating load in October. Storage 
inventories are not yet sufficient to relieve market pressure and are 
unlikely to become so by the beginning of the heating season.

Regional Markets--Western Disconnects Continue

Wide differentials emerged this summer in the West and look likely to persist 
through September. In Southern California record summer demand levels have 
pushed pipeline flows to new highs. Topock continues to be the premium 
pricing point in North America. In the Rockies supply growth has pushed up 
pipeline flows out of the region. Power loads should ease somewhat in 
Southern California, and that easing will bring some decline in the Topock 
premium. Pressure on Rocky Mountains and San Juan prices should persist until 
the start of the heating season in late October (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:

*  Rockies. Pipeline capacity out of the Rockies is running nearly full to 
every export market except the San Juan Basin. Emerging pipeline bottlenecks 
should keep differentials wide during September, with an average differential 
of $0.75 per MMBtu.

*  San Juan. In the San Juan increased imports from the Rocky Mountains and 
high utilization rates on capacity into California are pressuring prices. 
CERA expects differentials to average $0.55 per MMBtu for the month of 
September. San Juan differentials will narrow more substantially when Rocky 
Mountain pipeline bottlenecks are relieved by increases in heating demand 
during the fourth quarter.

*  Permian and Mid-Continent. Strong power loads in Texas have supported 
Permian Basin prices during July and August. Persistent power demand is 
expected to keep differentials around $0.08 per MMBtu for September. 
Mid-Continent prices should average just under Permian prices.

*  Chicago. Steady storage injection loads are unlikely to support prices at 
Chicago in the face of declining power generation into September. July 
premiums of $0.06 to $0.07 have already come down in early August and are 
likely to remain low, at approximately $0.03 for September.

*  Northeast markets. Northeast price premiums have averaged from the 
mid-$0.20s to the mid-$0.30s, depending on generation load and proximity to 
the New York Facilities Group major meters. CERA expects little to change 
this relationship, but as generation loads decline into September, premiums 
could move closer to the fuel cost floor, the mid- to high $0.20s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Disappointing

Although June displayed year-over-year growth in production in western 
Canada, July reverted to a decline, and August is running close to last 
year's level. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in 
2000, approximately 9,200 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the 
trend toward shallow drilling does not change substantially, the sheer number 
of wells is expected to produce a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 
2000, the total western Canadian supply build is expected to be flat with 
1999, increasing to a positive growth of 350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up

TransCanada flows are down 275 MMcf per day on average for 2000 but have been 
down by over 350 MMcf per day so far in the third quarter. PG&E GT-NW volumes 
were up by over 300 MMcf per day in June and July but have dropped to 
year-earlier levels in August and are expected to remain close to last year's 
levels for September. Northern Border Pipeline is operating at rates similar 
to last year's on average in 2000 but is expected to decrease about 50 MMcf 
per day for the third quarter. Western Canadian demand is currently up 
slightly, driven by the warmer-than-normal weather in late July and early 
August, but should be closer to 1999 levels in September.

High Prices: Wide Differentials

The AECO-Henry differential has widened quite dramatically over the past few 
months from the low US$0.30s of the first quarter to US$0.84 in July. The 
differential increased to well over a dollar in the second week of August, 
but the driver for that increase was maintenance that reduced the export 
capacity at Empress. August and September are expected to average in the 
mid-$0.80s.

AECO is expected to average C$4.67 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.35 per MMBtu) for 
August, with September softening to C$4.53 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu) for a 
third quarter average of C$4.54 per GJ (US$3.25 per MMBtu).

In a November 17, 2000, CERA multimedia conference call and web presentation, 
Ed Kelly, CERA Director, and 
Bryan Sanderson, CERA Associate, discuss: 

WINTER WEATHER SCENARIOS: BRACING FOR THE STORM 
* Demand potential under cold, normal, and warm weather 
conditions this winter. A return to normal weather will 
push demand well above last year's levels. 
* Storage outlook. How low can it go? 
* Price. Limited demand flexibility and low storage 
levels will continue to drive prices through the winter.

El Paso Explosion Takes 500 MMcf/d Off Market

About 1 Bcf/d of flow on El Paso's South Mainline downstream of Pecos River 
(NM) Station ceased after the 
pipeline exploded early Saturday, killing 10 people and seriously injuring 
two others at a nearby campsite.

El Paso said Monday it was able to compensate for about half that volume 
through a combination of fuel 
switching by downstream customers, maximum storage withdrawals, an OFO and 
other customer cooperation. 

The market reaction was rather predictable as all three California points 
rose by about 35 cents to lead an 
overall price surge. However, utilities in the state did not appear to be 
experiencing any supply problems. 
SoCal Gas said storage and supplies from other Southwest receipt points were 
adequate to avoid any 
problems. A gas operations official for Los Angeles Dept. of Water and Power 
also saw no reason for panic. 
>From past similar incidents on Southwest pipelines, he expected that the 
approximately 80-feet-long section 
missing from El Paso's line could be "slapped back into place rather 
quickly." 

El Paso itself had no estimate for when it can restore service in the 
impacted segment; it must get approval 
rom the federal investigators before beginning repairs or evaluating a 
restart of the adjacent lines. But a large 
aggregator and a marketer agreed with the LADWP official that it should be "a 
quick mechanical fix" once 
repairs begin. The aggregator believed downtime could be as short as a week. 

No customers were cut off as a result of the rupture but some were getting 
reduced volumes, an El Paso 
spokeswoman said. 

Northern Natural Gas was seeing a throughput increase of 200-300 MMcf/d 
Monday while Transwestern 
volumes were up 50-75 MMcf/d as a result of shippers diverting gas away from 
El Paso's South Mainline, 
an Enron spokeswoman said. A producer said she diverted as much of her 
company's gas as possible from 
El Paso to Transwestern. 

People were reluctant to trade Permian Basin gas Monday, especially at fixed 
prices, because of doubts 
about how much would be able to flow, several sources said. Permian numbers 
rose a little less than 18 cents 
as part of the general upturn. However, it was Waha prices that saw a bigger 
increase of nearly 30 cents as a 
result. "Everything in El Paso-Permian's Keystone pool was going back into 
Waha," said a marketer, putting 
Waha in the mid $4.60s at a premium of more than a nickel above Henry Hub. 

The Southern California border, at an average of nearly $5.30, led the rest 
of Monday's market by a large margin. 
Before trading began, EnronOnline was offering border swing swaps for the 
rest of the month at $5.85-95, a 
marketer said. With swing swaps priced so high, it gave sellers more 
confidence in what prices they could 
command in the day market, he said. "Either way, I wouldn't want to be short 
right now at the border." 

There were lots of rumors but no facts available on what caused the El Paso 
rupture, noted one aggregator. 
"But it's a good thing it didn't happen until after California had cooled 
off. Otherwise I could easily have seen 
the border basis spread from San Juan Basin go as high as $2.50" instead of 
the approximate gap of $1.70 
egistered Monday by Daily GPI. 

A knowledgeable source provided his analyis of the blast: The structure of 
the crater made the rupture "look 
like a line integrity problem from the way it blew out." The earth can harbor 
leaking gas for a while until eventually 
everything all goes up at once. People nearby would not have detected 
anything because gas is odorless in 
long-haul lines; the mercaptan odorant is not added until it gets to the 
local distribution stage. Pipeline safety 
surveyors usually will look for dead vegetation in the vicinity to detect a 
leak, but this was a desert area with very 
little vegetation. It is easily possible for escaping gas to hug the ground 
for the approximate 500-foot distance to 
the victims' campsite and seek an ignition source there. It is a normal 
tendency for gas leaking into the atmosphere 
to stay close to the ground, and that tendency would have been amplied by the 
chilliness of the pre-dawn desert. 

The source went on to say, "I think there will be lot more of this [ruptures] 
in the future with many pipes becoming at 
least 40-50 years old." El Paso was unlucky in experiencing one of the early 
incidents, he said, because the situation 
applies to the other lines with old pipe. Pipelines used to spend a lot more 
money on maintenance when regulation 
was tighter and they were still paying for depreciation, he said. "Now 
they're more purely for-profit companies after 
having written off their [depreciation] costs many times over."

El Paso Blast Kills 10; Shuts Down South Mainline

Federal and company investigators Monday swarmed over the scene of the 
devastating El Paso Natural Gas 
mainline explosion that erupted near daybreak Saturday, engulfing a party of 
weekend campers along the Pecos 
River near Carlsbad, NM, and killing 10 people. Two other persons were 
hospitalized in critical condition. 

Three officials from the federal Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) and 11 with 
the National Transportation Safety 
Board (NTSB) have been at the site of the blast since late Saturday, and two 
more OPS officials were en route 
Monday. New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, who flew to the area on Sunday, said he 
wanted to know how many 
other potential pipeline "dangers" there are in the state. He called for a 
thorough investigation. 

About 1 Bcf/d of capacity on El Paso's southern leg initially was lost from 
the ruptured 30-inch line and two looped 
lines nearby that were shut in after the accident. El Paso was making up some 
of the shortfall by drawing the 
maximum, 200 MMcf/d from its Washington Ranch Storage Field downstream of the 
accident. Increased use of 
other pipelines, allocations and cutbacks by customers, and the fact that 
weather had moderated in California 
helped ease the supply situation. Nevertheless, spot prices increased by 
about 35 cents for points in California, 
while the rest of the market (spurred by Hurricane Debby) went up about 20 
cents. 

There was no estimate as to when the looped lines would be back in service, 
according to El Paso spokesperson 
Kim Wallace. 

"We don't intend to put anything back into service until we know for certain 
that the remaining pipelines are safe," 
Wallace said. She did not expect them to be back in service today, and could 
give no time frame on when they 
would be returned to service. 

It is "much too premature at this point" to predict when the three disabled 
El Paso westbound lines will return to 
service, said Patricia Klinger, a spokeswoman with the Department of 
Transportation's Research and Special 
Programs Administration (RSPA), which oversees the OPS. 

"The one that ruptured is definitely going to be out of service for awhile, 
and [another line] is badly damaged 
from the fire." As for a third adjacent line, that "could potentially be 
re-opened," but "we have to test the integrity 
of that line" and have it examined by metallurgists, she told Daily GPI. 
"Everyone will be working, of course, to 
try to get this [line] back in service. But the safe operation of the 
pipeline is of premiere importance." The three 
lines shared the same right-of-way. 

"We're just now able to start looking at exactly what happened, and how to 
get that one line back in service," 
Klinger said. "Our metallurgist is on his way right now. I know he's going to 
meet with the NTSB when they're 
examining the 50-foot section of pipe that's out of the ground" as a result 
of the explosion. "I think the company 
also wants to decide what types of tests can be done on this line. It's not 
piggable." 

The NTSB, which has set up a command center in Carlsbad, NM, declined to make 
any preliminary speculation 
about the cause of the explosion. "It's much too early for us to even think 
about the cause of this accident. We're 
only dealing with the facts...Right now, we're documenting the pipe itself 
and surveying the land. We're going to 
look at the chronology of when the [emergency] calls came in..... document 
damage to vehicles, and injuries," 
said NTSB spokesman Keith Holloway. 

"Probably at this point we're looking at nine months to a year, maybe more" 
before the results of the investigation 
are publicly disclosed, Holloway noted. 

The rupture occurred at 5:30 a.m. MDT in the underground line near the Pecos 
River crossing, which is about 30 
miles south of the Carlsbad Caverns National Park in a spot popular with 
local campers and fishermen. The blast 
tore a crater in the earth about 86 feet long, 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. 

According to preliminary reports, the pipeline was underground at the point 
of rupture, sending two sections of pipe, 
each about 20-feet long, flying hundreds of feet. The gas then ignited and 
shot flames from the broken pipe toward 
sleeping campers. The NTSB estimated there was a gap of 50 to 60 feet between 
broken ends of the pipeline at 
the site. The fire burned for about 40 minutes before El Paso workers 
manually shut off pipeline valves. 

Ten members of two families were burned to death in the blast. The families, 
who were related by marriage, were 
camping on public land along the river near where the pipeline emerged from 
the ground to cross the Pecos in an 
aerial crossing alongside a bridge. Six were pronounced dead at the scene and 
four others died at Texas hospitals 
Saturday night. The dead included five children under the age of six, 
including six-month-old twins. Two adults were 
listed in critical condition Monday at a hospital in Lubbock, TX. 

The ruptured pipeline, which El Paso said was constructed in 1950, is one of 
four that runs along the southern branch 
of El Paso's pipeline system. There is an adjacent 30-inch pipeline and 
another 26-inch pipeline. The fourth, a 
16-inch pipeline, was abandoned and is not available for service, Wallace 
said. El Paso and federal officials are 
particularly interested in the integrity of the second 30-inch pipeline that 
ran close to the broken line. 

Wallace said that none of the company's customers had been cut off of 
service, but they were receiving gas as 
reduced levels. 

She also said that on Aug. 2, a "patrol" inspection, either done by air or 
vehicle, was conducted on the pipelines 
located near the Pecos River by El Paso officials and no problems were found. 
El Paso conducted the last 
corrosion test in February and no problems were found then either. Visual 
inspections are conducted on all of the 
system's pipelines once a month, she said, and the company follows all 
federal pipeline requirements for inspections. 

Asked whether El Paso planned to change its inspection system immediately, 
Wallace said that she did not think 
so, but said that if the NTSB review finds something that needs to be 
changed, the company will do whatever needs 
to be done immediately. 

"These situations are so rare," she said. "We don't feel that we need to 
change what we're doing now. But if the 
situation warrants, we certainly will make any changes necessary." 

El Paso is working with family members to take care of their immediate needs, 
including hotel accommodations, 
food, travel arrangements and medical treatment. The company also is 
providing additional services as needed. 

"This is a tragic accident and our heartfelt condolences go out to the 
families involved," said El Paso Energy President 
William Wise. He said the company was working with the NTSB "to investigate 
diligently all matters surrounding this
 accident and to establish its cause as quickly as possible." 

The fallout of the explosion is expected to extend all across the country, as 
federal legislators consider more 
stringent pipeline rules following an explosion in Bellingham, WA, that 
killed three in June 1999. Locally, Carlsbad 
Mayor Gary Perkowski said that he wanted to find out what happened and keep 
it from ever happening again. 

That reaction was echoed by the New Mexico governor. "I have a lot of 
questions," said Johnson. "What is the 
reliability of these pipelines? What went wrong? Was it preventable?" 

Meanwhile, RSPA was sifting through its history to determine whether the El 
Paso blast was the biggest pipeline 
disaster on record in terms of fatalities. 

Timeline: 

5:26 a.m. Aug. 19: El Paso Natural Gas' automated computer reading of the 
pressure in the pipeline indicates 
673.5 pounds per square inch. 

Around 5:30 a.m.: An El Paso Natural Gas employee bow-hunting in the area 
sees a large fireball at the scene. 

5:30 a.m.: El Paso Natural Gas' automated computer reading of the pressure in 
the pipeline drops to 377.19 
pounds per square inch. 

5:30 a.m.: Carlsbad Fire Department responds to the emergency. 

6:12 a.m.: Carlsbad Fire Department arrives at the scene. 

6:21 a.m.: El Paso Natural Gas workers shut off the gas line using manual 
valves. 

Between Jan. 1 and June 30 of this year, there have been 40 transmission 
pipeline incidents, according to the OPS. 
Fourteen were caused by either external or internal corrosion; 11 were 
damaged by outside forces; three were due 
to construction or material defects; and 10 were unknown. There was only one 
fatality until June 30 of this year on 
transmission pipeline incidents, which was caused by an outside force. Eleven 
people had been injured through June. 

In August 1999, OPS sent a warning letter to El Paso, citing it for a number 
of pipeline safety violations in Arizona. 
The OPS did not impose a civil fine on El Paso, but it advised the pipeline 
that "should you not correct the 
circumstances leading to the violation, we will take enforcement actions when 
and if the continued violation comes 
to our attention."

El Paso Blast May Cinch Tough Pipe Safety Bill

The explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system, which killed 10 people over the 
weekend, may give Congress 
the added boost to pass a tough pipeline safety reauthorization bill when it 
returns from recess in September, 
Capitol Hill insiders said Monday. 

"This just sadly proves why Congress needs to act as soon as it returns [on 
Sept. 5] to pass the Pipeline Safety
 Improvement Act before any more innocent lives are taken," said a 
spokeswoman for Sen. John McCain (R-AZ). 

In June, Chairman McCain's Senate Commerce Committee voted out the Pipeline 
Safety Improvement bill that 
would, among other things, give states inspection and oversight authority 
over interstate pipelines; require 
interstate pipelines to consult with states about their integrity plans; 
create stiffer penalties for pipeline safety 
transgressors; and offer protection to whistle-blowers who report pipeline 
violations. McCain proposed the 
agressive safety bill following the product pipeline explosion in Bellingham, 
WA, that killed three in June 1999. 

"McCain has always been determined to pass this bill this year, but this 
obviously sadly strengthens that resolve," 
she said. He "will make a determined effort for this to happen," but whether 
it's brought up for a vote on the Senate 
floor will be up to Senate Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), the McCain spokeswoman 
said. 

"I have no doubts" that the Senate will push for pipeline safety when it 
returns, said Terry Boss, vice president of 
environment, safety and operations for the Interstate Natural Gas Association 
of America (INGAA). 

On the House side, a companion to McCain's bill has been introduced, as well 
as a number of other pipeline safety 
measures, but most are at the subcommittee level. But the issue could pick up 
steam in the wake of the El Paso 
blast. "We must examine why this accident occurred and ensure that it must 
never happen again," said Rep. Joe 
Skeen (R-NM). 

"Definitely it's a tragic situation," Boss said, referring to the explosion 
near Carlsbad, NM, which reportedly left a 
crater about 20 feet deep, 46 feet wide and 86 feet long. Five of the 10 
fatalities were children, who were spending 
a weekend camping and fishing with their family along the Pecos River. 

The political fallout from the disaster was being assessed in Washington D.C. 
yesterday. "Any kind of incident 
has political ramifications.....We're just not sure how this is going to 
'directly impact'" pending legislation and 
regulations, Boss noted.

Title: High Natural Gas Prices Affect US Oil Demand and Supply
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2234


North America natural gas prices have increased nearly threefold in a year. 
Gas
has lost market share to the heavy end of the barrel, residual fuel, but it
also to middle distillates.

* CERA estimates that the curtailment of gas supplies to interruptable
customers, combined with economically driven switching, accounts for as much
as  0.55 mbd  of the strong year-on-year increase in US oil demand in January.

* For the short term, high gas prices are having a less pronounced effect on
the oil supply side in the United States, about 0.2 mbd.

* This spring about 0.1 mbd of the gains in oil demand due to switching should
be yielded back to gas.

Drive to Succeed: Enron Prefers Toyota to GM

To prosper in the new energy economy, Enron COO Jeffrey K. Skilling says oil 
and gas companies need to trash their traditional business models and instead 
reshape themselves to resemble Toyota when it captured the imagination and 
pocketbook of U.S. consumers 30 years ago. 

In a somewhat back-to-the-future treatise on how Enron expects to continue 
its monumental success, Skilling told Arthur Andersen Energy Conference 
attendees to define themselves not by their industry, but rather by their 
skills base. Toyota changed the U.S. auto industry by outsourcing its 
production, offering customers exactly what they wanted cheaper and faster. 
The energy industry has to do the same thing into the future, he told the 
Houston audience. 

"In 1982, the energy industry was a very rigid industry," he said, pointing 
to a similar business model that had been used by General Motors and Ford 
Motor Co. Those companies did every bit of the manufacturing process, keeping 
all of its pieces within the corporate structure. Then Toyota turned things 
upside down. 

When a customer wanted a different radio, Toyota relied on outside producers. 
It didn't stop the production line to please the customer. And it was able to 
do it faster. Enron has used the same model to shape its achievements, 
packaging components for customers to save time and money. Other energy 
companies are now adopting that method. 

In many ways, Skilling said Enron views itself as the Toyota of the energy 
industry. "We don't feel we have to provide all components, but package them 
the way the customer wants them. This is a pervasive trend we are seeing all 
over the industry." 

Enron, which has had a shareholder return of 1,333% in 10 years (January 1990 
to November 2000), saw the changes required by new technology and 
deregulation and redefined its core competencies, which grew from its 
pipeline business. Skilling said to remain successful, the Houston-based 
corporation plans to continue to morph. 

"It all hinges on one good idea Enron had in the 1980s, that vertically 
integrated structures had dominated our industry and the structures were 
starting to break up. In the energy industry, the reason was deregulation. 
Fundamentally, this is a better business structure for two reasons: you can 
be supplied with cheaper cost components and it allows you to change much 
more quickly." 

Instead of bigger energy companies, Skilling said he expects to see many 
smaller companies, "maybe thousands tied together electronically and 
vertically." The transformation and interaction costs are "collapsing across 
the economy." As an example of interaction costs, Skilling used bank tellers. 
In 1985, it cost a bank $1.50 a transaction. To bank on the Internet today, 
it costs a bank less than a penny. 

This drop in interaction costs is a major reason Enron finds the bandwidth 
market so attractive. In 1995, the length of time to provision bandwidth was 
six to eight months. Today, it's two to three months. And next year, Skilling 
predicts it will take one second. 

"We will have bandwidth on demand by next year," he said, and added that 
Enron plans to be the leader in the field. 

Similarly, long-term gas contracts in 1982 took two to three years to 
execute. In 1989, they took nine months. Three years ago, they took two weeks 
to execute. Today, using EnronOnline and other similar Internet trading 
systems, it takes less than one second. 

"All of the sudden the world has changed. We have the same manufacture cost, 
but interactive costs collapse. I think that because of this, we'll see the 
collapse and demise of integrated energy companies around the world," 
Skilling said. 

To survive, Skilling advised companies to "virtually reintegrate" what they 
need. "If you have an old vertically integrated mind set, it's tough. Give it 
up. I know there are still power producers who are buying gas reserves. I 
don't get it. It makes no sense whatsoever. You can get it online at the 
lowest cost. If your business strategy is dependent on this, it will be a 
very hard row to hoe." 

Each stage of production will become increasingly competitive in the next 10 
years, predicted the Enron president. "You're not just competing against 
three people in West Texas, but thousands around the world." 

Opportunities exist, he said, for those companies that "go with the flow and 
find ways to compete. Create low cost, dependable market interfaces...provide 
packaged turnkey solutions for customers through complex structures, 
differentiation and customization." 

The only threat is from the old way of doing business, he said. "But there is 
tremendous opportunity to do things for customer you've never been able to 
do." He suggested a "new" energy model based on brainpower, networking, 
offering real options to customers, moving quickly and being entrepreneurial. 

"At Enron, this has been the whole premise: to be able to change by 
responding and reacting to the environment. By getting components together 
and packaging them for the customer."

Note:  Kinder says that NGPL expected to add 3000-4000 MW of new gas-fired generation to NGPL each year through 2004.
TXU, Kinder Morgan to Build Gas Pipes for FPL Power Plant 
TXU and Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI) subsidiaries have been selected by FPL Energy LLC to fuel its gas-fired power plant near Forney, TX that is scheduled for commercial operation in mid-2003. Both TXU and Kinder Morgan subsidiaries will construct lines that connect to existing facilities. A KMI subsidiary also obtained a long-term contract with FPL to transport gas to a new facility. 
Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline LLC, a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, will construct a 30-inch, 85-mile pipe from an interconnect in Lamar County, TX to FPL Energy's existing 1,000 MW plant in Paris, TX and its 1,789 MW plant in Forney now under construction. The new pipeline will cost about $70 million and will have a capacity of 325,000 MMBtu/d. 
The company plans to finalize the new pipeline's route to minimize environmental and public impact and "wherever possible" to follow existing linear facilities such as power lines, highways and railroads. Construction is set to begin next summer. 
Richard Kinder, CEO of KMI, said that when the pipe is completed in the spring of 2003, it will be immediately accretive to KMI's earnings and cash flow, and called it "another example of our strategy of investing in pipeline infrastructure to enter new markets" where natural gas use is growing. 
TXU Lone Star Pipeline, a subsidiary of TXU, will construct a two-mile-long, 24-inch pipeline from its existing gas transmission system in eastern Dallas County to the Forney plant. TXU will replace a smaller, existing pipe in an existing pipeline right-of-way. Construction will begin next spring. No financial details on the TXU pipe were disclosed. 
Along with gaining the pipe contract, KMI subsidiary Natural Gas Pipeline Co.(NGPL) signed a firm transportation contract to provide FPL with natural gas to power its 1,789 MW facility in Forney. Under the long-term agreement, FPL Energy has subscribed for 250,000 MMBtu/d of firm capacity on the NGPL system, effective with the startup of operations at the new plant. FPL also agreed to extend an existing contract for 50,000 MMBtu/d of firm transportation service for another 18 years. 
"We expect to add 3,000-4,000 new megawatts of gas-fired electric generation to NGPL each year through 2004," said CEO Kinder. 
FPL owns and operates power plants with more than 4,400 total net MW in 12 states around the country. New projects will add nearly 6,000 MW of capacity to its portfolio by the end of 2003.

Kevin Hyatt and I attended Sempra Energy Trading's weather derivatives 
briefing in Houston last night, chaired by their chief meterologist, Dan 
Guertin.  Dan's forecast for the winter of '00-01 seems to track pretty much 
lockstep with the CPC's.  Dan also believes that this will be an 
"oceanographic neutral" winter, with no El Nino or La Nina influences.  He 
sees slightly above average temperatures for the western marketplace and a 
relatively "normal" winter pattern (30 yr. avg.) for the mid-continent.

As far as monthly variations, he is predicting a cooler than usual November - 
December, and a slightly warmer than usual pattern for the remainder of the 
heating season.  He has promised to make his presentation information 
available to the briefing attendees.  If I can secure a copy of it, I'll pass 
it on.

Subject: CPC's Winter Weather Prediction for the U.S.

Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook
?
??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The 
agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the 
next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes 
in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain 
patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first 
year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this  
particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a 
whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have 
something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have 
tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that 
this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, 
but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and 
particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder 
weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South. 
East of the Mississippi  with the exception of Florida should be cooler this 
winter and most of  California and the northern half of the Rockies and the 
Dakotas. For the fall  and winter, expect the Southwest to be the mild and 
dry.

InterGen Takes 30% Stake in Coral Energy

With plans to grow its power generation portfolio in the United States, 
InterGen, the power generation 
joint venture of Royal Dutch/Shell Group and Bechtel Enterprise Holdings 
Inc., closed a deal yesterday 
giving the international developer a 30% equity interest in Houston-based 
Coral Energy, one of the 
largest natural gas and power marketers in the country. 

Coral Energy officials had predicted in July that Shell and construction 
giant Bechtel would fold InterGen, 
InterGen North America and certain assets of Coral Energy into one business 
(see Daily GPI, July 10). 
Under the agreement announced yesterday, InterGen will receive the majority 
of the natural gas pipeline, 
storage and power generation assets of Shell's Coral Energy affiliate in the 
United States. It remains a 
joint venture of Shell and Bechtel. 

The move gives Shell a 68% ownership in InterGen, with Bechtel owning the 
remaining 32%. InterGen 
had been formed as a 50/50 joint venture, and Bechtel made an undisclosed 
payment to Shell in the 
deal. About 230 Coral employees, mostly related to the Texas-based assets in 
Houston, will become 
InterGen employees under the agreement. 

InterGen is considered a world leader in power generation development, with 
projects around the world. 
Carlos Riva, InterGen's CEO, said that the transaction "represents a 
significant boost to our plans in the 
United States. These assets and strengthened alignment with a premier U.S. 
gas and electricity trading 
enterprise will provide InterGen a strong platform for growth in the U.S. 
market." 

Globally, the alignment is expected to help leverage Shell's strengths in 
both fuel supply and power 
marketing and trading. Bechtel will continue to be InterGen's preferred 
provider for worldwide power 
generation engineering, procurement and construction services. Coral is the 
region's third largest natural 
gas marketer and the twentieth largest power marketer in the country. 

Linda Cook, Shell Gas and Power's CEO, said the "whole idea" was to help 
InterGen grow in the United 
States, and that the best way was to add Shell assets to it. "Success in 
tomorrow's energy markets will 
be earned through globally aligned marketing, trading and asset companies," 
said Cook. "That's 
critically true in the U.S. and will be the case as competitive energy 
markets open worldwide. InterGen 
plans to build a sizable power generation portfolio in the U.S., working 
closely with Coral to pursue 
investment decisions that make the most commercial sense. We expect this 
relationship to make a 
significant contribution to both InterGen's and Coral's long-term success." 

Shell and Bechtel formed InterGen in March 1999 (see Daily GPI, March 18, 
1999) specifically to pursue 
power generation opportunities in North America. The Boston-based company was 
set up to develop, 

"Shell, Bechtel and InterGen have among them the complete skill set for 
success in the new global energy 
market," said Paul Unruh, COO of Bechtel. "InterGen is a world-class 
developer with a proven track record 
of successfully developing, financing and operating projects around the 
world. Shell is one of the most 
successful marketers and traders of energy in the U.S. and is expanding into 
deregulating natural gas 
and power markets globally; Bechtel is a global leader in the development, 
engineering and construction 
of power facilities. These strengths together create a large power generation 
platform now directly linked 
with global energy marketing and trading." 

InterGen's portfolio will give Coral Energy access for its trading business, 
and Coral will participate as part 
of Shell's global trading network, with InterGen a business partner in its 
expanding North American asset 
platform. As the exclusive marketer of Shell's gas production, Coral has a 
gas supply of 2.5 Bcf/d, and a 
trading platform dealing in extensive volumes of energy in all key supply 
basins. For Bechtel, the agreement 
will help it lock in construction contracts for its combined cycle gas 
turbine power stations. 

Specifically, the assets to be transferred to InterGen from Coral include the 
following: 

4,000 miles of major intrastate gas pipelines in Texas. The pipeline 
facilities extend from South Texas near the 
Mexican border along the Texas Gulf Coast to the Louisiana boarder, and north 
from near Houston to the East 
Texas producing areas. 
The West Clear Lake Storage facility, one of the largest natural gas storage 
reservoirs in Texas. Located near 
the Houston Ship Channel, it has a leasehold interest in the Stratton Ridge 
storage facility. 
Coral's interest of more than 500 MW in four power plants --- one in 
operation and three under construction. The 
transfer would follow equity and regulatory approvals. 
In total, Coral had 6,100 miles of gas pipeline that ran along the Gulf Coast 
in Texas and Louisiana. It also is 
building a 100-mile long pipeline in northern Mexico with that country's 
national oil company, PEMEX. 

Currently, InterGen is either operating or building 11 power stations with a 
total of 7,985 MW. It also has
7,040 MW in advanced development. Projects are being operated, under 
construction or are in advanced 
development in the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Colombia, Mexico, China, 
Egypt, Brazil, Australia, Turkey 
and the United States.

Quick Change in PG&E NW IT Allocation

Within hours of a FERC vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its 
interruptible transportation (IT) queue, PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest 
announced new procedures effective today. 

The Commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted 
PG&E NW's tariff sheets as of Oct. 25, saying the revisions were "generally 
in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation 
procedures." 

Under the revised tariff PG&E NW said "IT capacity will be allocated as 
follows: 

 First to shippers paying maximum rate; 

 If there are more confirmed IT nominations from shippers all paying the 
maximum rate, then IT capacity will be allocated pro-rata to the confirmed 
nominations.~ For example, if the capacity constraint were at Station 14, a 
shipper with a confirmed nomination paying maximum rate from Stanfield to 
Malin would be allocated capacity pro rata with a shipper with a confirmed 
nomination at the maximum rate for service from Kingsgate to Malin. 

 Second to shippers paying discounted rates or negotiated rates at less then 
the maximum rate. The discounted/negotiated IT space will be allocated on 
highest to lowest total revenue (rate x mileage).~ For example, a shipper 
with a confirmed nomination for service with a total revenue per Dth of $0.11 
would be awarded capacity ahead of a shipper with a confirmed nomination for 
service with a total revenue of $0.10, regardless of the path nominated. 

 Discounted IT shippers having the same total revenue will be allocated space 
on a pro ration of their confirmed nominations." 

Questions can be addressed to PG&E NW's transportation coordinator at 
503-833-4300.

FPL Acquires Entergy

    FPL Group will acquire Entergy for about $6.4 billion in stock in
a deal that will create the largest US power company. The news sent
FPLs shares lower because of disappointment that FPL was not the
takeover target. The combined company will have 6.3 million customers
and 48,000 MW of power generating capacity. FPL supplies electric
service to about 3.8 million customers throughout Florida. Entergy
delivers electricity to about 2.5 million customers in parts of
Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The deal, a $27 billion
merger, which included their combined market value of $16.4 billion,
$6.9 billion of Entergy debt and $3.8 billion of FPL debt. FPL
shareholders will own 57% of the new company and Entergys 43%. The
board of directors will be made up of 8 FPL members and 7 Entergy
members. To support the deal, FPL and Entergy plan to buy back a
total of $1 billion in stock, $570 million in FPL stock and $430
million in Entergy stock. FPL shareholders will receive one share in
the new company for each of FPLs 170.5 million diluted shares
outstanding. Entergy shareholders would receive 0.585 share in the
new company for each of their 228.1 million diluted shares
outstanding. Shares of FPL fell more than 8%, to 48-1/4 and Entergy
shares fell more than 10% to 27-1/4 yesterday afternoon. Based on
FPLs price on Monday morning, the deal values Entergy at about $28.33
per share. Many had speculated FPL was to be bought rather than be
involved in a merger. The merger agreement includes a $200 million
break-up fee in case either side terminates the deal. The merger of
FPL and Entergy must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal
regulators and was expected to close next year. The combined company
expects to pay a dividend that is consistent with FPLs current
dividend policy. Based on its current annual dividend of $2.16 per
share, Entergys shareholders would receive $1.26 per share compared
with its current dividend of $1.20 per share. FPLs Broadhead will
become the chairman and Entergy Chief Executive Leonard will become
chief executive of the new company. The expected annual cost savings
and increased revenues for both competitive and regulated businesses
may range from $150 million to $275 million, with about half the cost
savings to come from work force reductions, mainly through attrition,
growth and voluntary retirement.

Note:  The buyer of the El Paso interest in Oasis has not been announced.  A 
consent agreement has been filed with the 
FTC and State of Texas Tennesse Pipeline as part of the normal review process 
prior to final approval for the PG&E Texas
assets formally owned by Valero and TECO.   Tennessee had a note in their 3rd 
quarter 10-Q on El Paso possibly putting 
some of the PG&E Texas acquired properties in their MLP.  They also indicated 
they had put their Crystal Storage in the MLP.

El Paso to Sell Oasis Pipe Stake

El Paso Energy Corp. will sell its 35% stake in Oasis Pipe Line, a 1 Bcf/d 
line in Texas, according to a disclosure in a securities filing made last 
week. El Paso said that the sale, which was negotiated in October, would 
result in a $20 million loss. 

The 36-inch intrastate gas line runs 608 miles from the West Texas Waha 
market to the Katy hub outside of Houston. The pipeline provides a link 
between El Paso Natural Gas and Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and is the principal 
route for Permian Basin supplies to access the Houston Ship Channel. 

Oasis completed a substantial upgrade in 1998, installing 9,400 horsepower of 
compression, and new interconnects to increase deliveries to eastern markets. 

Dow Hydrocarbons and Aquila Energy, a unit of Utilicorp United, also own 
stakes in the line. Along with its 35% ownership, Aquila also has firm 
transport rights on 280,000 Mcf/d. 

Before El Paso's sale is complete, it still needs approvals from the Federal 
Trade Commission and the Texas Attorney General.

PG&E to Expand Pacific Northwest System

Responding to tight energy supplies in the Pacific Northwest and California, 
PG&E Corp.'s National Energy Group revealed plans Wednesday to begin an open 
season early next year, kicking off a five-year expansion effort. The first 
phase would add 200 MMcf/d of firm transportation capacity out of western 
Canada on its Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) pipeline system. The PG&E GTN 
group expects the phase one expansion to be in service by November 2002 at 
the latest. 

"As we have been anticipating, the western natural gas market is at a 
critical point in the need for additional pipeline capacity," said Thomas B. 
King, president of the PG&E National Energy Group (PG&E NEG) West Region. 
"Gas supplies into the Pacific Northwest and California are very tight. At 
the same time, the market is strong and growing, and the PG&E Gas 
Transmission Northwest pipeline system has been operating at or near maximum 
capacity levels for the greater part of the year. We believe GTN is now 
positioned for an aggressive expansion period that will result in additional 
supplies of natural gas --- at competitive transportation rates --- in this 
region for both direct-use customers and electric generation by 2002." 

King noted that the phase one expansion of the GTN system was brought on 
primarily because of the state of disarray in the California market. He cited 
the growing use of gas to fuel electric generating facilities as the main 
reason new capacity is needed. 

King added that the GTN pipeline system is the most direct and economic link 
for tapping the Canadian production basins, and bringing the load to 
California and the Pacific Northwest markets. He also emphasized that the 
expansions would help the market prepare for new supply from Alaska. 

"We are constantly talking to our customers about what is the right time for 
us to expand our pipeline system," said Sandra McDonough, spokeswoman for 
PG&E Corp. "With the power plant development both in California and in the 
Pacific Northwest, including plants in the Northwest that are being built 
right next to our pipeline, the time is clearly now to start expanding the 
system. We have gotten more bids for capacity than we have been able to move 
recently." McDonough told Daily GPI last week that the company was looking to 
expand its mainline in the near future (see Daily GPI, Dec. 13). 

To gauge demand, PG&E NEG plans to launch an open season for the 200 MMcf/d 
expansion of the mainline beginning on Jan. 2, 2001. Bids are due by Feb. 15, 
2001. Following the open season, the company will hold a capacity 
rationalization period, which will allow existing shippers to release 
capacity directly to customers who have expressed an interest. 

The 612-mile dual pipe GTN system begins at the Idaho-British Columbia 
border, travels through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central 
Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon-California border where it connects with 
the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. intrastate pipeline system. 

Currently, the GTN system is the largest U.S. transporter of Canadian natural 
gas with 2.7 Bcf/d of capacity. The expansion was deemed necessary because 
the average contract term on the line extends through 2013, and the pipeline 
has been operating at capacity, or near capacity for most of 2000. The method 
of expansion had not been decided on yet, but it is expected to include 
additional compression and some looping. 

McDonough said PG&E has been in contact with its upstream providers including 
TransCanada Pipelines Limited (TCPL) to ensure coordination of capacity. Doug 
Baldwin, CEO of TCPL, said TransCanada will work with PG&E NEG to examine 
and, if appropriate, satisfy the needs of market participants in both the 
western United States and Canada. 

If response to the open season is adequate, PG&E NEG hopes to move along with 
the project immediately. The November 2002 in service date includes an 
anticipated one-year process to obtain a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
(FERC) permit. 

"We also expect to have an incremental 265 MMcf/d of new direct-connect 
gas-fired electric generation load along the GTN system in the Pacific 
Northwest by mid-2002," King said. "We expect to follow the 2002 project 
immediately with additional pipeline expansions to meet the need for 
additional gas supplies in the Pacific Northwest, on both the east and west 
sides of the Cascade Mountains." 

For the next five-to-eight years, PG&E Corp. expects to be busy with pipeline 
expansions and new additions. The company has planned a second mainline 
expansion to be in service in 2004, with a new interconnect near Spokane, WA, 
which will serve the Puget Sound/Seattle area. The last expansion phase will 
be brought online sometime after 2005. With Alaskan gas fields expected to be 
ready for commercial service in the next five to 10 years, PG&E NEG will 
build an expansion that will facilitate transportation of gas from Alaska and 
Canada's Northwest Territories to markets in the lower 48 states. 

"Overall what we are looking at is the potential to expand the system by 1 
Bcf/d over the next decade," McDonough said.

interview with Alliance personnel

Construction Completed on Alliance Pipeline

The C$4.6 billion Alliance natural gas and liquids pipeline, designed to 
transport 1.325 Bcf/d from northeast 
British Columbia to Chicago, has completed its construction phase and now is 
commissioning the main line, 
laterals, compressors and supervisory equipment. 

The final weld was completed last week near Regina, SK, and Alliance now is 
injecting linepack. The 1,857 
mile mainline is stretched to the Chicago area from northeastern BC. October 
is still the target month to begin 
service of the pipeline, which will carry both natural gas and liquids. 

The pipeline system will transport natural gas through a 36-inch diameter 
high-pressure line. There will be 14 
mainline compressor stations: seven in Canada and seven in the U.S. When it 
began construction in 1999, 
Alliance already had commitments from 37 shippers for 15-year contracts worth 
a total of $8.2 billion.

The large volumes of gas Alliance will haul from western Canada into the U.S. 
Midwest is expected to have 
a major impact on existing pipelines, markets and prices. TransCanada 
PipeLines already has filed for new 
tolls to compensate for customers which have failed to renew firm contracts 
on its line and instead are routing 
their gas through Alliance. New gas that makes its way into the Chicago area 
could be sent on to southern 
Ontario through the Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline, scheduled to open in 
late October with intial capacity 
of 720 Bcf/d.  The Foothills/Northern Border route from western Canada into 
the Midwest also is expected to 
see some slack. 

Alliance spokesman Jay Godfrey said last month that "when October comes we 
won't be in the position that 
we'll have to start filling the pipe. It essentially already is going to be 
full." Connections to 37 gas plants are 
already complete. 

Investors in Alliance Pipeline Limited Partnerships include affiliates of 
Coastal (14.4%), Enbridge (21.4%), 
Fort Chicago Energy Partners LP (26%), Williams (14.6%) and Westcoast Energy 
(23.6%).

Title: Monthly Briefing: A Shoulder Month Without Shoulder Prices

**********************************************************************

As western markets continue to struggle through high August demand and prices 
for both power and natural gas, September looms as the start of the fall 
shoulder season. The shoulder season historically has brought the possibility 
of a break in weather and a demand drop in both power and gas prices from 
summer levels. CERA expects this shoulder season to differ from years past, 
however, with power and gas markets producing strong year-over-year prices 
and little relief from summer levels, even with normal September weather.

West-wide power loads will decline but will remain similar to those in June, 
a month with high power prices. In addition, compared with June levels 
hydroelectric capacity has dropped owing to reduced stream flows, leaving 
more expensive gas-fired generation to replace declining hydroelectric 
output. CERA expects occasional hot weather and higher gas prices to push 
on-peak prices in the West to 244 percent over September 1999 levels.

Continued strong use of gas-fired generation in the West, as well as low US 
storage inventories and tight supply demand balances, will keep the pressure 
on gas prices. Topock prices are expected to average $4.45 per million 
British thermal units (MMBtu) in September.

These high September gas and power prices are driven by

* Declining hydroelectric output. The months of September through November 
represent the low point for hydroelectric output in the West, with rainfall 
historically boosting output in December. Approximately 16,400 average 
megawatts (aMW) will be available from hydroelectric facilities during the 
three-month period. This represents a net reduction in capacity of 6,900 aMW 
when compared with the recent June-August summer months and a reduction of 
3,600 aMW when compared with September 1999 levels.

* Higher, more variable power demand. The Southwest and Southern California 
still experience hot weather in September, and regional utilities typically 
consider it possible that a year's peak load event will occur in September. 
Spiking loads, however, can quickly retreat with a return to cooler weather. 
Thus, power loads and power prices are expected to experience a high degree 
of variability during September.

* High levels of gas-fired generation. Load growth and a declining 
hydroelectric resource base will require gas-fired resources to serve 
approximately the same level of demand as in June 2000, a month with similar 
average demand and monthly average on-peak power prices in the $150-$178 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) range, depending on the region. This strong pull on 
gas-fired plants will push deep into the generation resource base, driving 
prices upward. An additional 1.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day will be 
required for gas-fired generators in the US West compared with September 1999 
levels.

* Strong North American gas prices. Natural gas prices are expected to retain 
most of this summer's peak levels, as North American supplies remain tight. A 
market anxious about winter demand and price levels will also limit a price 
retreat this fall. As a result, average September Henry Hub prices are 
expected to trade around $3.95 per MMBtu. An active storm season could keep 
Henry Hub prices near the $4.50 mark.

* Strong western basis differentials. The strong demand for gas to serve 
gas-fired generation and storage concurrently will maintain western basis 
differentials at high levels, especially in the California markets. CERA 
expects a Topock-to-Henry Hub differential of $0.40 per MMBtu during 
September. Extended operational problems associated with El Paso's pipeline 
rupture would raise that outlook.

Regional Power Market Drivers
Hotter-than-normal August weather, transmission and generator outages, high 
natural gas prices, and declining hydroelectric output all contributed to a 
rise in power price levels during August. Southern California average power 
prices in August have thus far exceeded July levels by an average of $90 per 
MWh during the on-peak period and by $14 per MWh during the off-peak period. 
Mid-Columbia power prices, bearing the brunt of fire-induced transmission 
outages, experienced a jump from July price levels of $114 per MWh for the 
on-peak period and $20 per MWh in the off-peak period.

Off-peak prices, which have averaged above $60 per MWh during the June-August 
period, are clearly defined by the production cost of gas-fired resources. 
On-peak prices during this same period, at over $100 per MWh in all regions 
in all months, have reflected a significant premium at times over the cost of 
the marginal system generator (see Table 1).

A return to normal weather should drive West-wide loads down by 8,300 aMW in 
September from August levels. However, load growth and a return to normal 
weather are expected to push loads up by 5,400 aMW when compared with 
September 1999 levels. These greater loads, coupled with a reduction in 
hydroelectric generation of 3,600 aMW from last September's levels, will 
create supply tightness during September (see Tables 2 and 3).

Hydroelectric, coal, and nuclear generation together will be insufficient to 
serve West-wide demand in September, even during much of the off-peak 
periods, requiring gas-fired resources to meet a significant portion of the 
load. Gas demand for power generation is expected to average 5.2 Bcf per day 
in September, down from over 5.9 Bcf per day in August but up by a dramatic 
1.7 Bcf per day compared with levels in September 1999.

September power prices will be defined by a floor set by the incremental cost 
of gas-fired generation, approximately $50 per MWh, with prices frequently 
higher as demand increases. As this summer has clearly demonstrated, prices 
rise in a nonlinear fashion as supplies grow very tight. Hot weather-induced 
loads should provide additional examples of this relationship. * Cooler- or 
hotter-than-normal weather in September, coupled with the inherent high 
variability of September loads, will produce a wide range of price outcomes. 
Under normal weather, on-peak power prices are expected to fall in the 
$113-$123 per MWh range, depending on location, representing a 244 percent 
premium to year-ago September prices (see Figure 1).

The latest revision of the California Independent System Operator's (ISO's) 
imbalance energy market cap down to $250 per MWh is expected to depress 
market prices during any weather events in September. CERA expects the ISO 
price cap to limit prices outside of California as well.

Pacific Northwest
Although demand levels in the Pacific Northwest are expected to retreat in 
September by at least 1,100 aMW compared with those in the hotter-than-normal 
month of August, the loss in available capacity from hydroelectric resources 
will amount to 1,900 aMW over the same period (see Table 4). Thus, the 
Pacific Northwest will be in an even more limited position to export power to 
other regions. With transmission interties operating at below rated capacity 
during this period, power prices in the Pacific Northwest will maintain their 
tight relationship with those in Northern California. These price levels will 
continue to support the operation of the region's limited quantity of 
gas-fired generation. Mid-Columbia on-peak price levels are expected to 
average $118 per MWh in September.

Off-peak power price levels in the Pacific Northwest will also receive a 
boost from the strong markets to the south. The expected September level of 
$54 per MWh represents the opportunity cost of power sales in surrounding 
markets.

California
The fall months initiate a seasonal shift in price differentials that 
separates the West into markets that lie north of transmission Path 15 and 
those to the south. As in years past, hydro-depleted Northern California 
should experience demand levels that must be served by generation resources 
within the region. Exports from the Pacific Northwest dwindle, and energy 
from the nuclear and coal-rich Southwest is constrained from entering 
Northern California by Path 15 import limitations. This condition, which is 
expected to persist from September through November, allows Northern 
California to price at a premium. The expected monthly average on-peak 
Northern California price of $123 per MWh incorporates this dynamic. Notably, 
the California ISO is completing a process to remap the zones in California, 
in part to capture locational price differences more effectively.

Southern California, like the Southwest, will typically experience hot 
weather episodes in September. During these high demand periods, prices will 
rise to peak levels as experienced this summer. In addition, California as a 
whole should see average loads in September that are 4,600 aMW higher than 
those of September 1999. Occasional cooler weather will sharply but 
temporarily reduce daily prices. Southern California benefits from the 
abundant export capacity of the Southwest during cooler weather in that 
region, allowing prices to fall well below those in Northern California. An 
$8 per MWh differential between the north and south portions of the state is 
expected, with Southern California on-peak prices averaging $115 per MWh.

Off-peak prices of $53 and $47 per MWh for Northern and Southern California, 
respectively, reflect the continued need for gas-fired resources to support 
September off-peak loads.

Rockies and Southwest
An extended period of hot weather in July and August has boosted demand in 
the Rockies, a region with growing saturation of residential air 
conditioning. Limited transmission capacity and a dearth of cheaper exports 
from surrounding regions have allowed the Rockies to price temporarily at a 
premium to all other regions in the West.

A return to normal weather in September should restore the previously tight 
relationship of Rockies prices to those in the North. Rockies prices are 
expected to fall with loads, with a September monthly on-peak price average 
of $113 per MWh and an off-peak price average of $43 per MWh.

CERA expects Southwest prices to be tightly connected to prices in Southern 
California on a monthly average basis. The two regions generally experience 
the same September weather patterns, and a strong 7,600 MW transmission link 
between the two market centers allows them to balance loads with each other. 
Strong gas prices and occasional market tightness-induced price run-ups will 
maintain on-peak prices at the $115 per MWh level in September. Off-peak 
prices will, like those in Southern California, be buoyed by the high cost of 
gas-fired generation. A price level of $47 per MWh is expected for off-peak 
prices.

Regional Gas Market Drivers
The summer competition for gas supply between power and storage continues in 
North America, with gas prices reflecting the intensity of that competition. 
Even as the summer power peak subsides in September across the United States, 
the need to continue strong storage injections and the threat of storms in 
the Gulf will keep prices high and volatile. The storage deficit now stands 
at approximately 350 Bcf, and US storage inventories look likely to head into 
winter at historically low levels. This critical storage situation will keep 
prices high despite overall declines in power loads in September. CERA 
expects a Henry Hub price of $3.95 per MMBtu during September.

In the West strong power loads and the potential for power peaks persist 
through September, especially in California. Overall, total demand for gas is 
expected to decline across the West from 10.1 Bcf per day during August to 
9.8 Bcf per day during September (see Table 5). This load will tend to keep 
intraregional differentials wide throughout the West during the month. The 
recent price disconnects between the supply-rich Rocky Mountains and San Juan 
Basin and demand-charged California will persist. October should bring some 
change in this dynamic as heating loads in the Rockies begin to increase.

In general, winter will bring a dramatic shift in regional pricing 
differentials throughout the West. The summer pressure on Rocky Mountain 
supplies caused by high utilization rates on most export pipelines will be 
relieved somewhat by regional heating loads. Declines in flows into the San 
Juan Basin from the Rockies will take some downward pressure off prices in 
the San Juan. On the other hand, healthy California storage inventories 
should limit price premiums at Topock through the heating season. The 
start-up of the new Alliance pipeline, which will draw gas to the Midwest, 
will support prices in the Pacific Northwest and California.

California
Topock continues to be the premium pricing point in North America, although 
differentials between Southern California and the Henry Hub subsided somewhat 
from peak levels near $1.00 per MMBtu before this weekend's pipeline 
explosion. Total imports into California reached record levels during July; 
total imports of 5.8 Bcf per day eclipsed the previous high by 300 million 
cubic feet (MMcf) per day (see Table 6). Pipeline capacity into the state 
during the month ran at 83 percent utilization. So far in August, pipeline 
capacity utilization is exceeding even that high rate, running at 85 percent. 
These high rates of capacity utilization are putting pressure on gas prices 
in Southern California, and the pressure should continue during September.

Total demand in California is expected to decline somewhat during September, 
but continued strong power loads and low seasonal hydroelectric generation 
will provide support. Total demand in the state should average 6.6 Bcf per 
day, down only slightly from August's total of 6.8 Bcf per day. Flows into 
the state between August and September are not likely to change 
significantly, but price pressure should decline somewhat with demand. The 
Topock differential to the Henry Hub should average approximately $0.50 per 
MMBtu for September (see Table 7).
Storage inventories in the West are still healthy relative to levels in the 
rest of the United States, but the storage surplus in the region has eroded. 
In California, inventories are running lower than last year, and the deficit 
in the state looks likely to widen during September. The end of injection 
season storage inventories will determine the vulnerability of Topock 
differentials to winter price spikes.

Pacific Northwest
Malin prices this summer have shown neither the strong premiums that Topock 
prices have shown nor the wide discounts that supplies in the Rocky Mountains 
and San Juan Basins have shown. So far this month, prices at Malin are 
averaging a $0.25 per MMBtu discount to the Henry Hub. Pipeline capacity into 
the region from the Rocky Mountains is running nearly full; flows on PGT out 
of Alberta have averaged nearly 2.2 Bcf per day this month. Export capacity 
out of the region on PGE GT NW is running close to capacity, and pipeline 
constraints to the south combined with strong California demand are driving 
the wide Malin-to-Topock differentials.

Continuing strong demand in the South will likely keep Topock prices strong, 
and the wide north-south differentials within the West will likely hold 
through September. In the Pacific Northwest demand is expected to climb 
through September to 1.5 Bcf per day from 1.4 Bcf per day in August. This 
demand level should keep Malin differentials from widening from current 
levels. For September CERA expects Malin prices to average $0.10 per MMBtu 
below the Henry Hub price.

Southwest
Prices in the San Juan Basin this summer have been left behind by rising 
California demand. Although the westward pull on supplies is strong, 
bottlenecks between California and the San Juan have led to disconnects 
between San Juan prices and Topock prices. Pipeline capacity utilization 
rates on Transwestern and the northern leg of El Paso reached 93 percent 
during July, with less than 200 MMcf per day of excess pipeline capacity. 
Increased flows from the Rockies on TransColorado and Northwest are 
contributing to downward pressure on San Juan Basin supply, and in general, 
the San Juan has followed Rocky Mountain prices rather than following prices 
at Topock or the Permian Basin.

Unlike in the past two summers, the bottleneck has not allowed power demand 
on the West Coast to support San Juan prices relative to Permian prices. The 
differential between San Juan and Permian has averaged $0.50 per MMBtu so far 
this month and $0.30 per MMBtu since June. Additional imports from the 
Rockies into the San Juan have increased supply by 200 MMcf per day relative 
to last summer, but these higher flows do not fully explain the disconnect. 
Without much change in Southwestern or Rocky Mountains local demand, the San 
Juan should continue to price at a wide discount during September. The San 
Juan-to-Henry Hub differential is expected to average $0.60 per MMBtu. As in 
the Rockies, differentials should narrow substantially in October.

Rocky Mountains
Downward pressures on Rocky Mountain prices intensified over the past month 
as utilization rates on pipelines out of the region continued to climb. 
Record heat and power generation levels have done little to boost gas demand 
within the region; generation is still largely coal-based, and the demand 
impact on gas of the additional load is minimal. CERA expects the heavy 
discount-current Rocky Mountain-to-Henry Hub differentials are around $0.90 
per MMBtu-to persist through September. Local area demand is not expected to 
change during September. Substantial gain in local demand comes in October 
with heating loads; October demand should average 1.4 Bcf per day, up from 
August and September averages of around 1.2 Bcf per day.

Although the winter heating season will relieve pipeline pressures in the 
Rockies, winter differentials are expected to stay in the $0.25 to $0.40 per 
MMBtu range. Strong storage inventories will limit the connection with 
broader North American markets this summer. Next summer, pressures on Rockies 
supplies will likely intensify relative to this summer. Although pipeline 
expansion projects have been announced-Trailblazer and Williams announced 
expansion plans this summer-the new capacity will not be online to relieve 
constraints next summer. CERA expects supplies within the Rocky Mountains to 
increase by 300 MMcf per day next year.

Western Canada
After widening to over US$1.50 per MMBtu, the AECO-Henry differential has 
begun to narrow somewhat; maintenance that has restricted flows has largely 
been responsible for the jump from $0.84 per MMBtu in July. With current 
supply able to fill the contracted pipe capacity and incremental volumes 
having to pay full cost to flow, differentials are likely to persist in the 
mid-US$0.70s per MMBtu for September. AECO is expected to be US$3.25 per 
MMBtu (C$4.53 per gigajoule) for September. Even with the start-up of the 
Alliance project, the contract nonrenewal on TransCanada is likely to 
continue the two-tiered pricing dynamics of contracted versus uncontracted 
pipeline costs. This will result in differentials that will range between 
US$0.60 and US$0.75 per MMBtu throughout the winter.

Supply build in western Canada continues to languish behind last year's 
levels. The pace of drilling (over 9,000 gas wells are expected this year) 
should provide growth in the fourth quarter and into 2001. Supply is expected 
to be flat with 1999 on an annual basis for this year and up at least 350 
MMcf per day in 2001.

Sumas prices have been quite volatile, driven by both weather in the Pacific 
Northwest and maintenance on the Westcoast system. For September, Sumas is 
expected to be slightly more stable and to price at a modest premium to AECO 
of US$0.05 per MMBtu.

Breaking News : California Stakeholders Agree to Key Objectives 
posted 10:18 AM (CST) Jan 10, 2001
 
Signs of compromise and cooperation emerged from a marathon seven-hour 
meeting last night between California government officials, power industry 
executives and the Clinton administration on California's continuing energy 
crisis. A set of key principles were hammered out by the two dozen 
participants, according to a statement issued following the meeting.

The stakeholders agreed on the need for cooperation to "maintain stability 
and avoid bankruptcy of California utilities and assure the long-term 
regularity of market conditions." The utilities have amassed $12 billion in 
unrecovered wholesale power costs, and despite the recent approval of new 
rate surcharges the utilities remain on the brink of financial insolvency.

The meeting participants agreed on a few crucial elements of a solution to 
California's power woes, including the following: development of approaches 
to promote long-term purchases of power, possibly by the state, from 
generators at an "attractive fixed rate;" the willingness of generators and 
qualifying facilities and marketers to provide on a short-term basis 
"forebearance of amounts owed by Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison" in the 
context of a comprehensive solution; the need to find "satisfactory 
approaches" to the utilities' obligations to purchase power; cooperation to 
"better match supply and demand;" and review of the existing qualifying 
facilities payment structures.

Working groups are meeting today in Washington, D.C. to address additional 
technical details and the senior policy makers will reconvene this weekend to 
complete an agreement.

FERC Chairman James Hoecker, said it was "to early to declare victory," but 
it was "an important first step to try to find ways to maintain stability and 
avoid bankruptcy." Hoecker, who also announced today that he will be leaving 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Jan. 18, said the atmosphere at 
the meeting was highly cooperative. "They appear to be headed in the 
direction that would seem to be consistent with FERC's Dec. 15 order," he 
said.

NGPL Recontracts with NIPSCO

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) continues to move through the 
recontracting 
process like a hot knife through butter. Since Kinder Morgan took over NGPL 
parent KN Energy 
last year, the interstate pipeline subsidiary has signed multiple agreements 
and contract 
extensions for gas transportation and storage with its major shippers in the 
Midwest, including 
another deal announced yesterday with Northern Indiana Public Service 
(NIPSCO). 

NGPL and NIPSCO signed a contract extending the terms of several firm 
transportation 
agreements totaling 295,100 MMBtu/d of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and 
Dec. 1, 2001 
and continuing through Nov. 30, 2002. They also extended the terms of two 
storage agreements 
totaling 10.5 Bcf of capacity beginning Dec. 1, 2000 and April 1, 2001 and 
continuing through 
March 31, 2003. NIPSCO, a NiSource subsidiary, is a regulated utility that 
provides natural gas 
o nearly 700,000 customers and electricity to 416,000 customers across the 
northern third of Indiana. 

"Virtually all of our operationally available capacity is sold out now until 
the fourth quarter of this 
year," said NGPL President Deborah Mcdonald in an interview. 

"Basically about a third of the transportation contracts and a third of the 
storage contracts are 
up for renewal every year. We've been very successful in our efforts 
resigning our three major 
customers [NiGas, NIPSCO and Peoples]." Despite increasing competitive 
pressure from 
Northern Border and Alliance Pipeline, the pipeline also has had surprising 
luck signing 
agreements with marketers and power generators. 

"In contrast to the traditional market of long-haul transportation from the 
Midcontinent and 
Louisiana to Chicago, we have been extending our horizons trying to find a 
new market in 
the marketers rather than the core LDCs. Obviously the contract that we 
signed earlier this
year with Aquila Energy for 500,000 MMBtu of transportation capacity has also 
really helped 
us be successful in our recontracting efforts," Mcdonald said. 

"We also have developed a number of new rate services for gas-fired power 
generators. 
Growth in NGPL will come from natural gas-fired generation. You probably saw 
our press 
release about the Ameren contracts for [construction of 1,700 MW of 
generation along the
NGPL system]. In the aggregate we think we are on target to connect over 
3,000 MW of 
gas-fired generation this year and over 3,000 MW next year as well [which 
would represent 
up to 900 MMcf/d in gas transportation capacity]. 

"Obviously another challenge is going to be [the 1.325 Bcf/d] Alliance 
Pipeline coming into 
the market this fall. It's anyone's guess whether that will really fill up in 
a short period of time. 
I think a lot of that will be coming into Chicago and moving back out on 
Vector. But we're 
ready at Hub America to kind of serve as a giant header system [with Texas 
Eastern as 
an eastbound partner]." 

Mcdonald was not prepared, however, to announce the results of a recent open 
season 
for about 100 MMcf/d of capacity that will be available through a new 
interconnection between 
NGPL and Tetco for eastbound transportation.

La Nina Dissipates But Effects Linger  

El Nino and La Nina, the terrible twins blamed for destructive weather  
patterns worldwide for the last three or four years, have finally 
dissipated.  However, their impact on the weather will likely continue for 
some time to  come, according to NASA scientists, based on the latest 
satellite data  gathered this month over the Pacific. While Pacific water 
temperatures have  gradually warmed over the past three to four months to 
near normal in the  tropics, the after effects of La Nina are seen in 
persistent below-normal  temperatures in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.

Note:  WEFA has made some interesting points in their conclusions of this 
study.  

Gas Turbines Headed for a 50% Meltdown

High natural gas prices, performance issues and higher than expected 
maintenance costs, a general economic slowdown and several other key factors 
will combine to create a "near-term meltdown in the gas turbine market," 
according to a report by WEFA, Inc. 

Reporting on a study about to be published by the analysis and consulting 
firm based in Eddystone, PA, one of its authors predicted "a substantial 
short-term correction in the gas turbine market..which could render 50% of 
current North American projects uneconomic." Jason Makansi, principal of 
Makansi & Co., pointed to other factors, such as the inexperience of many 
generating companies with the hedging and trading skills necessary to 
optimize profits in the peaking market, the rise of "stealth capacity" from 
refitted or otherwise optimized coal and nuclear plants, "gas transportation 
bottlenecks and persistent issues with safety and explosions," and "a 
protracted quasi-regulatory quagmire." 

Under the heading of stealth capacity, "old assets are being purchased or 
merged into new electric economy organizations that will improve capacity 
factors at coal-fired plants from the typical 60-65% to perhaps 80-85% within 
five years." A major part of the gain will come simply from operating the 
assets to serve the market and not just a single service territory, Makansi 
said. He reported on the soon-to-be released study at WEFA's World Economic 
Conference last week in New York. 

The nuclear industry is experiencing a similar transformation. Several years 
ago predictions were that as much as one-third of nuclear plants would soon 
be retired. Today, with many units sold to new owners and re-licensed, it 
appears the retirement rate will be more like 5-10% and productivity for the 
remaining units will be increased. 

The WEFA report points to a "technological correction" for the advanced 
technology "F-Class" turbines going into most new plants today, as unexpected 
problems crop up with extended use. There are a host of problems in the 
technology area, which can be met, but at a cost: the new units may not meet 
emissions targets without impacting efficiency, heat rate and durability; 
fuel-switching is not living up to its advance billing; units may not perform 
as well at high ambient temperatures; overhauls are required more frequently 
than had been expected; maintenance costs also are exceeding expectations; 
and fuel quality is becoming an issue. 

"Variable O&M costs at some projects with F-class machines are running as 
high as $25,000 to $30,000 per start. Considering that some of these machines 
may exhibit several hundred starts in a year, you have a variation of that 
worn phrase, "a start here, a start there, pretty soon you're talking about 
real money!" 

"The bottom line of all this is that many of the claimed performance 
advantages of the gas turbine have been lost or severely eroded." Makansi 
also pointed to similar experiences with gas turbines in the U.K., Asia, 
Australia, and Chile. He predicted a turbine market correction "and an 
unavoidable plateau to work out technological kinks, modify designs and 
inject reality into business models. We believe all this will push 
consolidation in the generation sector of the electricity industry even 
faster." Makansi predicted about half a dozen major players will control 50% 
of the generation capacity in the U.S. within five to 10 years. 

Co-authors of the report include Robert Swanekamp, a principal of Competitive 
Power Resources; engineering consultant Jeffrey J. Fassett; and Kemm Farney, 
vice president, WEFA Electric Power Service. For more information go to

Western Undeterred By Grueling Regulatory Process

Expressing frustration but continuing its resolve, Texas-based Western Hub 
Properties is ironing out some "technical issues" of financing with 
California regulators and now expects to start construction in February on 
its delayed Lodi gas storage field in northern California. 

The merchant storage project will be operating by this time next year, said 
Western Hub's California-based manager, Jim Fossum, who added that with 
faster approvals, the project could have been in service during this summer's 
electricity generating crunch and the current gas and power shortages. 

Despite the regulatory struggle, he said the company still plans to go 
through with its other California storage project near Bakersfield and the 
natural gas hub called Wheeler Ridge. Western has acquired leases on the 
property it needs and will start more detailed engineering of the proposed 
site over the first three to six months of next year. The company intends to 
make a filing with state regulators in summer of 2001. 

In both the approved Lodi project (see Daily GPI, May 19) and the proposed 
Wheeler Ridge storage field, Western is not concerned about lining up 
customers, said Fossum. The projects are not contingent on contracts, he 
said. "Now that we are a bona fide (certified plant) utility under the 
California Public Utilities Commission, we are getting some technical things 
worked out with the commission staff and nailing down the last small pieces 
of property, Fossum said. "Everything is basically ready to go at Lodi" 

"We have to file with them documents that verify certain aspects of the 
project's financing. We can't move ahead with the financing until the CPUC 
approves it. 

"If we had not encountered all of the roadblocks that we have had, we could 
have helped with the problems this last summer, and we could be helping with 
problems right now." He added that the project would not be operational in 
time to have any impact on the upcoming summer electricity demand and 
corresponding heavy natural gas demand to fuel power plants. 

Lodi and the Wheeler Ridge storage project are being designed as 
high-deliverability storage facilities. Lodi will have about 9 Bcf of working 
capacity, building to 12 Bcf. Initially, Fossum said, Lodi should have about 
400 MMcf/d injection capability and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal. 

In the southern half of the state, Western for some time has been doing 
reservoir studies near Wheeler Ridge and now has a "couple of reservoirs that 
we think might work," Fossum said. "We're in the preliminary planning phase." 

The Wheeler Ridge project would have an ultimate working capacity of 12 to 16 
Bcf and similar 500 MMcf/d deliverability at its peak. He said Western hopes 
to have something operational in the Wheeler Ridge area by the end of 2002.

News Briefs:
+Calpine to Acquire SkyGen Energy

Calpine Corp. said it plans to acquire SkyGen Energy LLC (SkyGen Energy)
from Michael Polsky and from Wisvest Corp., a Wisconsin Energy Corp.
affiliate, for $450 million, plus the assumption of certain obligations of
SkyGen Energy. The SkyGen Energy acquisition -- along with other recently
announced acquisitions -- would increase Calpine's 2004 operating portfolio
to over 40,000 MW of generation.

Upon closing of the transaction, expected during the third quarter of 2000,
Calpine will increase its power portfolio by up to 13,500 MW of natural
gas-fired generation in the U.S., and will acquire 34 General Electric 7 FA
gas turbines. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will add three operating
facilities (780 MW), three projects under construction (812 MW), 13
late-stage development facilities (5,258 MW) and 16 project development
opportunities (6,615 MW).

SkyGen was founded by Michael Polsky in 1991. SkyGen will continue to
develop its portfolio of development projects as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Calpine. Michael Polsky will serve as President of SkyGen and as a member
of Calpine's Board of Directors. To fund the SkyGen Energy and other
recently announced acquisitions, Calpine has obtained a $1 billion
short-term credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia, Credit Suisse First
Boston and CIBC World Markets. The company expects to refinance this
facility in the capital markets.

**********
+Panda, Calpine Form Business Alliance

Panda Energy International and Calpine Corp. formed a  business alliance
involving eight power plant projects Panda has under development,
representing nearly 10,000 MW of generating capacity. Under terms of the
agreement, Panda will provide development capabilities and carry each of the
projects to the construction phase. Calpine will have exclusive rights to
construct, own and operate the plants. Panda will participate in 50% of the
cash flow, above Calpine's priority return, in all the projects within the
alliance.

Included in the pact is the acquisition by Calpine of 24 General Electric
7FA combustion gas turbines and 12 steam turbines scheduled for delivery in
2001 to 2002. The first project to be developed under the alliance will be
the Oneta Power Partners, L.P., a 1,000 MW  natural gas-fueled power plant
now being built in Coweta, OK. Under terms of the agreement, Calpine will
pay Panda approximately $126 million, which includes reimbursement of
development costs, payments for the gas and steam turbines and the Oneta
facility. The Oneta transaction is expected to close in July. It is
scheduled to go into service in 2002.

CALIFORNIA REGULATORS SUSPEND DIRECT ACCESS TO COMPETIIVE ENERGY SUPPLIERS

California, once considered a harbinger of retail electricity deregulation, is 
reversing its previous efforts to create a competitive market for electricity. 
Suspending direct access is the latest--though probably not the final--event in 
an ongoing series of developments and unique conditions that has made 
deregulation a rocky road for players in the California market. 

*  This decision should not be interpreted as a rejection of the merits of 
retail competition, but rather understood as a decision peculiar to the events 
in California that have unfolded over the past 18 months. 

*  The ruling was motivated by the state's need to provide a stable investment 
environment to support its impending $13.4 billion bond offering to cover 
energy related costs. 

*  The demise of retail competition in California may delay other states' 
efforts to open their markets. However, most states face a very different power 
generation situation, practically ensuring that events in California will not 
be repeated in their markets. 

*  From a market perspective this may actually be an ideal time to push forward 
with retail choice programs, as many markets move into surplus capacity 
situations.

El Paso said the Waha Station's Solar turbines will be unavailable Dec. 18, 
which will limit deliveries at six Waha interconnects to 600 MMcf/d. Receipts 
from 12 interconnects will be limited to a total of 380 MMcf/d if their 
pressure is below 900 psig. Any of the affected points that can deliver to 
EPNG at pressures up to 1,000 psig will be able to flow normally scheduled 
volumes. The work is being scheduled now because current market demands have 
not required operation of the Solar turbines, El Paso said.

the West, suppliers will be unable to depend heavily on hydroelectric outpu=
t=20
in
February and later in the year. Gas suppliers are growing increasingly wary
about shouldering the increased risk.

Natural gas and power prices have declined from December=01,s record levels=
,
driven in part by January-to-date weather that has been warmer than normal.
Although Topock gas prices remain above the $10 per million British thermal
units (MMBtu) level, basis differentials to the Henry Hub have declined
dramatically from a premium over Henry Hub prices of $15 per MMBtu in Decem=
ber
to an average of $5.00 per MMBtu in January. Demand levels will likely hold
near January levels during February, as the already intense pull of gas for
power generation continues. Because storage levels in California remain low=
,
the California citygates will be exposed to temporary price spikes during
spells of cold weather. Differentials for February are expected to average
$0.65 to $0.75 per MMBtu, in the Rocky Mountains and San Juan producing bas=
ins
during February, $0.65 per MMBtu at AECO, and $3.00 per MMBtu at Topock.

Power prices in January have followed both the decline in gas prices and th=
e
shift to warmer weather. However, there is growing unease in the power mark=
ets
with the dry precipitation season to date. A significantly lower-than-avera=

Regional Power Market Drivers: Low Precipitation Threatens Already Difficul=
t
2001

Disappointing levels of precipitation have raised the specter that the 2001
power markets will be plagued by a below-average hydroelectric year.=20
Season-to-
date precipitation is currently 55 percent of normal in the upper Columbia
River Basin in British Columbia, 50 to 75 percent of normal in the US Colum=
bia
River Basin, and 50 percent of normal for California. January hydroelectric
output westwide has been higher than normal, as operators have run faciliti=
es
hard to supply energy during December and January energy shortages. In comi=
ng
months, however, output will be down roughly 2,275 average megawatts (aMW)
compared with the first quarter of 2000, owing in part to this early drawdo=
wn.
CERA has incorporated an outlook for hydroelectric production in 2001 that =
is
approximately 88 percent of CERA=01,s estimate for an average western hydro=

(see Table 1).

Concerns over low precipitation levels and the high drawdown rate of Pacifi=

Northwest hydroelectric facilities leave the Pacific Northwest particularly
vulnerable to higher prices in February, as winter weather=01)driven demand=

challenge regional supplies and California demand prevents a significant le=

Even under normal hydroelectric conditions, demand growth in early 2001 was
expected to push the utilization rates of US Western Systems Coordinating
Council (WSCC) gas-fired generation facilities to 50 percent, well above th=

nearly 60 percent in the first quarter  2001. This will cause markets to cl=

at or above the production cost of gas-fired generation even more often tha=
n=20
in
2000.

Pacific Northwest

Hydroelectric generators in the Pacific Northwest have drawn down the regio=
n=01,s
hydroelectric reservoirs to well below average historical levels. Grand=20
Coulee,
the largest hydroelectric facility in the West, with over 6,000 megawatts (=
MW)
of capacity, was near 75 percent of the historical average as of early Janu=
ary
and reflects the general condition of the major reservoirs in the region. I=

the event that precipitation remains low, the drawdown of these facilities =
in
early winter to meet load spikes in the Pacific Northwest and California ha=
s
hurt the region=01,s ability to supply power throughout 2001 and will maint=
ain
upward pressure on power prices.

Above-average temperatures in early January have helped to mask some of the
underlying strong fundamentals in the Pacific Northwest. Strong demand grow=
th
for the first quarter near 5 percent is expected, however, owing to economi=
c
growth and a return to normal weather from last year=01,s mild winter (see =
Table
3). Low hydroelectric availability and persistent gas prices in the $6 to $=
8
per MMBtu range at Sumas have the potential during the remainder of the win=
ter
to cause price spikes well above the $226 per MWh on-peak levels so far in
January, although average prices should be much lower. December=01,s averag=
e of
$570 per MWh demonstrated this potential clearly (see Table 4). Along with
demand growth near 5.5 percent year-over-year in February, cold snaps will
again bring price run-ups, particularly in the event that persistent low
precipitation in the region reduces the ability of hydroelectric operators =
to
draw down facilities past already-low levels.

CERA expects Mid-Columbia prices to stay near January levels in February fo=
r a
monthly average of $141 per MWh on peak and $135 per MWh off peak. Continue=
d
drops in hydroelectric reservoirs and weather-related events would push pri=
ces
periodically to December=01,s high levels.

California

Although California has had a December and early January that were nearly 1=
0
percent warmer than usual, January prices have reflected 5 percent demand
growth over 2000 owing to economic and other growth factors that have pushe=
d
gas-fired generators onto the margin more often, with higher gas prices at
Topock by $7 MMBtu, low hydroelectric availability westwide, and the degrad=
ed
condition of the California power market. Northern California snowpacks hav=
e
been higher than in other parts of the state but hover near 55 percent of
normal in spite of recent storms. Reservoir levels for the state are betwee=
n=20
50
and 100 percent of average, depending on location, but are in the 70 to 80
percent-of-average range for reservoirs affecting the state=01,s largest
hydroelectric facilities.

As California=01,s largest investor-owned utilities (IOUs) continue to stru=
ggle=20
to
obtain gas and power supplies in the face of financial insolvency, Californ=
ia
power prices have reflected a premium associated with the higher risk of
supplying the state. January differentials with western prices have grown a=
s
high as $40 per MWh, owing in part to temporary supply shortages as nuclear=
=20
and
other thermal plant outages at times have totaled over 15,000 MW. Northern
California=01,s import constraints make it particularly susceptible to thes=
e
temporary shortages, suggesting that continued low hydroelectric supplies w=
ill
increase the risk of repeated localized blackouts in the event of extensive
future outages.

The agreements reached through negotiations between suppliers, the IOUs, an=
d
state and federal officials in recent weeks will calm some of the price-
inflating uncertainty in the market, but California will be the premium mar=
ket
through the first quarter of 2001 and most of the coming year owing to
persistent supply tightness. For February in California CERA expects sustai=
ned
price strength of $152 per MWh on peak and $126 per MWh off peak.

Rockies and the Southwest

The Southwest and Rockies regions had warm weather in December and the firs=
t
half of January but have not been completely insulated from the price run-u=
ps
in other parts of the West. Demand growth in the region is expected to be n=
ear
3 percent for the first quarter, with February experiencing moderate 2 perc=
ent
growth, suggesting that most of the price strength will be attributed to
interconnections with the hydro-deprived California and Pacific Northwest
markets. Capacity margins in the Southwest are at their highest levels duri=
ng
the winter and=01*as an isolated subregion=01*would exceed 15 percent at th=
is time.

Compared with California prices, prices in the Southwest and Rockies region=
s
will reflect the relatively low cost of gas supply and the prevalence of co=
al-
fired generation (16,000 MW, or 48 percent of the installed base in the
region). CERA=01,s outlook for on-peak average price for February is $150 p=
er=20
MWh.
Off-peak prices in the Rockies will drop nearly $25 per MWh below the
Southwest, reflecting the ability of California markets to exert more=20
influence
on the Southwest than on the Rockies.

Western Gas Markets

Although gas prices at Topock have come down from lofty December levels,=20
winter
is far from over in the West; indeed, the pressure is intensifying. The cre=
dit
crisis precipitated by the power market crisis is spilling over into gas
markets; storage levels within California are again at critically low level=
s.
The mild weather during December and early January allowed some improvement=
 in
the positions, but when PG&E=01,s suppliers began refusing to serve because=
 of=20
the
utility=01,s credit problems, the utility responded by drawing heavily on s=
torage
inventories, and a spell of wintry weather compounded increased demand in t=
he
face of limited supplies. As a result, overall inventory levels are again
falling quickly.

CERA estimates that inventory levels in California are approximately 50=20
billion
cubic feet (Bcf). A continued heavy draw on gas for power generation will k=
eep
demand levels high (see Table 5), and the inability to manage demand spikes=
 by
drawing on storage inventories leaves the market exposed to price spikes.
Normal weather during February would probably allow prices at both Topock a=
nd
Malin to settle back into the $0.50 to $3.00 premium to the Henry Hub, but
extreme weather could push basis differentials as high as $6.00 per MMBtu.

In the Rockies and San Juan Basins, differentials will depend critically on=
=20
the
weather. Because supply levels and storage inventories in the Rockies are
healthy, the impact of swings in regional demand can cause wide swings in
differentials. CERA expects the swings to continue through February, with
differentials generally maintaining wider discounts to the Henry Hub by the=
=20
end
of the month.

As high absolute gas prices continue, more and more effects of these prices
will emerge. CERA estimates that 200 MMcf per day of base industrial demand=
 in
the West=01*particularly in California=01*has switched off of gas. Some end=
 users
have turned to diesel fuel for industrial boilers; some plants have simply
curtailed operations in response to the higher prices.

On the power side, plants within California are extremely limited in their
ability to burn alternative fuels because of emissions credits. However,=20
plants
outside of California do have some backup capability. Arizona Public Servic=
e
has purchased 400,000 barrels of 1% sulfur residual fuel oil to burn as an
alternative to gas. Given the intense pressure on gas, oil will absorb some=
 of
growth in power loads.

California

In November an early strong draw on storage in California raised questions
about winter deliverability within the state. A combination of low storage
inventories, high gas demand for power generation, and continued high
utilization rates on import pipelines into the state will keep pressure on
California prices through February (see Table 6). Despite efforts by end us=
ers
to limit gas burns in the state in the face of extremely high gas prices, C=
ERA
expects demand during January in the state is up by 650 MMcf per day on a=
=20
year-
over-year basis. In February, loads should start to decline as residential =
and
commercial demand declines through the month. However, power loads will rem=
ain
strong and actually climb from January into February as hydroelectric
generation falls.

This demand support, continued strong capacity utilization rates in import
pipelines into California, and critically low storage inventories will keep
intense pressure on gas prices within the state through February. During
periods of high demand, prices will likely reach back up into the $15.00 to
$20.00 per MMBtu range. Eventually, as heating loads settle and storage dra=
ws
slow toward the end of February, differentials should ease back into the $1=
.00
to $3.00 per MMBtu range. On balance, CERA expects a Topock differential fo=
r
February of $3.00 per MMBtu (see Table 7).

Pacific Northwest

Three factors have combined to strengthen Malin prices over the past week, =
and
these forces should extend price strength at Malin into February. First, th=
e
return of colder winter weather after moderate temperatures during late
December and early January is increasing heating loads and power loads.=20
Second,
lower-than-normal hydroelectric generation is increasing the draw on gas fo=
r
power generation during a season when the pull is normally low. Third, the
California power shortage is drawing on all regional supplies and supportin=
g
the demand for gas for power generation.

Pacific Northwest demand is expected to hold flat relative to January level=
s
during February with slight increases in gas demand for power generation
offsetting declines in residential and commercial demand. The sustained hig=
h
demand levels=01*despite relatively healthy Northwest storage inventory lev=
els=01*
will keep Malin prices well above Henry Hub prices. CERA expects a Malin to
Henry Hub differential of $1.00 per MMBtu during February.

A drop-off in demand of 200 MMcf per day is expected in March, as steep
declines in heating loads offset continued increases in gas demand for powe=
r
generation. However, prices at Malin will likely remain unusually strong th=
is
spring. Part of the shortfall in hydroelectric generation continues to be=
=20
made=20
up by draining reservoirs. That early drawdown will limit the availability =
of
hydroelectric generation through the spring and early summer months. Both l=
ow
hydroelectric generation and a challenging storage refill season in Norther=
n
California should sustain the Malin premium to the Henry Hub even into the
spring.

Rocky Mountains

The volatility in Rocky Mountain differentials continues. Differentials
continue to depend primarily on local heating loads; cooler weather support=
s
loads and prices within the region, but periods of warm weather drive steep
declines in Rocky Mountain prices relative to prices at the Henry Hub. Duri=
ng
February, demand should drop off in the region. Although declines in heatin=
g
loads in neighboring western regions will be offset by increases in gas dem=
and
for power generation, the Rockies remain primarily coal based. As a result,=
=20
the
lower expected hydroelectric output will do little to support loads within =
the
region. Increases in supply=01*CERA expects supply increases of 300 MMcf pe=
r day
during 2001 relative to 2000=01*will overwhelm available pipeline capacity =
out of
the region.

Demand during February in the Rockies is expected to remain flat at 2.9 Bcf=
=20
per
day; however, within the month demand loads will drop substantially. This w=
ill
put pressure on differentials toward the end of the month, and CERA expects
average basis differentials to the Henry Hub during February of $0.75 per
MMBtu. That widening trend should continue during March, with differentials=
 to
the Henry Hub eventually reaching $2.00 per MMBtu this summer.

Southwest

Prices in the San Juan Basin have been following Rocky Mountain prices up a=
nd
down with regional demand loads. That dynamic will likely continue through
February. CERA expects relatively flat demand during February within the
Southwest. As in the West as a whole, a significant drop-off is expected=20
during
March as residential and commercial heating demand wanes. For February,
continued strong demand loads within the Rockies and Southwest will support
prices in the San Juan, barring unusually warm weather. CERA expects a
differential to the Henry Hub of $0.65 per MMBtu.

As residential and commercial loads decline sharply during late February an=
d
March, prices in the San Juan will reflect ample supply. CERA expects decli=
nes
in San Juan production during 2001, but declines will be limited by the
strongest drilling activity for conventional supplies in the basin in a=20
decade.
However, pressure on Rocky Mountain supplies will mean increased exports fr=
om
the north into the San Juan, and those increased exports will more than off=
set
the declines in local production. Pipeline capacity constraints out of the =
San
Juan will again mean wide San Juan-to-Henry Hub differentials, with pressur=
e=20
on
prices developing during the spring and intensifying through the summer=20
months.

Western Canada: Increasing Supply

AECO differentials to the Henry Hub have ranged between $0.60 per MMBtu and
over $1.00 per MMBtu. Given strong demand in the United States, export
pipelines have been running near capacity all winter. Even the 1.3 Bcf per =
day
Alliance pipeline has been running full; through the end of the winter,
continued strong US demand should keep export pipeline flows near capacity.
Given these flow levels, CERA expects differentials to remain near the $0.6=
0=20
to
$1.00 per MMBtu level, reflecting the cost of transport on TransCanada, the
only available export capacity out of Alberta. For February, CERA expects a
differential between AECO and the Henry Hub of $0.65 per MMBtu.

Storage inventories in western Canada are running below historical average
levels, but the refill season should be manageable; inventories are nowhere
near as low as US inventory levels. Inventories in the West are expected to
fall slightly below historical average levels by the end of withdrawal seas=
on,
and exports should decline relative to first quarter levels as injection=20
season
begins in the spring. CERA expects differentials to Henry Hub prices to nar=
row
sometime in the late spring as the focus in Alberta turns from filling US
winter demand to refilling Canadian storage.

On the supply side, production has turned the corner in western Canada, and
year-over-year increases in supply of nearly 300 MMcf per day are now evide=
nt.
After flat production levels for 2000 relative to 1999, increases for the y=
ear
2001 should reach 350 MMcf per day. Given strong expected demand from
California and the West Coast, CERA expects no declines in year-over-year=
=20
flows
into the West on PGE GT NW. Overall flows should reach 2.4 Bcf per day for
2001, an increase of 85 MMcf per day from 2000 levels.

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift Toward Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2748;


***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

Northern Natural Gas declared a force majeure after discovering a leak in its 
20-inch Plymouth to Mitchell line in the Permian Basin area of West Texas. 
Teams isolated the leak, NNG said Wednesday, and the approximate downtime was 
expected to be two days. Flow was scheduled to zero at the Shell Tippett, 
Burlington, Marathon Yates and Southern Union receipt points. 

El Paso reported raising maximum flow through Pecos River Station, near the 
site of a pipeline explosion Aug. 19, from 700 MMcf/d to 750 MMcf/d effective 
on Wednesday's business day. El Paso will continue to evaluate the available 
throughput level while operating under the federal Department of 
Transportation's Corrective Action Order on allowable pressures in the Pecos 
River area.

Title: California's Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2241


California=01,s Desperate Attempts to Avoid a Rate Increase

On February 1, 2001, the California Assembly approved and the California
governor signed a new law intended to secure power supplies for California.=
=20
The
legislature has been meeting since early January in a =01&special extraordi=
nary
session=018 to address the power market crisis in the state, and the new la=
w
represents their first significant piece of legislation. The bill, AB 1,
establishes a new mechanism for purchasing power for the state=01,s busines=
ses=20
and
consumers. Whether the mechanism works will depend chiefly on whether the
limited revenue source used to pay for the power=01*collected by the state=
=01,s
investor-owned utilities (IOUs) under current retail rates=01*will cover=20
wholesale
power market costs incurred by the state. The law reflects the obsession by
California lawmakers with avoiding a rate increase rather than focusing on =
the
underlying flaws in California=01,s market structure.

AB 1 ushers in several important changes to the California market structure=
.=20
It
also contains several key provisions that capture the political mood in the
state. Highlights of the bill include

* Power buying authority transferred. The responsibility for purchasing pow=
er
for the customers of California=01,s IOUs has been transferred to the Calif=
ornia
Department of Water Resources (CDWR). The California utilities will continu=
e=20
to
operate and schedule their remaining generating facilities and contracts. T=
he
difference between the utilities=01, total load and the sum of their resour=
ces
(referred to as the utilities=01, =01&net short=018 amount) will be supplie=
d by CDWR,=20
an
amount of energy that varies between 5,000 and 25,000 megawatts (MW),=20
depending
on the time of year, time of day, and utility plant availability. The=20
utilities
most recently performed this function themselves, buying energy from the
California Power Exchange (PX). However, CDWR has been buying electricity o=
n
behalf of the IOUs since mid-January, when the near-bankruptcy of Southern
California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) threatened to=20
disrupt
supplies to their customers. CDWR is a state agency that manages water
reservoirs and transportation systems in the state. CDWR uses an enormous
amount of electricity to transport water across California and provides
critical load-shedding capability to the independent system operator (ISO).=
 In
addition, CDWR=01,s reservoirs generate power. The CDWR is thus well integr=
ated=20
in
the state=01,s electric grid but in the past has not executed large, compli=
cated
energy purchase arrangements to supply the customers of California=01,s=20
utilities.

* Portfolio of transactions. The intent of AB 1 is to allow CDWR to execute=
 a
portfolio of contracts to stabilize the cost of power for the utilities and
their customers. CDWR has until January 2, 2003, to execute contracts. CDWR
will take title to power and is thereby not just acting as a clearinghouse.=
 It
has issued a request for bids and seeks a variety of terms, including month=
ly,
annual, two-year, three-year, and longer. CDWR may also enter into options.
Thus, although CDWR=01,s role is intended to be temporary, the contracts th=
at it
executes could extend many years.

* Power for munis. CDWR may purchase power on behalf of some California
municipal utilities at the municipal utilities=01, election.

* New payment scheme. CDWR will be entitled to a portion of existing utilit=
y
rates to pay for the cost of purchased power, interest on bonds, and
administrative expenses. This payment stream will be equal to the differenc=
e
between the generation component currently embedded in utility retail rates
(averaging about $0.07 per kilowatt-hour &#91;kWh&#93;) and the utilities=
=01,=20
costs to run
their own generation plants, costs of bilateral and qualifying facility
contracts, and the costs of ancillary services. The CDWR share of retail ra=
tes
is referred to as the California Purchase Adjustment (CPA). It is not clear
whether the CPA will cover wholesale power market costs. Current prices for
multiyear power contracts may lie above the CPA. In addition, if investors
believe that the CPA is inadequate to cover costs, the entire program may b=
e
abandoned.

* New bonds. Bonds will be issued to secure power. The total amount of bond=
s
issued may not exceed four times the CPA. The state will transfer $500 mill=
ion
from the general fund to jump-start the program, which begins immediately.=
=20
This
seed money and all bond proceeds must be recovered by CDWR from the Califor=
nia
utilities=01, customers (and municipal utilities if they opt in).

* New residential rate freeze. The California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC) is prohibited from increasing residential customer rates until it ha=
s
completed paying all outstanding obligations. This locks in the recent 9
percent residential rate increase indefinitely. Governor Gray Davis thus ke=
eps
his pledge not to increase rates further.

* Retail competition. To help secure a stable payment stream for the new=20
bonds,
AB 1 enables the CPUC to prohibit the utilities=01, retail customers from=
=20
choosing
an alternative electricity provider until CDWR=01,s obligations are paid.=
=20
Although
the CPUC has yet to act on this, the action would effectively halt the
competitive retail markets in the state for the duration of the CDWR progra=
m.

* Taxpayer protection. AB 1 directs that the new bonds clearly state =01&&#=
91;
n&#93;either
the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of California is=20
pledged
to the payment of the principal of or interest on this bond.=018 Thus, the =
bonds
are secured only by the payment stream from utility rates.

*No assets affected. The CDWR is granted neither ownership nor control of
utility assets.

Ironically, the authority now granted CDWR is what California utilities had
essentially requested last summer when they sought to stabilize electricity
prices by executing a portfolio of transactions. The utilities were never
provided sufficient authority to execute term contracts. In addition, the
utilities have more experience to perform this function than CDWR.

Rather than aligning retail rates with wholesale electricity prices,=20
California
has sidestepped the issue by simply transferring the electricity purchasing
function. SCE and PG&E are still left to contend with uncollected costs fro=
m
past energy purchases, although they will no longer incur costs associated=
=20
with
buying power in the current wholesale market while charging frozen retail
rates. The utility liquidity crisis has not been resolved.

It is not clear whether the law=01,s prohibition on rate increases for=20
residential
customers can be achieved. The law is silent on rate increases for commerci=
al
and industrial customers, providing a potential path for recovering=20
higher-than-
expected costs. Alternatively, CDWR could conceivably find contracts of
sufficient duration and low enough price that the rate pledge is met. These
contracts would lock in today=01,s retail rates for a long period of time.

AB 1 is just one of the steps that state officials hope will restore the po=
wer
system in California to a more stable footing. Key tasks remain.

* California=01,s wholesale market structure, which helped cause the supply=
=20
crisis
by ensuring that it was not profitable or possible to build generation in
California, remains unchanged. The term contracts CDWR is likely to sign wi=
ll
provide a mechanism for mainly existing generators to lay off risk but will=
=20
not
be sufficient to encourage the build of sufficient new facilities. In=20
addition,
California=01,s siting and permitting process remains largely unchanged.

Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals 
A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. 
Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered "moot" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. 
"Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before" capacity became available, "it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were "null and void." The only "relevant" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. 
Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. 
It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. 
Richardson and Sempra "clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted," Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies "had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra," she noted. 
Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, "Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates," Miller testified. 
Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates.  In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more "willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available." But Miller counters that Sullivan "offers not support for his claim." 
She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data request by Southern California Edison, support Transwestern's claims. Both companies replied "no" when asked whether "any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate." 
The "capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictions, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, including Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate." 
Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit. Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller conceded that Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1.3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a "comparable" amount from Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a "substantially higher" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract, but she didn't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million. 
Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commission's negotiated-rate policy "does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits." 
Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan has suggested. This case "is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged."

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said.

Storage withdrawals have slowed markedly in recent weeks, attributable to both
losses of demand and warm weather. CERA estimates that storage withdrawals for
January have averaged approximately 18.0 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day.

* End-of-winter inventories are expected to be near 600 Bcf.

* Prices must remain high to keep demand off of the market.

* There is still potential for weather-related volatility.

Reliant Energy Plans to Form Two Public Companies

Reliant Energy said it plans to file with the Texas Public Utility
Commission a business separation plan under which it would divide into two
publicly traded companies to separate its unregulated businesses from its
regulated businesses.

The company plans an initial public offering of approximately 20% of the
common stock of its unregulated operations late this year or early in 2001,
assuming market conditions remain favorable. The company expects the IPO to
be followed by a distribution to shareholders of the remaining stock of the
unregulated company within 12 months. The remaining businesses, which are
predominately regulated, will be structured as a holding company.

The unregulated company will own Reliant Energy's unregulated power
generation and related energy trading and marketing operations, its
unregulated retail businesses, which currently include energy,
telecommunications and internet services, and the company's European
electric generating and trading/marketing operations. The plan also
contemplates that in 2004 the unregulated company will receive from the
regulated company cash equal to the market value of the regulated company's
interest in its Texas regulated generation operations. In addition, the
unregulated company will have an option to purchase the regulated company's
interest in these operations at a price equal to the market value.

The regulated company will include Reliant Energy's electricity and natural
gas companies, which serve about four million customers in the U.S. and
include Reliant Energy HL&P/Entex, Reliant Energy Arkla, Reliant Energy
Entex and Reliant Energy Minnegasco. Other operations in the entity will
include its U.S. interstate pipelines, its interests in Latin America and,
initially, its Texas regulated generation.

Note:  Official results not yet released.   Kern River currently has a 
project on file for an expansion to be placed in service on 5-1-02 for 
124,500 Dth/day at a cost of $80MM.  

Second Kern River Open Season Successful
Williams' Kern River Gas Transmission last week completed an open season for 
added firm capacity on its pipeline into Nevada and/or California amid rave 
reviews, although specific details were not yet released by the Salt Lake 
City-based interstate pipeline. 
"The results were outstanding," said a Williams spokesperson in Salt Lake 
City. "I mean they were huge, but we don't have that many details yet." The 
pipeline indicated it should have more information this week. 
New service resulting from this open season would be available May 1, 2003 
for terms of 10 or 15 years, the company said at the time of starting the 
two-month open season. The capacity dates are geared to coincide with the 
proposed opening of several new electric generating plants in Nevada and 
California, and since that date the call for added generation throughout the 
western states has been reiterated as it was at last Friday's Western 
Governors' Association energy roundtable in Portland, OR. 
Although Kern River has ruled out proposing new laterals, it has indicated it 
planned to help meet the increased gas demand for new power plants by adding 
compression and looping. The company has intends to finalize expansion design 
and rate impact analyses following the close of this most recent open season. 
Another open season last fall was held on an added 124,500 Dth/d of firm 
transportation capacity into California along Kern's 922-mile interstate 
pipeline from Wyoming (see Daily GPI, Nov. 16, 2000 <d20001116g.html>).

However, exposure to pricing disconnects will remain low until later this=

year.
CERA=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Pipeline bottlenecks out of the Rocky Mountains
this summer should begin to ease as heating loads climb
during October. CERA expects that as local demand limits
pressure on pipeline capacity, differentials will narrow.
October differentials should average $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. The resumption of flows on El Paso=01,s southern
system, combined with production outages, has relieved
some of the access constraints on San Juan supply.
Seasonal declines in Rockies to Southwest flows and the
beginning of the heating season should narrow October
differentials to $0.35 per MMBtu.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. The continuing pull on
supplies from the West will support Permian prices, and the
Midwestern pull on supplies will support Mid-Continent
prices. CERA expects a differential to the Henry Hub of
$0.06 per MMBtu for Mid-Continent supplies and $0.11
per MMBtu for Permian supplies.

* Chicago. The delay in the in-service date for Alliance from
October 2 to October 30 will take some gas out of the
Chicago market next month. This delay, combined with the
need to build Midwest storage inventories, should sustain
the recent increase in differentials from the $0.05=01)$0.08
range to above $0.10 per MMBtu. CERA expects October
differentials at the Chicago citygate to average $0.11.

* Northeast markets. Gas prices near $5.00 have increased
the fuel cost of delivery from the Gulf Coast into the
Northeast, raising the floor level for differentials to near
$0.30 per MMBtu. The beginning of the heating season and
the lack of new capacity into the New York citygate should
support differentials above the floor during October, at near
$0.40 per MMBtu.

Canadian Markets=01*Outages Affect Supply

Slight Drop in Export Demand
Eastern Canadian demand is still down approximately 200 MMcf per day, with

however, cooler-than-normal weather has accounted for an increase in demand
for heating requirements of about 200 MMcf per day.
Exports are down slightly in September compared with September 1999, with
PG&E GT-NW off 110 MMcf per day. Northern Border is running even with
September 1999.

Storage Picture Brighter in Canada
Storage injections in eastern Canada have picked up, with inventories now

Wider Differentials Holding
After widening substantially in August to US$1.17, the AECO-to-Henry

High Prices Force Chemicals to Sell Gas, Futures

Chemical companies, forced to shut in operations because of high natural gas 
prices, are nevertheless making money --- by selling gas futures contracts. 

Terra Industries and Mississippi Chemical Corp. became the latest companies 
to announce cutbacks related to current natural gas costs. 

Iowa-based Terra Industries said it had sold off a portion of its December 
natural gas purchases, and shutdown 50% of its Verdigis, OK, ammonia 
facility. The company had previously reported that it would not operate its 
Bytheville, AR, and Beaumont, TX, facilities during the month of December as 
well. 

In a similar maneuver, Mississippi Chemical Corp., a producer of nitrogen, 
phosphorus and potassium-based products in Mississippi, Louisiana and New 
Mexico, reported the sale of all of its natural gas futures contracts from 
January forward, in order to take full advantage of the opportunity uncovered 
by soaring natural gas prices. Mississippi Chemical said it expects to 
realize a pre-tax gain of $16 million in its second fiscal quarter ending 
Dec. 31 from the recently sold contracts. 

The problem lies in the fact that escalating natural gas costs are not being 
mimicked by chemical prices. An overabundance on the market has kept chemical 
prices relatively low, while gas prices, a feedstock for some chemicals, 
continue to climb. The difference in the latest shutdowns is that the 
companies involved have openly announced they have sold their gas contracts 
off because it is more profitable than manufacturing their products, said Ron 
Phillips of The Fertilizer Institute. 

Duke Energy's Ken Nyiri, divisional director of strategic planning and 
research, commented on Mississippi Chemical's transactions, "I guess they 
probably made about a $4/MMBtu margin on the gas, which is significantly more 
than they could make on the ammonia; in fact, they would have lost $30/unit. 
Their ammonia was probably costing them about $205/ton to make (with gas 
bought at $5/MMBtu in November) and the market today is at $205 so basically 
they would break even on their ammonia production costs. By selling the gas 
at around $9/MMBtu they made $4/MMBtu. It was just a question of do they 
convert the gas to ammonia and make nothing on it, or do they sell the gas 
and make $16 million." 

Michael L. Bennett, executive vice president of Terra, said, "The natural gas 
price increase since our December requirements were purchased for Verdigris 
permitted us to sell a portion of those purchases and generate higher gross 
profits than could be realized from selling the products manufactured with 
the natural gas. We will evaluate the economics of bringing Verdigris back to 
full production near the end of December when January's natural gas purchase 
commitments must be made." 

Terra estimates the idled facilities represent 40%, 30%, 77% and 88% of the 
company's North American ammonia, UAN, urea and methanol manufacturing 
capacity, respectively. The production of all four chemicals are heavily 
dependent on natural gas. Phillips said "The latest data we had in October 
was that of the companies that we survey, which is not the entire ammonia 
market, but a good bit of it, we were looking at operating rates of 76%." 

Currently, a total of 4-5 million tons/year of ammonia production capacity is 
out of service out of about 20-21 million tons/year of production capacity. 
"Clearly some of these folks have been selling their gas [rather than 
producing ammonia]," said Nyiri. "It's the prudent thing to do, I think, in 
this marketplace. Buy your ammonia if you can. At $9 gas, that costs you 
$350/ton to make the ammonia, which is $145 more than the current market is 
willing to pay." 

A spokeswoman for Mississippi Chemical said the company held on to its 
December gas contracts, and has been operating at varied levels of capacity 
throughout 2000 (see Daily GPI, June 30). "Depending on what the gas prices 
are, and what our product prices are around the January-February time frame, 
we will make decisions then on our operations rate [capacity]," said Melinda 
Hood, a Mississippi Chemical spokeswoman. 

Charles O. Dunn, CEO of Mississippi Chemical, said, "We remain committed to 
the nitrogen business and our customers, but we also have to take advantage 
of opportunities to optimize cash flow during these challenging times. It is 
our belief that the current unprecedented natural gas prices are unlikely to 
be sustained during the intermediate term," stated Dunn. "As a result, we 
felt it was in the company's best interest to sell our futures positions to 
lock in the substantial gain afforded by the recent increase in natural gas 
prices. Going forward, we will continue to determine operating levels for our 
plants based on the relationship between natural gas prices, nitrogen product 
prices and our customers' requirements, as we have been doing for some time." 

International imports are also hurting U.S. producers. Currently, there is a 
surplus of ammonia in the international market, which is holding ammonia 
prices down. U.S. fertilizer producers can't compete with the international 
market. Gas prices are 46 cents/MMBtu in Russia, 50 cents to $1/MMBtu in 
Argentina and Venezuela, and $1/MMBtu in Trinidad. The U.S. imports 5.5 
million tons of ammonia each year. Fertilizers represent 80% of the demand 
for ammonia in the United States. 

Terra Industries said its facilities would resume production as soon as it 
became economical again --- whether from gas prices declining or nitrogen and 
methanol prices rising, just as long as "prices reach levels allowing 
positive cash flows." 

Nyiri said he believes relief is in sight. He pointed out that the ammonia 
market has been sitting around the $205/ton level for the last several 
months, but believes ammonia prices will have to increase entering the next 
planting season. "I've got my model peaking out around $250/ton in April or 
May and at that time I have gas costs coming down." At that point, the 1-2 
Bcf/d of demand from the fertilizer production industry should begin 
returning to service.

Note:  EIA has increased their gas demand and price figures.  At the bottom 
of this synopsis, the web site address  will 
direct you to the full report released today if you would like further 
information.

EIA: Gas Takes Bigger Share Long-Term

A higher rate of economic growth will lead to a greater expansion in natural 
gas use than previously forecast over the next 20 years --- to 34.7 Tcf/ year 
in 2020, up from 31.5 Tcf --- and a 10% increase in projected prices --- from 
$2.81/Mcf to $3.13, according to the Energy Information Administration's 
latest report. 

EIA's Annual Energy Outlook 2001 (AEO2001) released today projects U.S. 
economic growth at an average rate of 3% a year over the next 20 years, up 
from its previous estimate of 2.1% per year. The economic growth will boost 
overall U.S. energy demand from 96 quadrillion Btu in 1999 to 127 quads in 
2020, up from the 121 energy quads projected by EIA one year ago (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 10, 1999). The increase in the projection for natural gas demand by 
2020 of slightly over 3 Tcf (loosely equal to 3 quads) is responsible for 
about half the change in energy projections. 

EIA says the 62% increase in gas demand from 21.4 Tcf in 1999 to 34.7 Tcf in 
2020, will be spurred by a tripling of gas use for power generation. During 
the next 20 years 89% of new power generation units will be fueled by natural 
gas. Gas prices are expected to decline within two years from current highs. 
"In the longer term, technology improvements in the exploration and 
production of oil and natural gas are expected to moderate price increases 
even as demand for these fuels grows." 

EIA projects world oil prices will reach $22.41/barrel (in 1999 dollars) in 
2020, up just slightly from the $22.04 in last year's forecast. 

The federal bean counters see a 1.8% average annual increase in power demand 
over the next 20 years, compared to the 1.3% they predicted last year. Prices 
will decline from the current 6.7 cents per kWh, but not as much as predicted 
last year due to the higher projected gas prices. Instead of 5.8 cents per 
kWh in 2020, EIA's AEO2001 sees electric rates holding at 6.0 cents per kWh. 

Power to be provided by nuclear generation jumped 34% from the forecast last 
year "due to lower estimated costs for extending the life of current nuclear 
plants and higher projected natural gas prices, although total nuclear 
generation still declines as some existing plants retire." 

Coal will still be the primary fuel for power generation, but its share will 
dwindle from 51% to 44% of the generating total.

Title: New Peaks, New Prices
Author: Zenker, Moritzburke, Snyder
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Western Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1247 ,

In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season, 
which, along with waning hydroelectric energy production and the more 
frequent use of gas-fired generators to meet demand, causes steadily rising 
power prices. CERA expects the West to be the only region in North America 
with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. Power prices 
already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as demand 
reaches its peak during the coming summer months western power markets will 
continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. 
The convergence of natural gas prices that are much higher than last year's 
levels, growing demand for power, and reduced hydroelectric energy production 
when compared with levels in 1999 is pushing up western power prices. 
Merchant and other gas-fired generators will be pressed into service, 
experiencing their strongest utilization rates since the drought year of 1994.

Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the West has supported 
western differentials and contributed to high gas prices throughout North 
America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, boosted by 
continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation and pressure 
across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation of summer 
power loads.

The main drivers of higher power and gas prices when compared with 
year-earlier levels will be

*  Peak WSCC load season. Summer weather will drive loads to the year's 
coincident peak, which is most likely to occur during the July/August period 
but could arrive any time during the June through October air-conditioning 
season. CERA expects demand growth of 3.1 percent in the third quarter 
compared with levels in 1999, which will push Western Systems Coordinating 
Council (WSCC) coincident peak demand levels to 2.7 percent over 1999 levels.

*  Waning hydroelectric output. Hydroelectric production is on its normal 
downward seasonal slide. This resource decline is more visible when compared 
with the 1999 hydro season, which was both abundant and prolonged.

*  High utilization rates for gas-fired generators. Growing demand for 
electricity, coupled with a declining availability of hydroelectric energy, 
will drive utilization rates of gas-fired power plants to their highest 
levels since the drought year of 1994.

*  Higher fuel prices. Western gas prices have remained at $1.00-$1.50 per 
MMBtu above 1999 levels. Growing year-over-year gas demand for power 
generation is providing much of the price pressure in western markets. These 
higher gas prices provide a boost to both on-peak and off-peak power prices 
of between $10 and $15 per megawatt-hour (MWh).

Regional Power Market Drivers

Power markets in the West are poised to break records for demand, peak load, 
and gas-fired plant utilization and, as a result, power prices.

A return to normal summer weather coupled with growing demand for power will 
push demand for electricity up by 5,274 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in the US West 
for the third quarter compared with 1999 levels, or almost 2,400 megawatts 
(MW) on average (see Table 1). This growth in the demand for electricity will 
also drive peak loads to new highs. CERA expects the 1999 WSCC coincident 
peak to be exceeded by 2.7 percent, climbing to nearly 119,000 MW. As was 
demonstrated by the mild summer of 1999, deviations from normal weather could 
boost or thwart this peak demand growth figure.

Two key factors will significantly reduce third quarter hydroelectric 
production levels compared with 1999 levels.

*  First, CERA expects West-wide total season hydroelectric production in 
2000 of roughly 100 percent of historical average levels, substantially lower 
than the approximately 120 percent of average in 1999.

*  Second, runoff was prolonged in 1999, serving to push a substantial 
portion of the hydroelectric production into the summer period (see Figure 
1). On average, CERA expects these factors will remove 9,187 GWh, or almost 
4,200 average megawatts (aMW), from the western resource base compared with 
1999 levels. Exacerbating this decline, refilling of reservoirs and flow 
restrictions to assist fish migration will cause periodic but significant 
curtailments in power production at key Pacific Northwest hydroelectric 
facilities.

Natural gas-fired facilities will be called upon to supply most of the 
expected increase in demand, while also replacing hydroelectric resources as 
they continue to decline. This will push average annual utilization rates of 
gas-fired combined cycle, steam, and cogeneration plants to approximately 38 
percent in 2000--levels not experienced since the 41 percent annual average 
utilization rate in 1994, a year marked by drought and warmer-than-normal 
summer weather. Utilization rates for these facilities will also surge past 
1999 levels, especially this summer. CERA anticipates a West-wide third 
quarter utilization rate of 59 percent for these facilities under normal 
summer weather conditions, compared with 46 percent for the same period of 
1999.

This level of utilization will certainly establish gas-fired generation as 
the floor to power prices during the third quarter, during not only the 
on-peak demand period but the off-peak as well. With natural gas prices at 
$1.00-$1.50 per MMBtu higher than 1999 levels, power prices are boosted by 
$10-$15 per MWh owing to fuel price increases alone. With supply tightness 
already evident in western power markets, the stage is set for increased 
price volatility compared with 1999 levels as episodes of hot weather require 
increased utilization of less-efficient generators throughout this summer.

Pacific Northwest

The water supply forecast for the Columbia River remains near average but has 
dropped a couple percentage points from last month. Flows are expected to 
remain at roughly 96 percent of average through September on the Lower 
Columbia and 103 percent of average on the Upper Columbia. Conditions overall 
are still sufficient to be considered average. This return to normal 
conditions in the Pacific Northwest should produce hydroelectric output 
nearly 2,700 GWh (18 percent) lower than last year for July and 8,405 GWh 
lower for the third quarter as a whole (see Table 2).

The region's load growth coupled with lower hydro supply will continue to 
elevate power prices in the Pacific Northwest relative to 1999 levels. 
Tighter supply conditions in California and the Southwest will attract energy 
exports from the Pacific Northwest, preserving a differential between the 
Pacific Northwest and California of about $1 per MWh on average.

Price differentials between the Pacific Northwest and California have varied 
dramatically recently, with the north at times rising above those to the 
south owing to local demand and hydroelectric constraints caused by reservoir 
filling operations. Since the end of May, volatility in both markets has 
pushed the difference between daily on-peak prices at COB and those in 
California from a premium of $120 per MWh to a discount of $55 per MWh within 
a few days. CERA expects that over the long run, California markets will 
clear at a premium as the summer progresses, but the differential will vary 
widely, with episodes of Pacific Northwest power pricing at a premium to 
those in California.

California

Despite below-average precipitation and snowpack this year, California 
reservoir storage levels throughout the state are higher than normal, ranging 
between 108 and 166 percent of average for the state's primary runoff 
regions. Under these conditions hydroelectric output should be roughly 4 
percent (363 GWh) below last year's levels for the third quarter (see Table 
2). With a return to normal weather conditions relative to third quarter 
1999, cooling demand this summer will increase most in California, where 
weather was nearly 30 percent cooler than average last year.

Recent day-ahead power prices in California have drawn attention to the West 
as the highest-cost market (if only temporarily) in North America. Record 
high temperatures and unscheduled unit outages produced new day-ahead price 
records, with power prices on June 15 at $457 per MWh in the day-ahead 
on-peak market and real-time hourly prices at the market cap of $750 per MWh. 
Increased utilization of gas-fired generation and daily gas prices of around 
$5 per MMBtu (burner-tip in Southern California) have kept daily average 
off-peak prices between $40 and $80 per MWh. Notably, these higher price have 
occurred during periods when roughly 1,800 MW more coal-fire generation was 
available in the West compared with the same period in 1999. CERA expects 
prices to continue to respond to the tight capacity environment this summer.

Rockies and Southwest

During summer 1999, the Rockies/Southwest was the only region to experience 
above-average cooling demand, suggesting that normal weather should bring 
only moderate demand growth of less than 1 percent (see Table 3). However, 
growing energy demand in neighboring regions and a large transmission 
transfer capability will pull energy from the Rockies/Southwest region when 
excess capacity is available, ensuring that prices in the region will remain 
tightly connected to price levels in other parts of the West.

Palo Verde prices have generally kept pace with other western markets, while 
maintaining their characteristic premium to the California Power Exchange 
during spring and early summer. CERA expects Southwest prices to strengthen 
relative to California when summer weather periodically shifts the locus of 
demand to the Southwest. However, California prices will maintain a premium 
on average to those in the Southwest, as the effects of the state's tight 
supply situation translates to higher prices than those in either the 
Southwest or Pacific Northwest.

Regional Gas Market Drivers

Under continuing pressure to inject gas into storage in the face of declining 
supply and increasing gas demand for power generation, gas prices at the 
Henry Hub are expected to average $4.45 per MMBtu in July. The strong demand 
for gas for power generation will keep differentials strong in the southern 
half of the West. In the Rockies, pipeline constraints will keep 
differentials wide.

The heightened call on gas demand for power generation, driven by the 
declining hydroelectric generation and increasing power loads, is expected to 
drive demand increases of 1.6 Bcf per day relative to July 1999 and 660 MMcf 
per day relative to June 2000 demand levels. Gas demand for power generation 
is expected to reach a monthly average record level of 4.9 Bcf per day in 
July (see Tables 4 and 5). These increases will result in declines in western 
storage injection rates and in exports from the West. Both Permian and San 
Juan supplies will be pulled increasingly toward the West Coast during July.

Low storage inventories and needed increases in injections are driving North 
American gas pricing. The West is the one US region actually running a 
storage surplus, but the recent heat waves and associated pull on gas 
supplies have eroded that surplus, particularly in California (see Table 6). 
Given the expected increases in gas demand, the western surplus should 
continue its decline. This decline and very high demand will reinforce the 
volatility in differentials already evident this summer.

California

Because of the early hot weather in the West and strong gas demand for power 
generation, Topock prices have been extremely high and volatile. So far this 
month, Topock has averaged over $0.30 per MMBtu above the Henry Hub. Flows on 
El Paso and Transwestern into California increased by over 300 million cubic 
feet (MMcf) per day during June relative to May averages, and flows are 
expected to continue to climb by an additional 400 MMcf per day during July. 
PGT continues to run near capacity (see Table 7). At the same time, the 
storage levels within California look likely to fall below last year's levels 
sometime during the month.

This intense demand pressure--California demand should increase by nearly 500 
MMcf per day in July relative to June--will keep utilization rates on import 
pipelines high and sustain Topock differentials. CERA expects the Topock to 
Henry Hub differential to average $0.30 per MMBtu during July (see Table 8). 
This high differential will likely persist through the summer, with 
differentials rising above $0.50 per MMBtu during West Coast heat waves.

Southwest

San Juan price differentials have been volatile, narrowing during periods of 
very high western demand. However, a very high utilization rate on pipeline 
capacity into California has widened the Topock-San Juan differential, and 
that wide gap is expected to persist. On average, San Juan differentials to 
the Henry Hub are expected to narrow from current levels as southwestern 
demand increases with western temperatures. Demand in the Southwest is 
expected to climb from 1.4 Bcf per day in June to 1.5 Bcf per day in July. 
This increased call on regional supplies and an expected strengthening in 
Permian prices should result in an average San Juan differential to the Henry 
Hub of $0.18 per MMBtu.

In the Permian Basin, prices are expected to strengthen as Texas power demand 
climbs. Combined with the pull on supplies from the West, Permian 
differentials should narrow from their current levels of $0.20 per MMBtu to 
below $0.10 per MMBtu.

Pacific Northwest

Strong June hydroelectric output has limited the call on gas supplies in the 
Pacific Northwest so far this summer, but as hydroelectric output decreases 
in June and July, gas demand will increase dramatically. CERA expects an 
increase of nearly 200 MMcf per day during July relative to June levels. The 
limited demand so far has meant differentials between Malin and the Henry Hub 
of as much as $0.30 per MMBtu and Topock to Malin differentials of over $0.60 
per MMBtu. The Malin to Henry Hub differential has narrowed slightly to 
around $0.20 per MMBtu. It should continue to strengthen with growth in 
regional demand and average $0.00 per MMBtu during July.

Rocky Mountains

Regional gas supply within the Rocky Mountains continues to increase, 
bolstered by continuing growth in the Powder River Basin. This April, exports 
out of the Rockies reached 3.2 Bcf per day, a record high. Although there is 
excess pipeline capacity out of the region into the Southwest on the 
Transcolorado and Northwest pipelines, high utilization rates have widened 
Rockies differentials with the rest of the West. In particular, Rockies to 
San Juan differentials have averaged nearly $0.25 per MMBtu for June after 
pricing close to parity earlier in the year. That gap should persist through 
the summer, as gas-fired generation climbs across the rest of the West. 
Demand is expected to average the same level in July as in June in the Rocky 
Mountains, where coal limits gas's gains in power generation.

CERA expects prices within the Rockies to gather some support from increasing 
power loads in the Pacific Northwest, as well as from stronger differentials 
in the San Juan Basin. On average, Rockies differentials to the Henry Hub are 
expected to average $0.52 per MMBtu during July.

In response to the increasing supplies flowing out of the Powder River Basin 
and the increasing pipeline capacity utilization on export pipelines, 
Trailblazer has announced an open season for two possible options to extend 
and expand the 500 mile pipeline from Wyoming into Nebraska. Although timing 
and volumes have yet to be announced, the additional capacity could prevent 
serious bottlenecks from developing out of the region, which CERA would 
expect by 2002 without capacity additions.

New Hurricane Forecast out of CSU

Renowned hurricane soothsayer Dr. William Gray and his team at Colorado State 
University have 
scaled back their forecast for the hurricane season but still expect the 
season to be more active than 
average. Seven rather than eight hurricanes are expected now and only three 
of them are expected 
to be intense rather than the four expected in the group's prior forecast on 
June 7. In round numbers, 
the August forecast is for three named storms, two hurricanes, and one 
intense or major hurricane. 

"Information obtained through July 2000 indicates that the Atlantic hurricane 
season in 2000 is likely 
to be less active than the four recent very busy years of 1995, 1996, 1998 
and 1999. However, total 
activity is expected to exceed the long term average and is anticipated to be 
considerably more 
active than the mean for the recent period of 1970 through 1994. 

"We estimate that the 2000 season will have seven hurricanes (average is 
5.7), 11 named storms 
(average is 9.3), 55 named storm days (average is 47), 30 hurricane days 
(average is 24), three 
intense (category 3-4-5) hurricanes (average is 2.2), six intense hurricane 
days (average is 4.7) and 
a Hurricane Destruction Potential (HDP) of 90 (average is 71). Collectively, 
net tropical cyclone 
activity in year 2000 is expected to be about 130% of the long term average. 

The early August forecast update is in close to Gray's Dec. 8, 1999) and 
April 7 forecasts, but 
somewhat lower than his recent June 7 update. "The forecast has been lowered 
slightly [because] 
June-July global circulation conditions have not progressed quite as 
favorably for hurricane 
enhancement than as we anticipated in our early June forecast," Gray said.

American Electric Power Buys Houston Pipe Line

American Electric Power Thursday announced it has made a major move to expand 
its wholesale natural gas business in the Southwest, agreeing to acquire the 
2.4 Bcf/d Houston Pipe Line (HPL) along with the Bammel storage field, one of 
the largest storage fields in North America, from Enron. AEP said since some 
details remain to be worked out, it was not disclosing the terms of the 
transaction at this time. AEP will be acquiring the stock of HPL and it 
expects to complete the deal in the next couple months. 

HPL, one of the two original pipelines joined by Enron Chairman Ken Lay to 
form the company in the mid-1980s, has an extensive 4,400 mile transportation 
and gathering system through southern Texas. The 118 Bcf Bammel field, 
located near the Houston Ship Channel market area, has a 65.7 Bcf working gas 
capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities. It has a 1.4 
Bcf/d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 MMcf/d injection capacity. 

"Adding HPL to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of 
becoming a top-10 gas trader and marketer," said Paul Addis, executive vice 
president for AEP. The company currently is second in the U.S. in electricity 
volume. "HPL will enhance AEP's natural gas business with its multiple 
connections into the production areas of Texas, its numerous interconnects 
with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around 
Houston as a premier provider of natural gas." 

AEP, headquartered in Columbus, OH, has numerous power generation plants in 
the Midwest and Southwest, including a number of gas-fired plants in Texas. 
In 1998 it bought the Louisiana Intrastate Gas (LIG) system. 

John Olson, energy analyst with Sanders, Morris & Mundy in Houston, said "for 
55 years HPL has enjoyed a reputation as one of the strongest pipelines in 
the country. As a stand-alone operation it is first class. It's a very, very 
strong asset." He said HPL has been showing losses of $50 million a year or 
more in recent years, "but those numbers are meaningless" because Enron has 
been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing 
efforts. Olson said the sale is a continuation of Enron's move to sell most 
of its hard assets and become a soft asset player. "They are emphasizing 
their trading. They are doing far better at trading." 

For one Houston-based risk manager, the sale of HPL by Enron was a question 
of rate of return. The competition among intrastates in Texas is fiercely 
competitive and for gas delivered to the Houston Ship Channel it can be a 
game of half-cents, with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates 
undercutting another to try to shave a profit, he said. Enron recognized this 
and wanted out, he speculated.

Kern River discovered a mechanical problem with an oil seal at the Fillmore 
Compressor Station in Utah. Fillmore will be inoperable while repairs are 
made Nov. 30, but no impact to firm capacity is expected. However, 
interruptible capacity will be reduced as necessary for the Nov. 28-29 gas 
days and will not be available Nov. 30.

Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing 
a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station 
remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline 
is invoking a "must-flow OFO" provision of its tariff. Until further notice, 
shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are 
required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north 
of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually 
agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem. See the 
Northwest bulletin board for details.

Did you see the following in the Gas Daily today?

Calif. approves Calpine plant
The California Energy Commission on Monday
gave the final go-ahead for Calpine to begin con-struction
on its 600-MW, natural gas-fired Metcalf
Energy Center in San Jose, the company said.
The approval follows a two-and-a-half year
battle against local interests opposed to the proj-ect,
which will be located in power-hungry Silicon
Valley. Calpine is partnering with Bechtel Enter-prises
to build the plant.
The initial tide of local opposition was finally
turned by widespread support for the proposed
facility from state energy agencies, Gov. Gray Davis
and environmental groups. San Jose's city council
had initially refused to give zoning approval for the
facility but changed tack after the groundswell of
statewide support and the seriousness of the
state's energy shortage became apparent.
"We have always believed this is an ideal
location for a plant, in a region without its own
local source of significant power generation," Ken
Abreu, general manager for joint development for
the companies, said in a statement.
Calpine and Bechtel will begin construction
next month, with the start of commercial opera-tions
set for the second half of 2003.

Title: Midmonth Report: Early Warning
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1420 ,

*********************************************************

After a warm October, the first cold weather this year
has provided an early warning of what winter could bring
for the gas market. Cold weather across much of the
great plains and a cold forecast for larger heating
markets in the Midwest and Northeast have driven a surge
in gas prices of more than $1.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) over the past week. This rebound
in price highlighted the continued tightness of supply
and moved the price of gas back above that of residual
fuel oil, assuring that dual-fuel loads remain off of
gas. Supplies for the winter are not adequate to allow
most dual-fuel end users to burn gas. If this cold snap
extends through the remainder of November, a heavy
early-winter draw on storage could set the stage for
unprecedented high prices through the winter.

Though storage inventories have reached near the 2,750
billion cubic feet (Bcf) level, they remain at a record
low heading into the heating season, and even a normal
winter would reduce inventories to a near record or
record absolute low by spring. This supply tightness
places the gas price playing field in the broad
territory above the resid price (near $5.00 in the Gulf
Coast) and into a range potentially testing the next,
difficult level of demand resistance. This resistance
could come from switching to distillate oil, but low
distillate inventories and high distillate prices mean
that switching would require a gas price above $7.50 per
MMBtu, and any move to switch to distillate would likely
drive prices of both commodities higher. Rather, a
combination of some switching to resid in industrial
boilers and a shutdown of a few more price-sensitive end
users may be required. None of these measures comes
easily or cheaply, however, and they can be overwhelmed
by weather-driven swings in demand. As a result, as cold
weather settles in, CERA expects heightened price
volatility at levels above the price of resid and
extreme sensitivity in the market to weather and weather
forecasts. Under normal weather conditions, CERA expects
Henry Hub prices to average $5.70 during December (see
Table 1), which by itself would represent an all time
high for December. But even this estimate could prove
low. If the current cold snap extends through early
December, prices could easily climb into the $6.50-$7.00
per MMBtu range.

Gas Storage-The Record Low Maximum
CERA estimates that storage inventories reached a
maximum of 2,746 Bcf as of the end of October, a record
low for that month by 64 Bcf (see Table 2). Even this
level was reached only through a fortunate combination
of a lack of storms in the Gulf of Mexico and consistent
warmth through most of October. The withdrawal season is
likely to have begun this week, however, and in a strong
way. The cold weather now settling in is likely to
offset warmth early this month, increasing the
withdrawal rate this November to 3.5 Bcf per day on
average, well above the 1.0 Bcf per day average rate of
the past two years. By the end of this month, the US
inventory deficit is likely to have widened again, to
350 Bcf.

CERA estimates that normal December weather would
require storage withdrawals of approximately 17.0 Bcf
per day, which is above last year's rate of 16.6 Bcf per
day. This year, however, this withdrawal rate would
apply consistent pressure in the market through December
and beyond, as it would keep inventories on a path to
reach 756 Bcf by the end of March, just below the 1996
all-time end-of-March low of 758 Bcf. So long as
inventories remain on this path the pressure does not
end even with the end of winter, as a significant
increase in injections next year would be required for
inventories to reach even 2.6 trillion cubic feet (Tcf)
by next fall. Although the supply build will begin to
help by late winter, it is unlikely to be of the
magnitude required both to offset power generation
demand growth and to allow this increase in storage
injections to occur-unless demand continues to be priced
out of the market.

Demand-Keeping Warm
After last year's warm winter, CERA expects a strong
rebound in heating demand, and this week's weather and
forecast reinforce that expectation. Weather last winter
(November through March) was the warmest of the decade,
and there will be a significant rebound in heating
demand in the residential and commercial sectors as
weather returns toward normal this heating season.

Under normal weather conditions,
* Average heating demand through the winter would be 3.5
Bcf per day higher than last year's.

* Monthly average heating demand through the winter
would be 36.7 Bcf per day, peaking at 45.6 Bcf per day
in January.

* December heating demand would increase by 4.8 Bcf per
day relative to last December.

Weather 5 percent colder than normal could further
increase December demand by 1.8 Bcf per day relative to
normal weather; likewise, a 5 percent warmer-than-normal
scenario could decrease demand by 1.7 Bcf per day
relative to normal weather.

Fuel Switching
With natural gas markets this tight, there is
significant pressure for demand to be backed out of the
market. Residential and commercial demand is inelastic
to price in the short run, which leaves industrial
demand and power demand as the only relief valve for the
market. This winter we expect

* all plants capable of burning residual fuel oil as an
alternative to gas to do so

* a loss of 700 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of
demand for power generation relative to last winter

* industrial consumers to switch the equivalent of 500
MMcf per day off of gas

* gas prices to act as a ceiling for residual fuel oil
prices, as much as resid will act as a floor for gas

For December CERA expects an overall demand increase of
4.5 Bcf per day relative to last December and a 14.4 Bcf
per day increase in demand relative to November, with
increasing heating load offset somewhat by fuel
switching.

Supply-The Rebound
The pressure from increasing demand and lower storage
inventories is intense, but US supply is beginning to
rebound. The recent steep decline in US lower-48
capacity is expected to reverse in late 2000, given the
soaring gas-related rig count.

* The success in reversing the decline in the Gulf of
Mexico is related to the combination of

- the ramp-up of the Hickory and Tanzanite subsalt
discoveries on the shelf, adding to the recent startup
of the Muni field; these fields could add over 0.5 Bcf
per day later in 2001

- the response of the shallow water to the strong
late 1999 turnaround in drilling activity

* Other important capacity additions are occurring in
the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, with 0.5 Bcf per day in
2000 and 2001, and onshore, led by the Bossier sand play
in Freestone County, Texas, the Barnett Shale play in
Wise County, Texas, and the Powder River Basin coal seam
play.

* Further increases in drilling are likely to slow. New
deep land rigs are under construction and shallow rigs
are being refurbished with cannibalized parts from older
rigs. Producers are experiencing delays in obtaining
rigs as the supply of quality rigs depletes and drilling
companies struggle to round out drilling crews.

Regional Markets-Wild Winter in the West
Extremely cold weather in the West has brought Rockies
prices close to parity with Henry Hub prices and
triggered early season spikes at Sumas in the north and
Topock in the south. Pipeline maintenance on El Paso is
exacerbating the regional demand pressure and has
contributed to Topock differentials of over $2.00 per
MMBtu. Tight pricing relationships to the Henry Hub in
the San Juan and Rocky Mountains should hold through
February, with significant widening in differentials as
heating loads decline.

Winter has arrived in earnest across North America, but
the start-up of firm transportation service on Alliance
is delayed once again, this time until December 1.
Nonetheless, flows on the pipeline are under way; CERA
estimates that flows during October averaged 450 MMcf
per day. During November that total should climb to 750
MMcf per day, despite the later published start date.
With or without Alliance flows, a weather-driven rebound
in midwestern demand relative to November and December
last year should keep prices in Chicago at a significant
premium to Henry Hub prices. In the Northeast,
differentials remain extremely strong and exposed to
spikes throughout the winter, despite greater flows into
the region from Atlantic Canada this year (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:
* Rockies. Very cold weather within the region has
brought Rocky Mountain prices near parity with Henry Hub
prices. A break in the cold or a cold snap in the East
will likely widen the differentials, but strong heating
demand in the region will keep differentials within
about $0.25 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects a December average differential of $0.25 per
MMBtu; however, this differential is expected to show
significant volatility based on regional weather. A warm
week in the Rockies could still push differentials
toward $0.50 per MMBtu.

* San Juan. San Juan prices will continue to hold close
to Rockies prices through the winter, with significant
pipeline capacity between the two regions. Heating loads
in the Rockies will determine the San Juan to Henry Hub
differential, with extended cold weather in the Rockies
pulling both prices close to the Henry Hub price. CERA
expects the December differential in the San Juan Basin
to average $0.20 per MMBtu.
* Permian and Mid-Continent. Unlike prices within the
rest of the West, differentials between the Henry Hub
and the Mid-Continent and Permian Basins are likely to
trade within a relatively narrow range during the
winter, as supplies from those basins are pulled either
east or west, depending on regional weather. CERA
expects a Permian to Henry Hub differential of $0.11 per
MMBtu and a Mid-Continent differential of $0.08 per
MMBtu for December.
* Chicago. Alliance flows into the Chicago market are
now running close to 750 MMcf per day. However, the
onset of the heating season has offset those increased
flows and pushed Chicago differentials up to near $0.15
per MMBtu relative to the Henry Hub, despite delays in
the completion of the Vector pipeline. CERA expects the
strong pricing at Chicago to continue, and December
differentials should average $0.25 per MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Assuming normal weather, we expect
to see December basis for New York relative to Henry Hub
at $1.03 per MMBtu. New England will likely see prices
$0.05-$0.15 higher, depending on the pipeline. Much of
this increased basis differential is caused by fuel
costs. For example, with a 9 percent retention rate from
the Gulf Coast into New England, last December would
have seen retention costs of approximately $0.22; at
$5.70, that same retention equates to $0.50. Despite
additional volumes of gas deliverable into the Northeast
from the Atlantic Canadian fields, there have been no
additional regional pipeline facilities to deliver this
gas to the local markets, and an additional 166,000
MMBtu per day of potential demand will compete for the
capacity. Because of this tightness, should this month's
weather be colder than normal, we could see severe
spikes in basis similar to those seen in January 2000.
These spikes could even exceed the highs seen in
January, depending on the severity of any cold snaps and
the extent to which new electric loads are realized.

Canadian Markets-Winter Begins
The colder-than-normal weather has increased demand in
western Canada but is only now being felt in the East.
Storage peaked in the West in early October at
approximately 225 Bcf below last year's level and 6 Bcf
below the five-year average. Even with modest
withdrawals since that time, storage inventories are
still estimated to be adequate to meet winter needs.
Easter Canadian storage has continued to grow, pushing
levels to over 245 Bcf, 11 Bcf above last year and well
above the five-year average. With the eastward movement
of the colder weather, withdrawals are likely to begin.
This higher level of eastern storage will be useful with
the expected reduction of flows on TransCanada.

The good news resulting from the cold is a more normal
"freeze-up," which bodes well for a longer winter
drilling season. Gas well completions are expected to
reach 8,500 for 2000 and will likely be even higher next
year.

Further Delays for Alliance?
The "commercial" in-service date for Alliance has been
delayed until December 1, the result of a combination of
problems with clearing the line, delays in the
completion of the Aux Sable liquids extraction plant,
the delay of Vector, and a lack of supply. The pipeline
has been flowing gas, however, with volumes building up
since September. It is estimated that flows for November
will average 750 MMcf per day. TransCanada has taken the
full brunt of the Alliance flows so far, with Northern
Border and PGT remaining strong. December should see
Alliance flows build to between 900 and 1,000 MMcf per
day, with modest reductions in flows on Northern Border
and PGT. Storage withdrawals will likely keep
TransCanada reductions close to 350 MMcf per day, year-
over-year, until Vector begins service to eastern
Canada.

High Prices: Strong Pull West
The high demand in the Pacific Northwest has also
provided strength for AECO. The AECO-Henry differential
has dropped to the high $0.30s and low $0.40s as a
result of this increased pull. For December, the
differential is expected to average $0.50 per MMBtu, for
a resulting AECO average of C$6.97 per gigajoule
(US$5.10 per MMBtu).

filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling 
that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in 
uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May 
when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned 
utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996 
levels. 

The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved, 
therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to 
the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public 
Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover 
its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit 
charge. 

"We're just keeping our legal options open," said a San Francsco-based 
utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect 
its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and 
another California utility on a "rating negative watch." 

State and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing 
investigations that California's current wholesale electricity market is 
broken and noncompetitive in its current state, said Roger Peters, senior 
vice president and general counsel for Pacific Gas and Electric. "However, 
there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for 
recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers 
must have, either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair 
prices, or through retail rates. These costs are continuing to grow." 

Noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale 
charges, PG&E's utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the 
charges from its almost four million customers, and it reiterated five steps 
it has taken to "increase supply, moderate customer demand, repair the broken 
wholesale market and provide stable, reasonable rates."

PRESS RELEASE:Utilicorp Unit To Develop Ariz. Facility >UCU
Jan 31 at 15:20

  ( BW)(MO-AQUILA)(UCU) Aquila Set to Develop Arizona Gas Storage Facility
  Business Editors
  KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 31, 2002--Aquila, the wholly owned
subsidiary of UtiliCorp United (NYSE: UCU), announced today that it has
purchased the Red Lake Storage Project from Southwest Gas Corporation.
  The purchase includes 36,000 acres approximately 30 miles north of Kingman,
Arizona, and the rights to develop a salt cavern storage facility. Along with
the land, Aquila purchased the water and mineral rights necessary to develop the
facility.
  The facility will have a gas storage capacity of 12 billion cubic feet (Bcf).
The first phase of the facility, with a storage capacity of 6 Bcf, is expected
to be in operation by the fourth quarter of 2003, with the full 12 Bcf planned
for the fourth quarter of 2004. The facility will connect to pipelines operated
by El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline and Transwestern Pipeline Company. Aquila
anticipates beginning an open season for the facility within the next seven to
ten days. In an open season period a company seeks storages commitments from
potential clients.
  "This facility fits with our strategy to build or acquire assets that enable
us to provide clients with the energy they need when they encounter dramatic
increases in demand," said Ed Mills, president and chief operating officer of
Aquila.
  The facility is positioned to serve Arizona power plants, as well as other
facilities in Nevada and California. There are approximately 60 gas-fired power
plants in Arizona, representing one of the largest single concentrations of such
facilities in the United States
  "Southwest Gas Corporation is pleased to see the Red Lakes Storage Project
being developed," said Ed Zub, executive vice president of Southwest Gas
Corporation. "Development of this project will benefit the states of Arizona and
Nevada where Southwest Gas Corporation serves more than 1.1 million customers."
  Aquila currently owns one of the largest independent storage facilities in the
southwest, a 21 Bcf facility in Katy, Texas. The company is also currently
completing the acquisition of a storage facility near Lodi, California, which
will provide gas to the frequently energy-short cities in northern California.
With the addition of the Red Lake Storage Project, Aquila will be one of the
largest independent storage providers for power plants and local gas
distribution companies in the Southwest.
  Based in Kansas City, Aquila is a leading wholesaler of natural gas, power and
coal in North America and provider of risk management services. Aquila also
provides wholesale energy and risk management services in the United Kingdom,
Germany and Scandinavia. Aquila is wholly owned by Kansas City-based UtiliCorp
United, an international energy company with 4 million customers across the U.S.
and in Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. Additional

Wood Signals That El Paso's FR Contracts Are High on Agenda 
FERC denied rehearing of a June order that permits Arizona Public Service Co. to assign its full-requirements (FR) capacity contract on El Paso Natural Gas to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy to serve a new gas-fired generation facility that it is building in Arizona. On the surface, it seemed a clear victory for the companies involved. However, Chairman Pat Wood made it very clear that he has concerns about FR service on El Paso, which entitles customers to unlimited capacity at frozen rates, and that he plans to take up the issue at a later date. 
"I will reluctantly go along with the order denying rehearing, but [I] look forward very aggressively to a forum in which we can address the capacity concerns" on El Paso, Wood said Wednesday during a marathon Commission meeting, the first over which he presided [CP01-90, RP00-336]. The proper forum for discussion of the FR service will be El Paso's Order 637 proceeding, he noted. 
As a lawyer, "it's hard for me...to find an excuse to grant rehearing here. Because this is not the appropriate docket to do that, I will concede that after four months of being browbeat into submission...that sometimes you ought to fold up," Wood said. "But I remain concerned about the [interplay] on the pipeline that if we don't engage in some long-term planning," the situation could "lead to a bedsore for the customers out there in the Southwest." 
The new chairman made clear that he was not "a fan or supporter of 10-year rate freezes or any extended rate freezes" that are made available to certain FR customers. "I understand that there's a tremendous disincentive here because of that for needed expansions to occur," Wood noted. 
He openly invited parties to challenge at the Commission the limits of FR service. He noted that FR customers "seem to have an unbounded upper-end, which I would love the opportunity to [address] if we ever get a contested pleading to define exactly just how full full-requirements can be." 
The "interplay" of frozen rates and unlimited access to pipeline capacity in a "growth part of the country that needs to have generation [makes for] a very complicated pipeline scenario," Wood said. 
In the June order, FERC gave the go-ahead for El Paso to construct and operate two delivery points and about six miles of lateral pipeline to provide service to the proposed gas-fired electric generation facilities of Pinnacle West and Duke Energy Maricopa LLC in Maricopa County, AZ. Pinnacle's 2,120 MW Redhawk power plant will require about 410 MMcf/d of gas, while Duke's 1,000 MW Arlington Valley plant will burn 210 MMcf/d. Both plants have scheduled in-service dates of June 1, 2002. 
Major producers and other El Paso shippers attacked El Paso's plan to provide FR service of 410 MMcf/d to the Redhawk plant, arguing that the service would further constrain an already capacity-tight El Paso system. Specifically, they objected to El Paso's plan to assign the FR contract (66,042 MMBtu/d) of Arizona Public Service to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy, as well as give a "huge increase" in the contract amount in order to serve the Redhawk plant. The protestors further argued that the plan would give Pinnacle West Energy a competitive rate advantage over existing contract-demand customers on the pipeline.

Second CA Merchant Storage Field Pushes Back Opening 
California's second merchant underground natural gas storage project near Sacramento began injecting supplies this month, but its commercial start-up date has been pushed back to Dec. 1, according to the California operations manager for Houston-based Western Hub Properties LLC, the developer. 
Although it is not fully subscribed more than half the capacity is under contract, according to Jim Fossum, the in-state manager for Western Hub, which was purchased last summer by a partnership of Aquila Inc and ArcLight Energy Partners Fund in a $220 million deal that is still several months away from approval from the California Public Utilities Commission. 
The Lodi Storage Project near the town of Lodi, CA, about 35 miles south of the state capital, will have "high-performance, quick-cycle-capabilities" in a project that stores 12 Bcf of natural gas with a 500 MMcf/d withdrawal rate and 400 MMcf/d injection rate. 
Fossum said Western Hub also is pursuing a second merchant storage project in the southern half of the state around Bakersfield in the Wheeler Ridge area close to the nexus of all the major interstate natural gas pipeline coming into California. That project, he said, is not included in the Aquila partnership purchase at this time, and will be developed initial by a still-to-be-named company using some of the same personnel that developed Lodi. 
The same group also has a potential storage site identified in Texas, near San Antonio.

Prudential Sees Bull Market Running Two More Years

With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price 
forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential 
Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead 
prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and 
$3.65 for 2001. 

"[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for 
another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'" the 
investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas 
fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired 
electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report 
stated. 

Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 
11% below last year's level. "This is assuming that the average injection 
rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and 
so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. 
Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 
Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
close to record lows next spring." 

Prudential expects supply tightness to continue even with the addition of the 
1.325 Bcf/d Alliance project, which is due to come on line next month. "[W]e 
question whether the Alliance pipeline will add incremental supplies to the 
U.S. or simply displace gas supply out of the Alberta region currently 
flowing down the TransCanada pipeline system." Prudential predicts Alliance 
will open up Oct. 2 with 600-700 MMcf/d of gas flowing. "The perception of 
the continued tightness in the gas supply picture is likely to result in an 
increase in volatility in natural gas prices." 

Prudential also estimates that 1.5 Bcf/d of gas demand has been added this 
summer by new gas-fired power plants going on line. "Over the past few weeks, 
over 2,400 MW of new merchant capacity has been added to the grid, equating 
to about 480 MMcf/d of capacity. Earlier in the summer, 3,600 MW came on line 
and another 1,780 MW started up in May. In aggregate, about 7,800 MW of new 
summer generation load could collectively consume 1.5 Bcf/d, which is likely 
to be diverted from storage injections." 

The firm estimates that wellhead deliverability will pick up significantly. 
The rig count has grown 48% since last year. Production from the deep-water 
Gulf of Mexico is expected to add 3.6-4 Bcf/d of new supply, "more than 
offsetting the deliverability decline, but shy of total expected new demand. 
We forecast gas demand will rise 3.1% in 2001, fueled by growth in merchant 
power generation." 

Prudential noted that on the books is another 37,000 MW of additional new 
gas-fired generation capacity to be installed next year and 43,200 MW in 
2002.

Title: Bouncing Above Oil
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2356


NATURAL GAS PRICES WILL BE SUSTAINED ABOVE $5.00

This spring and summer will present a major challenge to natural gas markets--refilling storage inventories while meeting underlying growth from power
demand. Achieving these goals will require some demand to be held off of the
market, which will in turn require gas prices to remain above those of
distillate fuel oil.

* CERA expects April to have the strongest injections since 1998.

* Gas prices will remain close to those of distillate through the end of
May.

* Prices will be volatile, as the market is still in a precarious
situation.

El Paso Shines Up Line 2000 for Gas Conversion 
El Paso Natural Gas this week received approval to begin the internal cleaning of its Line 2000, which would convert the former All American oil pipeline to gas service. The internal cleaning, or "pigging," will begin at the La Paz pump station, and when this portion of the conversion is completed, the project will add about 230 MMcf/d of new capacity by Aug. 31. 
El Paso bought the line from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. in early 2000.  It extends 1,088 miles from Emidio, CA, to McCamey, TX. The purchase also included any fiber optic rights that All American had along its entire 1,233-mile system. 
El Paso was awarded a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission certificate to begin the conversion project in May, and then began a binding open season for additional capacity, which extends through Aug. 2.  The open season is for 230 MMcf/d of capacity from the Keystone and Waha areas of the Permian Basin in West Texas to the California border near Ehrenberg, AZ. The expansion capacity will be made available by adding compression to Line 2000 from McCamey to Ehrenberg, with a projected in-service date of mid-2003.

Edison Mission Energy to build power plant in California

Edison Mission Energy, an Edison International company, is purchasing the
rights to the Sunrise Power Project from Texaco Power and Gasification. A
proposed power generation facility to be located in Kern County, Calif., the
project will bring both short- and long-term generation capacity to the
state, which is in dire need of new power generation.

The Sunrise Power Project will be completed in two phases. Phase 1 will
consist of a 320-MW, simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in
service during the summer of 2001. Phase 2 will convert the peaking facility
to a 560-MW, combined-cycle operation with an in-service date of summer
2003.

Final regulatory approvals should be received shortly for Phase I of the
project. Edison Mission Energy plans to seek expedited permitting approval
for the Phase II expansion in line with the fast-track approvals process
recently enacted by the California legislature.

Edison Mission Energy specializes in the development, acquisition,
construction management and operation of global power production facilities.
The company owns nearly 23,000 MW of generating capacity, including
interests in 75 projects currently under construction or operating in
Australia, Indonesia, Italy, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Spain, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States.

Breaking News: Cal-PX Shuts Down Trading 
posted 2:47 PM (CST) Jan 30, 2001 
In direct reaction to federal regulatory moves Monday, the California Power 
Exchange (Cal-PX) board decided to shut down day-ahead and day-of wholesale 
electricity markets by noon Wednesday, Jan. 31. Today will be the last day of 
trading for the day-ahead, and Wednesday the final day for the day-of, 
bringing to a close one part of the state's initial 1996 electric industry 
restructuring law that created the state-chartered, nonprofit public benefits 
corporation to provide a wholesale spot market through which California's 
three major investor-owned utilities were required to buy and sell all of 
their wholesale power. They are no longer required to do so. 
"Regrettably, Cal-PX must take this extraordinary action in response to 
Monday's FERC order that directs us to immediately comply with the terms of 
its Dec. 15 order and implement a $150/MWh breakpoint," said Cal-PX CEO 
George Sladoje, who noted that there is a Feb. 7 oral argument set for the 
power exchanges emergency motion and petition with the U.S. Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, requesting a stay and rehearing of the original FERC Dec. 
15 order. 
The Cal-PX will not close down entirely as yet. It will continue to perform 
all scheduling and settlement services for its current participants. "Forward 
contracts will be scheduled via approved alternative delivery mechanisms, 
assuring both buyers and sellers will not be inconvenienced or exposed to 
adverse economic impact as a result of the suspension of the day-ahead 
market," the exchange said in announcing the market closings.

***********************************************************************

WEAKENING DEMAND TO PUT THE SQUEEZE ON SPOT REFINING MARGINS

Oil demand growth is slowing dramatically in the aftermath of the September 11 
terrorist attacks. The combination of sluggish GDP growth and a sharp decrease 
in commercial air travel will in CERA's view result in declines in quarterly 
oil demand in fourth quarter 2001 and first quarter 2002. Spot refining margins 
are expected to trend downward, with the possibility of periods of upward 
volatility. Key factors that will influence the path of margins for the balance 
of this year and into 2002 include

*  weakening supply-demand fundamentals, as weak economies and reduced 
commercial air travel drive down demand

*  OPEC production policy and its effect on inventory levels

*  supply security concerns, including perceived risks of disruptions to 
physical supply that could result from new attacks or military action

WESTERN ENERGY MONTHLY BRIEFING:
PRICES REMAIN HIGH AND VOLATILE
Winter arrived with a bang last week, and the wild ride
in western gas and power markets continues. The early
cold together with maintenance outages on pipelines and
power plants, strong pulls on gas, and low storage
inventories pushed gas prices to new highs.

* Topock prices pushed over $10.00 per million British
thermal units (MMBtu) in mid-November, with Sumas and
Malin hitting $8.00. These price run-ups are likely to
continue.

* The pipeline-constrained Topock and Malin markets will
see swings from $6.00 to $12.00 per MMBtu on a week-to-
week-basis.

* November's cold snap demonstrated what CERA has
anticipated: continued power price strength and
volatility during the year due to gas and power market
supply tightness.

CA Power Market Awaits Bailout

California power watchers were hoping for results early this week from the 
marathon government-industry negotiations. The principals of last Tuesday 
night's marathon session were expected to meet by video-conference over the 
weekend to review solutions developed by staff working groups, which met 
through the end of the week. (see Daily GPI, Jan. 11) 

On the West Coast the week ended with emergency legislation starting its dash 
through the state capital, and the governor holding a 90-minute meeting with 
two neighboring western governors to piece together a regional strategy on 
joint energy conversation/supply cooperation. 

On Friday Gov. Gray Davis said if FERC fails to act, he is sure Congress will 
take up legislation to stabilize power prices throughout the country, "or at 
least give governors the option to opt into a stabilized pricing mechanism. 
Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-CA, announced she was working on a bill to be offered 
later this month, which would allow the energy secretary to impose price 
caps. 

Davis indicated that he and federal officials would be working over the 
weekend and he expects to have something to announce early next week, and in 
the long term he expects to "solve this problem in the next 90 days and in 
six months hopefully this whole episode will be a distant memory." 

Also on Friday Standard & Poor's assigned an investment grade triple B-plus 
corporate credit rating to subsidiary PG&E Energy Trading Holdings, and said 
subsidiaries Gas Transmission Northwest and PE&G Generating also would 
maintain their investment grade rating, based on each entity's own 
creditworthiness and economic self-sufficiency. These units would be 
insulated from any downgrades of the parent PG&E Corp., or the utility 
subsidiary, Pacific Gas & Electric. This action came after PG&E suspended its 
fourth quarter dividend and announced it was cutting staff and services (see 
Daily GPI, Jan. 12). 

Following their meeting in Sacramento Friday, Gov. Davis and his counterparts 
in Oregon, John Kitzhaber, and Washington, Gary Locke, announced a Feb. 2 
western governors' meeting would be held in Portland, OR, to push for a 
western region wholesale power price cap, and a region-wide push by each 
state to conserve energy and finally to share energy supplies on a seasonal 
basis. As fellow Democrats, Washington's Gov. Locke and Oregon's Gov. 
Kitzhaber expressed strong support for Gov. Davis's efforts and pushed for 
solutions from FERC 

"It is extraordinarily important that this not be a partisan struggle between 
West Coast Democratic governors and the inland governors who are mostly 
Republican," said Kitzhaber, noting that not all the solutions have to come 
from new generation. Conservation can play a major role, too. Both visiting 
governors said they strongly support the state of California becoming the 
purchaser of long-term power and then reselling to the utilities. 

They are banking on the fact that the state's creditworthiness will gain much 
better prices than the cash-strapped, near-bankrupt two major utilities, 
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. 

The lower house (Assembly) of the state legislature cranked out about a dozen 
proposed laws, including one to completely restructure the oversight boards 
of the state-chartered grid operator (Cal-ISO) and wholesale spot power 
market (Cal-PX) from large stakeholder panels of 26 to 30 industry 
representatives to small units of three people each --- all appointed by the 
governor. Another proposed law would prevent the state's three major 
private-sector utilities, including the two near bankruptcy, to sell their 
remaining generation units, which are comprised mostly of nuclear, 
hydroelectric and interests in out-of-state coal-fired plants. 

Gov. Davis indicated he expects state lawmakers to pass the bill this 
Wednesday, establishing three-person boards, and the members of the ISO panel 
will be the head of the state's three principal agencies overseeing 
electricity --- the California Public Utilities Commission, California Energy 
Commission and Electricity Oversight Board, of which two of the three are 
headed by Davis appointees. 

The near-rolling blackouts of Thursday, caused by storm-driven wave surges 
that curtailed power production at coastal plants, were eliminated over the 
weekend through stepped up conservation, restoration of major units at PG&E's 
Diablo Canyon Nuclear Generating Plant, and by what the grid operator called 
"the biggest single-day" lowering of demand he has ever experienced. This 
week Cal-ISO expects to have 5,000 to 6,000 MW that were out of service last 
week back online, further improving the chance of avoiding power emergencies. 

Salvaging the state's system last week at the critical Stage Three was 
California's water resources department, which operates the massive 
north-to-south network of aqueducts. It purchased 1,200 MW from out of state 
using the state's creditworthiness to get around the Cal-ISO financial 
problems. 

As it has done on a lower-profile basis in the past, the water resources 
department acted as a quasi-state power authority, and the Cal-ISO COO Kellan 
Fluckiger said that other market participants also are providing this sort of 
"intermediary financing" in light of the credit concerns surrounding the ISO 
and utilities. The water department also contributed to the supply crunch --- 
as it does routinely --- by shutting down its heavy electricity consuming 
pumps that move massive quantities of water around the state.

     Gas producers must be wringing their hands in glee as futures prices top 
$4.45/MMBtu, but some of their customers
     clearly are a little less than overjoyed. High gas prices are forcing 
some fertilizer producers to consider shutting down
     their plants and selling their feedstock on the open market just to make 
ends meet. 

     WEFA Inc. energy analyst Ron Denhardt estimates the gas industry will 
lose 25% (400 MMcf/d) of demand from the
     ammonia and urea industry this year because of the high price of natural 
gas. Other observers are expecting much larger
     losses, reaching as high as 1.5 Bcf/d. Denhardt also estimates the loss 
of an additional 1-2 Bcf/d due to fuel switching in
     the power production sector and possibly another 2.2 Bcf/d as industrial 
end users switch over to fuel oil. But those
     numbers are dependent on the comparative price of Nos. 1 and 2 fuel oil, 
both of which currently exceed the price of
     natural gas per Btu. 

     "Chemical and fertilizer companies who have hedged their gas supplies 
are better off shutting down their plants right now
     and selling the gas into the market," said one chemical plant supply 
manager, who asked to remain anonymous. "It's
     terrible. It's awful. About 70% of my contracts for sale are 
pass-through based on the cost of raw materials, and that's
     the only thing that is keeping me in business right now. We would not be 
making cost right now otherwise. We might be
     at a break-even point. And we hedged about 40% of our purchases back in 
September of last year, which was a pretty
     good time, looking back right now. We just have to plan it day by day. A 
number of fertilizer companies have closed
     up." 

     It's difficult to say when it becomes uneconomic to produce fertilizer 
because each plant is unique with its specific
     depreciation rate and costs, noted Dennis Lee, manager of energy and 
feedstock for Sask Ferco Products Inc., a
     partnership of Cargil and the Saskatchewan government. Lee's plant is 
one of the largest ammonia and urea producers in
     the world. It uses about 75 MMcf/d. Regardless of the unique 
circumstances of each plant, however, it's clear most of
     the companies will have to put out a lot of cash in the next few months 
to stay producing, said Lee. "From a credit
     perspective, some of the weaker companies may be in a credit crunch. 
There have been a couple of announcements of
     prolonged shut-downs in the Gulf Coast region recently because of high 
gas prices. 

     "People are getting antsy" because of a potential fertilizer shortage in 
the fall, he said. "Overall, I don't think it's a very
     healthy time for our industry. There could be some restructuring because 
of it." 

     He said it "doesn't look like" his plant is in any danger of a shut-down 
"at this point" because it is very close to its
     customer base in the Midwest and has a high efficiency factor, much 
higher than its older competitors in the Gulf Coast
     and Midcontinent regions. But the outlook does not look as good for many 
of his competitors, he said. 

     Procter & Gamble recently turned to energy procurement over the Internet 
in an attempt achieve greater purchasing
     efficiency and lower prices. It is posting requests for quotes (RFQ) for 
a number of its facilities on a new transaction
     website, www.energygateway.com, as part of its exploration of new 
avenues for supply acquisition. "We're in the early
     stages of experimenting with this," a P&G buyer said. (See Daily GPI, 
June 13) P&G, which like most very large energy
     using manufacturers, continues to do its buying and risk management 
in-house, plans to post more RFQs on the
     energygateway.com website. 

     "We're looking for other opportunities to try out and evaluate. We're 
always looking for ways to bring value to our
     company," the P&G buyer said. "It's not a good time to be a buyer in the 
energy market. We're re-evaluating our
     approaches. We don't want to just be a victim of the market."

Subject:	Quick update on El Paso capacity allocation conference

Today's technical conference (RP00-336) was not the snazzy show we perhaps expected.  With El Paso having done 5 studies on different allocation scenarios, shippers requested four more, showing seasonalization impacts and the difference between CD and Full Requirements shipper Coincidental and Non Coincidental Peaks.  

Though there were some FR vs. CD shippers discussions, they did not reflect the battle we see going on in the two complaints filed this summer by 
the TX, NM and AZ FR shippers and Aera Energy (CD shippers).  There was also no mention of converting FR shippers to CD service.

The primary issue here ended up being procedural, with the decision still up in the air if this should be set for hearing or a merits decision from the Commission (or settlement, though that seems very likely -- merits decision is the most likely case).

Also never mentioned were the CD and FR complainants proposals that El Paso dedicate currently proposed expansions to existing shippers or requiring mainline system expansion for existing service (RP01-484 and 486).

The procedural schedule has been set:
	El paso further studies and answers to questions posed at conference or in writing:   Sept. 24
	Initial comments (on all capacity allocation issues and procedural recommendations): Oct. 15
	Reply comments:  Oct. 26

I'll send a more detailed report, but wanted to get the quick info. out to those most interested.

Climate Prediction Center Winter  Outlook
?
??? The Climate Prediction Center,  a unit of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, discusses the  outlook for this winter. The 
agency does not expect El Nino and La Nina to  affect global weather for the 
next nine months. The two weather patterns, which  occur because of changes 
in ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, directly  influence US rain 
patterns and land temperatures. The CPC says this winter will  be the first 
year in three that the US has not had a strong influence from this  
particular climate-driving force. But, that does not mean there will be a 
whole  lot of difference in terms of when winter will start. It will have 
something to  do with temperatures, because both La Nina and El Nino have 
tended to make  temperatures moderate in the winter.? The CPC expects that 
this winter  nationwide on average will still be slightly warmer than normal, 
but not as warm  as the last three. The northern part of the nation and 
particularly the  Northeast, however, could be an exception with colder 
weather. The warmer  pattern will be confined more to the West and the South. 
East of the Mississippi  with the exception of Florida should be cooler this 
winter and most of  California and the northern half of the Rockies and the 
Dakotas. For the fall  and winter, expect the Southwest to be the mild and 
dry.

El Paso South Mainline Shut-in Extended

The U.S. Transportation Department's Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) has 
ordered all three of the pipes comprising El Paso Natural Gas' 1 Bcf/d South 
Mainline from Texas to California to remain closed until extensive tests can 
be done to ensure they are safe to operate. 

The order came in the wake of Saturday's explosion and fire that ripped 
through one of those lines, the 30-inch pipeline 1103, at a Pecos River 
crossing near Carlsbad, NM, killing 11 people. 

Because of the internal corrosion discovered on the failed section of 
pipeline, OPS is directing El Paso to submit a corrective action plan for OPS 
approval that will identify all areas on approximately 330 miles of pipeline 
that may be subject to internal corrosion," said Kelley S. Coyner, head of 
the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) for the OPS, in a 
prepared statement. 

The DOT "is requiring that all segments of the three pipelines in the 
vicinity of Pecos River remain closed until such time that the department has 
determined that the pipeline segments are safe to operate." This is necessary 
to "protect the public and the environment and to prevent a similar failure 
on this pipeline system." 

The plan will require inspection, assessment, and repair or replacement of 
all damaged areas. 

"Based on the results of these and other tests, El Paso must develop a plan 
to assess the integrity of the remainder of its 10,000 mile pipeline system." 

The OPS "Corrective Action Order" was issued late Wednesday, after El Paso 
officials had been saying for most of the day it was only a matter of hours 
before at least one of the lines was back in operation. One industry source 
said testing could easily take three weeks to a month, even if no repairs are 
necessary. 

The OPS order directs El Paso to: 1) conduct hydrostatic pressure testing of 
the lines; 2) perform a direct assessment of the integrity of the pipelines 
by both X-ray and ultrasonic examinations; and 3) because internal corrosion 
has been detected in the failed section of the pipeline, El Paso also must 
submit a corrective action plan to OPS identifying all areas on the 
approximately 330 miles of pipeline that may have internal corrosion. 

Even if El Paso passes all these tests and OPS allows it to return to 
service, each of the three lines will be subject to a 20% pressure 
restriction, according to Coyner. The restriction will be reviewed in 10 
working days, and may be removed upon the receipt of more information about 
the factors that contributed to the Aug. 19 explosion. OPS has the authority 
to take other actions if warranted. 

The OPS yesterday issued the seven-page corrective action order, which 
permits it to suspend or restrict the operations of a pipeline, after it 
determined that the El Paso lines were hazardous. El Paso has been notified 
of the order, and it has 10 days to request a hearing to be held in either 
Houston or Washington DC. If El Paso fails to comply with any part of the 
order, it could face civil penalties of up to $25,000 a day, and the case 
could be referred to the U.S. Attorney General for "appropriate relief" in 
the U.S. District Court, according to Stacey Gerard, associate administrator 
for pipeline safety. 

Preliminary investigations of ruptured Line 1103 by the OPS and the National 
Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) indicate that "significant internal 
corrosion was visible on the failed section. Internal corrosion may have been 
a contributing factor in the line failure. The possibility of internal 
corrosion on other lines in the area is a safety concern." 

The OPS order applies to the 30-inch Line 1103, which incurred the most 
damage, and the parallel 26-inch Line 1100 that "sustained an undetermined 
amount of damage at the Pecos River crossing due to the fire." It also covers 
the adjacent 30-inch Line 1110, whose damages are still undetermined. Lines 
1103 and 1110 were built in 1950, and Line 1100 in 1947. 

Within 90 days, El Paso will be required to submit to the OPS Southwest 
region director an "analysis of the continued safe operation" of the three 
lines "based on the testing and inspection required under this order." 

In related action. Rep. John Dingell (D-MI), who has been a sharp critic of 
OPS for its allegedly lax handling of pipeline safety violators, is in the 
process of drafting a letter to the agency to determine whether its failure 
to take aggressive action towards pipelines may have created an atmosphere 
that led to the tragedy on El Paso.

Note the discussion on market share halfway through the article.

Top Gas Gorillas Show Strong Volume Growth
The year 2000 was a banner year for the top players in gas marketing, with 
huge increases in gas prices, enormous volatility, continuing growth in sales 
volumes and major potential for profits. Physical gas sales volumes for the 
top 20 marketers in NGI's ranking grew 17% to nearly 150 Bcf/d, and profits 
among the larger players came in very strong with companies such as Williams 
reporting 2,000% profit increases in their energy merchant segments. 
However, for many of the smaller players it was a tough year. "The big news 
here is probably the price pressure the marketers have had to withstand," 
said Ben Schlesinger, president of Maryland-based consulting firm Schlesinger 
and Associates, which tracks energy marketing. "These people have price 
exposure on both sides of their business: the buy side and sell side. They've 
actively sought to hedge these risks, but there's no question that there have 
been some real stresses in their businesses as a result of quadrupling gas 
prices in 2000." 
Significant shuffling has begun to take place and will continue, not just 
among the leadership but among the whole roster of 500 marketing companies, 
predicted Schlesinger. "For the first time I'm not sure all 500 will make it 
because of the price volatility, and the stresses that it creates on their 
balance sheets and their ability to meet the different needs of their 
customers." If you are on the wrong side of a transaction these days in 
California, you are going to suffer significantly. It's not much different at 
the Henry Hub either, he noted. The harsh reality is that only the strong 
will survive. 
Ronald J. Barone of UBS Warburg believes the California energy crisis and 
fears of lack of gas supply and capacity are driving customers to the 
strongest marketers. "I think that over the long term it will be a positive 
for the bigger players, such as Enron. Customers want to go with somebody who 
is big, has facilities, somebody who is going to guarantee it, somebody who 
can do risk management for them. Enron is the 800-pound gorilla here." 
Enron has been the 800-pound gorilla in gas marketing for years but there 
were always plenty of 750-pound gorillas around. Last year, however, Enron 
found a way to trade natural gas over the Internet and at last glance was 
well over 1,600 pounds, more than double the size of its next closest rival 
gorilla, Duke Energy. Enron sold 23.8 Bcf/d of gas last year compared to only 
13.3 Bcf/d the year prior and compared to the 11.9 Bcf/d sold by Duke Energy, 
which came in second place in NGI's ranking of gas marketers by physical 
sales volume. 
Enron catapulted itself to the next level with the help of its handy new 
tool, EnronOnline, its web-based proprietary energy and commodity trading 
system that now handles about 3,000 mainly natural gas transactions each day. 
In 2000, Enron completed its first full year of deploying EnronOnline, which 
quickly became the world's largest web-based e-commerce site. During the 
year, Enron executed 548,000 transactions online with 3,000 customers, 
totaling $336 billion of gross value. 
The tremendous success of EnronOnline led many observers to wonder whether 
market concentration was beginning to take place in the industry. When you 
look at Enron's massive increase in wholesale transactions you have to wonder 
about that concentration. Enron's 23.8 Bcf/d is pretty large (35%) when 
compared with the 69 Bcf/d that is actually consumed in North America. But 
you have to factor in multiple trades --- one marketer trades a given 
molecule of gas to another marketer and so on. According to Schlesinger, the 
so-called "churning factor" is close to three. 
"In the past several years when we've been polling marketers, we got numbers 
(in 1999) that came to about 60 Tcf. We added up all the physical sales by 
all the marketing companies. We did not have 100% response in our survey --- 
some of the mid-sized and smaller companies didn't respond. We reasonably 
extrapolated that about 65 Tcf, maybe even 70 Tcf of gas was traded each year 
in North America. Physical consumption in North America is about 25 Tcf so 70 
divided by 25 is about 2.8." 
Using that calculation, Enron with 23.8 Bcf/d of physical gas sales in 2000 
ends up with a not unreasonable 12% market share. When the Federal Trade 
Commission looks at markets and market share, it uses several tools, one of 
which is the Herschman-Herfindahl Index, a measure of market concentration. 
It's the sum of the squares of the market share of each participant. If one 
company owns the entire 100% of the market, that's an HHI of 10,000. 
The Department of Justice has been using 1,800 as a red flag when it 
considers approval of mergers and acquisitions. According to Schlesinger, the 
total gas industry has an HHI of only about 200, way below any suggestion of 
market concentration. 
"It's so low that it's unbelievable. It's a highly competitive business. Even 
if one competitor has 12% of the market (HHI of 144) and the next competitor 
has 6% and on down, it certainly doesn't send up any red flags," he said. "It 
could be that market concentration in the gas industry has risen a bit in 
2000, but this information alone would not diminish the fact that the 
industry is one of the most competitive businesses in the United States. 
However, there may be some regional issues we have to think about," he added. 
"We haven't looked at that, so I can't comment on whether anyone has undue 
market power in a particular region or state, for example." 
There is a snowball effect going on among the top marketers. The leaders keep 
getting larger. Volume growth averages at least 10% per year or more. Several 
factors should fuel future growth. Price increases, volatility and 
uncertainty of supplies are driving buyers to the larger marketers, according 
to both Schlesinger and Barone. Online trading has become a new springboard 
for additional growth by allowing greater efficiency and many more trades to 
take place. 
Schlesinger said he believes electronic trading was responsible for a good 
part the 17% increase in volumes. Enron attributed much of its growth to the 
online business. 
According to some observers, online trading still has plenty of room to grow. 
Altra Energy CEO Paul Bourke believes about 30% of all gas trading now takes 
place over the Internet. Bourke said Altra had 8,000 natural gas trades on 
its system in December. 
However Barone predicts there eventually will be a slowdown in gas marketing 
growth in the United States as international energy markets grab the 
attention of many marketers. "International should pick up the slack and 
contribute increasingly to the bottom line," he said. Barone also expects the 
current market situation and the continued interest in service, supply and 
commodity versatility to continue driving marketing companies together. "I 
think size, scope and scale are incredibly significant." 
Only one of the top 20 major marketers last year resulted from the 
combination of two separate predecessors: Axia, which grew out of the 
combination of Koch Energy and Entergy. The rest of the group achieved its 
growth without major acquisitions or mergers. 
Thirteen out of the 20 top marketers showed double- or triple-digit volume 
growth with only two companies in the minus column. PG&E had the largest 
volume deterioration of any of the large marketers with a 40.1% decline in 
annual volumes and a 42% decline in quarterly volumes. PG&E went through a 
significant reorganization last year. The move of its National Energy Group 
(NEG) to Bethesda, MD, from Houston, had the greatest impact on its trading 
activity. But the company also sold its energy services business and its 
Texas gas transmission assets among other changes. "It really slowed down our 
trading [and] a large number of people stayed behind in Houston," said 
company spokesman Patrick Hurston. At the time of the move, the company 
estimated about half, or 100, would make the move. Hurston wouldn't say how 
many actually made the trip, but the company is still actively hiring. 
TransCanada, which also underwent a massive reorganization last year, was the 
other company in the minus column with a 3% decline in sales volume. 
The remainder of the group experienced large increases in volumes: Enron at 
94%, Duke with 15% growth, Sempra with 51% and BP Amoco with 100% growth.

FERC Restructures California Power Market

Responding to a California power market gone haywire and teetering on the 
brink of operational and financial disaster, FERC Friday issued a series of 
remedial measures, virtually stripping the Cal-PX and Cal-ISO of their 
control of the market and calling market stakeholders together to negotiate 
bilateral forward contracts. 

The Commission's main action, effective with the issuance of the order after 
the Friday afternoon meeting, removes the requirement that California 
utilities buy and sell exclusively through the California Power Exchange 
(Cal-PX) and clears the way for bi-lateral contracts in the forward market. 
FERC scheduled a settlement conference for Dec. 19 in Washington of parties 
in the state's power market to negotiate those contracts. 

"California does [not] have the benefit of a competitive market," Chairman 
James Hoecker said, noting he had heard the state's power market called 
"crisis by design." The design was "an unworkable state law, the product of 
command and control that described in detail" exactly how the market should 
function. "It wasn't competition," Hoecker said. "It's time to get serious 
about saving the future of competitive markets...Competition did not fail in 
principle at either the wholesale or retail level because it was never 
well-conceived or tried. This version of competition was a disaster." 

Commissioner William Massey defended the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission's backing away from price caps. "Rather than cap the spot market 
created by the state of California, the order would simply shrink its size 
and diminish its influence." This will "give back participants' ability to 
find the right price; This ability is what California has taken away from 
that market." 

Massey said the action would allow bilateral transactions, support forward 
contracts, and allow the parties to manage risk. He urged the California 
Public Utilities Commission to "step up to its responsibilities" in 
supporting the FERC-directed activities. 

Massey said the transfer of wealth in what he described as the "apocalypse" 
in California "is absolutely staggering. The two largest utilities are 
virtually bankrupt." He predicted a court, acting on accepted law and 
precedent, would eventually rule the utilities are entitled to recover the 
costs from customers, spreading the costs out over the entire state. 

PG&E Corp. officials lambasted the Commission's actions, saying they left 
California's electric customers "exposed to price gouging and future electric 
supply reliability uncertainty." 

"The California wholesale market is broken. And we are extremely disappointed 
by the insufficiency of today's FERC order," PG&E officials said in a 
statement. "The remedies outlined in the order do not go nearly far enough to 
provide a solution that ensures reliability of the state's electric supply 
and equally importantly, provides relief from future price gouging," the 
Northern California utility company said. PG&E said it was particularly 
disappointed that FERC did not call for retroactive price refunds for 
California electric customers, as was requested by Gov. Gray Davis. The 
utility also said it was "especially troubled" that FERC shortened the 
timeframe for the electric price cap from the end of 2002 to April 2001, 
"leaving customers exposed during the high-demand summer season." 

Sen Dianne Feinstein, (D-CA), said FERC's action was unacceptable. "Rome is 
burning, our utilities are close to bankruptcy, Californians are facing major 
blackouts, and the Commission is fiddling." 

Hoecker said similar competitive problems in states in the Pacific Northwest 
have led to pleas from governors and others for regional price caps. But he 
pointed to the fact that FERC is severely limited in what it can do in that 
region. For one, it lacks authority over the Bonneville Power Authority and 
other federal operations there, which make up a major portion of the market. 
Further, there is no Northwest spot market that can be capped in the way caps 
operate in California. There also would be problems with the many purchasers 
who already had hedged or protected themselves in some way. Hoecker strongly 
urged Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to convene a conference to try to 
identify regional problems, and offered his help in this. 

Commissioners Curt Hebert and Massey said they would issue concurring 
opinions. Hoecker said he will submit a concurring opinion next week on items 
such as RTOs that are beyond the scope of the order. The Commission's 
actions, which went beyond recommendations it had made earlier (see Daily 
GPI, Nov. 2), came at an emergency meeting following a week of continuous 
power alerts and emergency measures to avoid rolling blackouts in the state. 

The Commission's reforms call for: 

 No retroactive refunds for California customers; 

 Elimination of the requirement that California's three investor-owned 
utilities --- Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison --- sell all of their power into the Cal-PX, and 
buy all of their power from the Cal-PX. This took effect Friday; 

 Return 25,000 MW of generation to state regulation; 

 Termination of the Cal-PX wholesale rate schedule effective the close of the 
trading day on April 30, 2001; 

 Create a benchmark price for wholesale bilateral contracts to assess prices 
of five-year energy supply contracts; 

 Create penalties for underscheduling power loads; 

 A requirement that market participants schedule 95% of their load prior to 
real time. Violators will incur penalties for scheduling deviations exceeding 
the greater of 10 MW or 5% of their hourly load; 

 Begin market monitoring and price mitigation for the Cal-ISO and PX spot 
markets. FERC will hold a technical conference to develop a monitoring an 
mitigation program. A proposed plan is to be submitted by March 1 so that the 
measure can be in place by May 1; 

 A single-priced auction to be used only for bids at or below $150/MW. Bids 
above $150/MW will not set the market clearing price, although they will be 
subject to FERC reporting requirements; 

 Replacing the current Cal-ISO stakeholder governing board with a 
non-stakeholder board. On Jan. 29, 2001, the Cal-ISO governing board members 
will be required to turn over their decision-making power and operating 
control to the management of the Cal-ISO. The members will be permitted to 
function in an advisory capacity until the new board is selected. FERC to 
discuss with California representatives a process for selecting new Cal-ISO 
board members; and 

 Modify interconnection procedures. The ISO and utilities must file 
generation interconnection procedures.

Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets

To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast 
Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old 
marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based 
gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week. 

Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16 
billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and 
company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed 
before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage 
venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in 
Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs 
300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas 
from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within 
all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural 
gas deliverability by the end of this year. 

NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers 
list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage 
reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the 
previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999. 

Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of 
energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity 
trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and 
transportation-related services, structured power and management services and 
energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would 
continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's 
existing asset valuation. 

Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian 
business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United 
States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name 
and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other 
U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with 
headquarters in Houston. 

"By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and 
trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience, 
track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three 
years," said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO. 

When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already 
has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas 
marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year. 
It also was ranked seventh in 1998.

Title: High Speed Regulation in California
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=3D35&m=3D2208


A Feverish Pitch
The pace of regulatory and political events in California has taken on the
feverish pitch of the energy market crisis itself. Important decisions
regarding a wide range of market structure issues are being made quickly at=
=20
the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the state Legislature,
increasing the level of uncertainty most market participants already percei=
ve
in the quickly evolving California market. Sudden changes are being made to=
=20
the
market structure, changes that used to require years in California=01,s com=
plex
regulatory and legislative proceedings.

As rolling blackouts have rippled through urban centers of Northern Califor=
nia
on January 17 and 18, including in portions of downtown San Francisco,
Sacramento, and the Silicon Valley, state officials are scrambling to set u=
p
the appropriate credit mechanisms to ensure the continued delivery of scarc=
e
western energy supplies to California=01,s two largest utilities. Even at p=
rices
near $800 per megawatt-hour (MWh), the California Department of Water=20
Resources
(CDWR), attempting to buy power on behalf of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E=
)
and Southern California Edison (SCE), has been unable to secure enough to k=
eep
the lights on. In the mean time, legal actions by some energy suppliers
threaten to tip the utilities into bankruptcy=01*and are being held at bay =
only=20
by
direct intervention of California=01,s governor.

Below is a summary of the various state actions being pursued concurrently:

*California governor. California Governor Gray Davis continues to attempt t=
o
act on behalf of PG&E and SCE to secure long-term contracts for supply from
merchant generation owners and marketers in California. On the same front, =
the
governor has been negotiating with generators in an attempt to keep them fr=
om
seeking compensation through the courts for energy delivered to the utiliti=
es.
Court-ordered reimbursement could prompt bankruptcy.

*Legislature. Bills have been approved to authorize continued power purchas=
es
on behalf of PG&E and SCE by the CDWR, to restructure the independent syste=
m
operator=01,s (ISO) governing board to consist of five members appointed by=
 the
governor, to restrict the ability of the ISO to enter into a broader=20
interstate
regional transmission organization (RTO) without the explicit approval of
California=01,s Electricity Oversight Board, and to prohibit the divestitur=
e of
the investor-owned utilities=01, remaining generating assets until 2006. Th=
e
vehicle for pursuing authorization of state bond financing for acquisition =
of
transmission assets and construction of new generation facilities is still
being developed.

*California Public Utilities Commission. On January 18 the CPUC adopted a
decision prohibiting the sale of SCE=01,s Mohave Generating Station to AES.=
 This
voids a sale that was announced but not closed. The CPUC also delayed=20
decisions
regarding SCE=01,s application to end its rate freeze and the prudency crit=
eria
for utilities entering into long-term supply contracts.

Some of these issues will continue to evolve as they progress along their
respective and sometimes intersecting paths, and some will need to pass=20
through
multiple review bodies. This rapid and erratic evolution has not helped to
decrease either the financial risk associated with supplying energy to
California=01,s two largest utilities, or the level of uncertainty in devel=
oping
new generation to supply California in the future.

The ISO anticipates that it will call stage 3 emergencies (reserves less th=
an
1.5 percent) for January 19 and will most likely continue to curtail
interruptible customers through the weekend. Western energy supplies are be=
ing
strained by recent heavy usage of hydroelectric facilities where water=20
supplies
are already as much as 25 percent below average, owing to low precipitation=
=20
and
continued plant outages near 9,000 MW in California. The gravity of the
financial condition of California=01,s two largest utilities is exemplified=
 by=20
the
need for other, more creditworthy intermediaries, including California
municipal utilities, state agencies, and some unregulated energy suppliers,=
 to
act as temporary  guarantors for the acquisition of energy on behalf of PG&=
E
and SCE.

CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing
A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility 
authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state 
past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it 
postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- 
which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to 
the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
PG&E's utility is a "victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of 
predatory practices by natural gas suppliers," now demanding payment for 
future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its 
past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its 
credit-worthiness. 
The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of 
securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' 
bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive 
to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations 
while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be 
until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it 
will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend 
contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility 
spokesperson Staci Homrig. 
On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO 
because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline 
shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause 
the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports 
of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, 
they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or 
base gas at this point, Homrig said. 
Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in 
what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance 
payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. "These gas suppliers 
are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of 
flesh," Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. "Suppliers who 
have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 
'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the 
commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these 
agreements in order to keep the gas flowing." 
Part of the CPUC's action places a 90-day limit on the securitization option, 
so with the way gas contracts work, in effect, it only provides about another 
30 days' worth of supplies, said Homrig, who noted that almost all of PG&E's 
25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements (advances, 
cash-on-delivery or letters of credit) that the company cannot accommodate 
because of its cash-flow crisis.~ Out of ongoing negotiations, the parties 
came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables, 
thus, assuring them they will get paid. 
On the gas side, PG&E has had sufficient revenues --- unlike its electric 
business --- but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a 
normal payment arrangement because of the severe credit-rating decline in the 
past weeks. 
The CPUC met in San Francisco late Wednesday afternoon in the midst of a 
whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor, state legislature, 
consumer groups, regulators and utilities. A key piece was missing, however. 
California state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was 
to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy 
crisis. Reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of 
who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy 
business. A spokesman for the assembly speaker's office said he had no idea 
when the briefing would be re-scheduled. 
One piece of legislation that got through the state Senate (SB 1X) yesterday 
authorizes another $500 million in emergency funds to purchase power. It also 
would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities' 
wholesale power supplier under long-term contracts at least through 2002. The 
measure drew a protest from CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who argued that 
the state agency be "removed from that role as quickly as possible." The 
bill, which was first passed by the state Assembly, was returned to assembly 
committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate. It then would 
have to be ratified again by the Assembly. 
Meanwhile, consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the 
state bail-out of the private-sector utilities. This prompted at least one of 
the utilities, Southern California Edison, to come out swinging, saying that 
the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any 
"windfall profits" or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent 
company. 
A letter surfaced in Washington from Gov. Gray Davis to the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, dated Jan. 30 and outlining measures the state 
is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand, sign long-term 
contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state's public 
utilities. The letter, a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported 
here, contained no specifics on any long-term contracts nor legislation 
signed that would address the immediate problem. Davis outlined measures 
being taken to speed up siting of new power plants, saying an additional 
2,000 MW would be online by the end of the year. 
Responding to questions on another arena, Edison International's senior vice 
president Tom Higgins said "everything is on the table" in the ongoing 
negotiations between Davis' three-person negotiating team and the two 
utilities, including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in Los 
Angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities' own generation 
against the whopping wholesale power cost under-collections. 
The state remained under a power watch for the 16th day as the California 
independent grid operator (Cal-ISO) urged conservation because "reserves 
remain very low."

Title: California Rescinds Customer Choice; Effect on Distributed Energy Is Unclear

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2686;


***********************************************************************

EFFECTS ON DISTRIBUTED ENERGY ARE UNCLEAR

On September 20, 2001, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted 
to rescind electric retail choice, effective immediately. Although there are no 
pending decisions directly addressing distributed energy, many stakeholders 
fear that the door is now open to nonbypassable charges and exit fees that 
would render new self-generation projects uneconomic.

*   Amid higher rates, industrial customers examine self-generation options, 
but incentive program for projects under 1 megawatt is sending mixed signals. 

*   Southern California Edison's still-precarious financial situation is a 
threat to many existing small power producers in the state.

*   PG&E's bankruptcy recovery plan would provide 100 percent payment to 
generators.

*   Continued uncertainty is chilling the market for distributed energy.

At today's CPUC meeting the Commissioners once again did not act on the proposed decision to unbundle the SoCal system.  Without any comment, the GIR agenda item was Held Over to the next meeting as they have done the last 2 months.

On PG&E's application for approval of open season procedures (which PG&E filed to withdraw), Chairman Lynch stated that the proposed decisions (3 variations) were being Held Over not withdrawn.  I'll follow-up.

The next meeting is scheduled for Sept. 6th.  gh

Title: Taking up the Slack
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert

Cold weather in the Midwest and reduced storage
injections have taken up much of the temporary slack
that developed in the gas market during the warm
October. As expected, prices have responded quickly to
the cold, with the December futures contract price
advancing by over $0.75 per million British thermal
units (MMBtu) in the past week. As cold weather
develops, late winter supply availability is still
uncertain in CERA's view. For that reason, dual-fuel
markets must remain off of gas, and market fundamentals
support the recent price rebound, which places gas
prices again at a premium to resid.

CERA estimates that US working storage inventories as of
the end of October were approximately 2,746 billion
cubic feet (Bcf), an all-time low for that date by 64
Bcf (see table below). Storage injections of 36 Bcf for
the week ending November 3 were higher than a normal
weather pattern would indicate, but more normal weather
for the remainder of the month would result in
withdrawals averaging 3.5 Bcf per day during November.
This withdrawal rate is moderate by historical standards
but 2.5 Bcf per day higher than occurred in the past two
years (see table below). This pace of withdrawals places
inventories on a path toward an end-of-March minimum of
771 Bcf under normal winter weather conditions, only 13
Bcf above the previous all-time low.

This market remains tight. Although added supplies will
begin to help by the end of the winter, for now some
demand must still be priced out of the market in order
to preserve storage inventories.

Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC's expedited permitting process.  Lorna  

 

PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion 
PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company's ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. 
"We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season," said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group's West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. 
The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN's mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN's 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. 
GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. 
"The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest," King said. 
In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma. The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.  "There is clearly market interest in this project," King said. "We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready." 
The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d. The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line. The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line. The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission.

YPRPT,00.html 

High demand, perilously low storage inventories, and a supply response that 
is only beginning have driven gas prices in North America to stratospheric 
levels. The physical shortfall is now real enough, and prices have risen well 
above previous record highs to levels that should drive any demand that can 
realistically do so to leave the market. Gas is now pricing near the level of 
distillate for the first time ever, providing strong economic incentives to 
push to maximum levels of fuel switching.

El Paso Open Season Was 'Rigged,' CPUC Says

Armed with a "smoking gun" discovered in just-released data, the California 
Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has launched a fresh offensive against El 
Paso Natural Gas' 1.22 Bcf/d transportation contract arrangement with 
affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. 

Based on information uncovered in an internal e-mail, the CPUC now contends 
that the open season last February for one third of El Paso's firm 
transportation capacity was "rigged" to show preference to El Paso Merchant. 

The e-mail revealed that during the open season El Paso Merchant had 
"secretly negotiated" a two cents/MMBtu transportation discount rate on 
Mojave Pipeline, another El Paso affiliate, for service from Topock to 
Southern California Gas at Wheeler Ridge for quantities above 100,000 MMBtu/d 
effective March 1, 2000, the CPUC told FERC. The interruptible discount would 
last the entire 15 months of the new contracts offered in El Paso Natural 
Gas' open season, state regulators said, adding that Mojave had withheld 
announcing the discount until Feb. 18 --- after El Paso's open season had 
ended. 

The discounted capacity on Mojave was critical, given that FERC previously 
had ruled that about half of the 1.22 Bcf/d El Paso capacity (Block II 
capacity) could not directly access the SoCal-Topock delivery point. As a way 
around this restriction, bidders in the El Paso open season knew they could 
use El Paso capacity to access Mojave Pipeline at Topock, and then have their 
gas shipped to SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, the CPUC said. But what they didn't 
know was that Mojave had negotiated a discount with El Paso Merchant, the 
commission noted. The shippers were operating under the assumption that the 
IT rate still was four cents/MMBtu, which it had been for the previous 18 
months. 

The information about the discount was disclosed in a Feb. 9 e-mail written 
by El Paso Merchant Vice President Robin Cox, which acknowledged that "Mojave 
is willing to offer" a two cent/MMBtu discount rate for volumes above 100,000 
MMBtu/d. "I will not officially request this discount until next Wednesday 
assuming we win the capacity," the executive wrote. "After it is posted, it 
will be [available] to everyone." 

This e-mail makes "clear that El Paso Merchant received preferential 
treatment from El Paso/Mojave and had unfair advantages over all other 
bidders during the open season" in violation of Sections 4 and 5 of the 
Natural Gas Act, the CPUC charged. It urged FERC to "fulfill its duty and 
abrogate" the El Paso-El Paso Merchant contract arrangement.

El Paso Closer to Acquiring PG&E's Texas Assets

El Paso Energy Corp. is closer to acquiring PG&E Corp.'s Texas gathering and 
liquids businesses for about $840 million in stock and debt after signing a 
consent agreement earlier this week. The deal includes 8,500 miles of natural 
gas transmission pipelines that transport about 2.8 Bcf/d, nine processing 
plants that process 1.5 Bcf/d, and a 7.2 Bcf natural gas storage field. 

PG&E National Energy Group bought the properties about three years ago from 
Valero Energy and Teco for $1.02 billion, but had been unable to turn a 
profit. When it purchased the properties, PG&E paid a premium price to enter 
the west-east gas transportation market. However, since the sale, the basis 
between Waha in West Texas and Katy and the Houston Ship Channel has 
tightened and PG&E could not overcome the roadblocks to become a major 
player. 

The assets, which also include significant natural gas liquids pipelines and 
fractionation facilities, serve all of Texas' major metropolitan areas, large 
industrial load centers and several natural gas trading hubs. The book value 
before the sale to El Paso was estimated to be between $2.5 billion and $2.7 
billion. 

Before buying PG&E's assets, El Paso was already an experienced player in the 
liquids game. When the deal was first announced, El Paso said that 70% of the 
cash flow generated by the Texas assets came from stable fee-based activities 
with the balance from processing. El Paso, which is close to completing a 
merger with The Coastal Corp., expects to actively manage the risk on the 
non-fee-based side. 

As part of the normal review process, the consent agreement signed this week 
is subject to the approval of the Federal Trade Commission. El Paso also has 
to finalize a similar agreement with the State of Texas. Once the agreements 
are approved, El Paso Energy expects to close the transaction in the fourth 
quarter.

Enron Q4 profit rises 32 percent
Strong business mix pushes energy firm past estimates 

MONDAY, JANUARY 22, 2001 11:19:00 AM EST 
By Andrew Kelly
HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Enron Corp., North America's biggest buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, on Monday reported a sharp rise in 
fourth-quarter operating earnings, surpassing expectations, as online trading 
drove strong growth at its core wholesale energy operations.
Enron said it took a net non-recurring after-tax charge of $287 million in 
the fourth quarter related to its troubled water affiliate Azurix Corp. AZX 
</quotes/quotes.asp?symb=AZX&source=>. Enron announced plans last year to 
finance a buyout that would take Azurix private.
Earnings before non-recurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 million, or 41 
cents a share, from $259 million or 31 cents a share a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts had expected earnings of 35 cents a share, according to 
First Call/Thomson Financial.
In early Monday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron's shares were 
up $3-1/8, or 4.41 percent, at $74.
Fourth-quarter net income including the Azurix charge was $60 million, or 5 
cents per share.
The company's fourth-quarter revenues rose 271 percent from a year earlier, 
to $40.8 billion.
"The impressive thing is the overall growth that they experienced," said 
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. "I think it had been in most people's 
forecasts that they would have to do something to clean up Azurix."
ANALYST MAINTAINS BUY RATING
Eassey said he was retaining a "buy" rating on Enron's stock and considered 
the company one of his top picks.
"I think that they will sustain a higher growth rate on average for the next 
several years going forward, as they have for the past 10 years, because of 
their innovation and their way of attacking the markets," he said.
Analysts pointed to the strong volume growth in Enron's core energy business 
and played down the significance of the charge for Azurix.
Enron, which has branched out beyond energy into fields such as broadband 
telecommunications and metals trading, saw its stock rise 87 percent in 2000, 
outpacing a 54 percent gain for the Standard & Poor's utilities index  
</quotes/quotes.asp?symb=&source=>.
Electricity and natural gas stocks were boosted by safe-haven buying in 2000 
as investors lost faith in other sectors.
So far this year, Enron's stock is down 12 percent, broadly in line with the 
S&P utilities index, which has fallen as investors have cashed in some of 
last year's gains. Concern about possible fallout from California's power 
crisis has also hurt the index.
Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling said in a 
conference call that the company's fourth-quarter earnings were not 
significantly impacted by the power crisis in California, where rolling 
electricity blackouts were imposed last week and the state's top two 
utilities are close to bankruptcy as they face soaring wholesale electricity 
costs.
"We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on 
Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets," he 
added.
Meanwhile, Enron said its physical wholesale gas and power deliveries rose 90 
percent in the fourth quarter from year-earlier levels, with strong growth 
both in North America and Europe.
EnronOnline, the company's Web-based trading system, completed its first full 
year of operation in 2000, executing 548,000 transactions with a gross value 
of $336 billion.
Besides gas and power, Enron uses the online system to make markets in 
commodities such as pulp and paper, petrochemicals, metals and broadband 
capacity, also known as bandwidth.
ORIGINS AS PIPELINE COMPANY
Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron has pursued opportunities 
created by deregulation to become North America's biggest wholesale gas and 
electricity marketer. It is building a similar business in Europe, where 
energy markets are also gradually opening up to competition.
Enron regards its knowledge of volatile energy and commodity markets as its 
key strength, allowing it to profit from price swings while saving money for 
its customers and managing their exposure to potentially costly movements in 
prices.
Fourth-quarter earnings before interest and taxes at Enron's wholesale energy 
business almost tripled from a year earlier, to $777 million.
Enron Energy Services, which helps business customers reduce their energy 
costs, posted earnings before interest and taxes of $33 million, up from $7 
million in the fourth quarter of 1999.
On Friday Enron Energy Services said it had signed an energy management 
agreement with Owens-Illinois Inc. OI </quotes/quotes.asp?symb=OI&source=> 
worth $2 billion over 10 years, its biggest deal to date.
Enron said its broadband telecommunications business, which was launched last 
year and is still in the start-up phase, posted a loss of $32 million on 
revenues of $63 million for the fourth quarter. Enron has said it will take a 
few years for the business to become profitable.
The company sells bandwidth on its own fiber optic network and is also 
pioneering the development of standardized tradable bandwidth contracts.

*UtiliCorp Wants To Spin Off Aquila
Kansas City Business Journal =01) 09/29/2000
By Brian Cookson

UtiliCorp United Inc. wants to parlay the rapid growth of its Aquila Energy=
=20
subsidiary into a piece of a new, larger Aquila.

The Kansas City-based utility has plans to spin off Aquila, possibly=20
retaining ownership of a third of it, selling another third to a partner an=
d=20
offering the remainder in the stock market.  The move could allow Aquila, n=
ow=20
engaged primarily in trading power and natural gas, to gain more hard asset=
s=20
of its own and seek higher valuation from investors.

=01&We really think the value of our company is much higher than the market=
=20
currently values it because it values it as a utility,=018 Aquila spokesman=
 Al=20
Butkus said.

Aquila, which moved its headquarters to Kansas City last year, has been the=
=20
engine behind earnings growth for UtiliCorp.  For the second quarter of thi=
s=20
year, Aquila reported earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) of $49.5=20
million, up 113 percent from the previous year.  UtiliCorp as a whole had=
=20
EBIT of $103.9 million for the second quarter of 2000.

Aquila may be able to attract more interest because it wouldn=01,t carry th=
e=20
image of a traditional utility, Butkus said.

Richard Stuebi, president of Next Wave Energy, agreed.  The head of the=20
Denver-based electricity consulting firm said Wall Street historically has=
=20
undervalued conglomerates such as UtiliCorp.

=01&In general, the stock market prefers companies that are clean or pure=
=20
plays,=018 Stuebi said.

Aquila=01,s strategy comes as little surprise to Stuebi.  As much success a=
s the=20
company has had, he said he thought Aquila would need to get bigger to=20
compete.

=01&In most aspects of the energy business, the race for scale is on,=018 h=
e said.

Aquila also could increase its value to shareholders by looking for hard=20
assets to match its marketing prowess.  Aquila CEO Keith Stamm said the=20
company could address this need by building, such as the new electric=20
generation plant it is building in Pleasant Hill.  It also could buy=20
generation capacity or take on a partner with electric generation capacity.

Stamm said the company is looking for such a partner but is keeping the oth=
er=20
two options open.  Finding a partner with power plants could become easier =
as=20
energy deregulation causes many utilities to look at separating generating=
=20
operations from power sales and distribution.

Stamm said that Aquila has talked to several companies and that an=20
announcement could come by the end of the year.

The timing of any initial public stock offering would be dependent on the=
=20
results of the search for a partner.

Butkus said UtiliCorp isn=01,t sacrificing its hold on Aquila.  Instead,=20
executives are hoping to own part of an infinitely more valuable company.

Aquila already is moving to enter a new market =01) trading bandwidth, or=
=20
capacity on communications networks.  Stamm said the bandwidth market is=20
potentially several times larger than the energy market because=20
communications networks can be linked by satellite to anywhere in the world=
. =20
Gas pipelines require a physical connection.

Traders in the bandwidth market could include telecom companies or Internet=
=20
providers that either have network capacity to sell or that need to boost=
=20
their capacity.

=01&We like to see volatility, and we=01,re seeing it,=018 Stamm said.

Aquila is adding a crew of 35 to 40 people to begin trading bandwidth by th=
e=20
end of the year.  It won=01,t be alone, however, as companies such as Houst=
on=01,s=20
Enron Corp. also are getting into bandwidth trading.

Effective today, Northern Border is lifting a firm-only restriction on its 42-inch Monchy/Port of Morgan to Ventura segment. The constraint had been implemented Wednesday due to compressor station outages upstream of Ventura.
El Paso Field Services has scheduled its annual maintenance shutdown of the Waha Plant for Oct. 7-12. Fourteen gathering systems will be shut in. 
Capacity of the San Juan Crossover will remain restricted to 570 MMcf/d until repairs are completed on an air leak in the Lincoln Station's turbine, El Paso said.

FERC Approves Questar Pipeline

     The FERC has given final approval for a Questar $155 million
pipeline project to transport natural gas to southern California from
the Four Corners area at the borders of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and
Colorado. The ruling came after the commission was satisfied the
Questar Southern Trails Pipeline project would not harm the
environment. The project will consist of 693 miles of crude oil
pipeline that was bought by Questar in 1998 from Arco. The pipeline
will be converted for natural gas and several new compressors will be
built. The pipeline would be divided into a East Zone and a West
Zone. The East Zone will begin in the San Juan Basin in New Mexico
and end at the California border and carry up to 88 MMcf per day. The
West Zone is within California and has a capacity of 120 MMcf per
day.

Title: The Storm Arrives
Author: N. American Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,

*********************************************************

Cold Weather Path
Colder-than-normal weather through November and
forecasted cold for the first half of December
throughout the Midwest and Northeast have driven gas
prices well into record territory, with the January
Henry Hub price trading near $9.00 per MMBtu and closing
above $8.00 on the New York Mercantile Exchange December
6. This six-week cold period and the quick depletion of
already low storage inventories has established prices
at or above CERA's cold weather path for the remainder
of the winter and in all likelihood beyond. If December
storage withdrawals are as high as CERA now expects, the
gas market will remain on the cold weather path through
2001 as well, even if weather returns to normal during
the second half of December. The enormous increase in
storage injections that is likely to be required next
summer would keep the pressure on gas markets throughout
the year.

So long as weather remains cold (or even normal) this
winter, a new market dynamic is in effect in which gas
prices interact more with distillate fuel oil prices
rather than with those of residual fuel oil. In
addition, gas is likely to have an increasingly direct
influence on power prices in the growing number of
regions in which gas-fired generation is now on the
margin in winter. This winter, the gas market is likely
to rediscover for the first time in decades which end
users value natural gas most highly, and which
ultimately do not.

The gas market is also rediscovering the value of firm
pipeline capacity, particularly into market areas. Both
the West Coast and the Northeast have experienced even
more extreme price spikes, with daily prices in both
regions peaking above $20.00 per MMBtu. Indeed, the
shortage of gas in California is so acute that prices
above $40.00 per MMBtu have been reported. If sustained,
these price levels will induce a political reaction that
will reverberate throughout the industry.

Storage Update-Even High Seems Low
Panic in the market yesterday was eased somewhat as
storage withdrawals for the week ending December 1, at
73 billion cubic feet (Bcf), proved to be less than
expected. This withdrawal was half the previous week's
rate, and in CERA's view actual withdrawals for both
weeks probably lie between these two readings. (In some
cases successive weeks smooth out volatile readings in
the AGA survey.) But even the 73 Bcf figure, though a
significant retreat from the previous week's rate, is
high by historical standards. One would have to go back
to 1994 to find a higher reading for a comparable week
in the AGA survey.

Inventories as of the beginning of December, at an
estimated 2,466 Bcf (see Table 1), were 525 Bcf below
the year-earlier level, and this deficit is likely to
increase substantially during December. If weather
forecasts indicating colder-than-normal weather through
mid-December in key heating markets hold true, storage
withdrawals for the month will average approximately
20.0 Bcf per day. This rate is an increase from CERA's
normal weather estimate of 17.0 Bcf per day, and even
this rate depends on weather returning to normal in mid-
December. This level of withdrawals would leave only
1,846 Bcf in storage on January 1, an inventory 663 Bcf
below the year-earlier level. Assuming normal weather,
such an inventory would place storage on track to reach
a March minimum of 488 Bcf, 270 Bcf below the 1996
record low. At a US inventory level this low, many
storage operators would be dipping into base-load gas in
order to support service even to firm gas customers.

* Physical deliverability from storage fields will be
significantly lower this year in midwinter, forcing a
greater reliance on pipeline gas and peaking facilities
during January and February. The actual reduction in
field deliverability is impossible to quantify, but
storage inventories cannot be withdrawn at steady rates
throughout the winter; withdrawal rates decline with
inventory as field pressure is reduced.

*  Pressure in the market will be reinforced and
extended through 2001 and probably into 2002. During the
past two summers, high prices have been required to
discourage demand and allow overall US storage
injections to reach barely 1.6 trillion cubic feet
(Tcf). If normal weather holds for the remainder of this
winter, 2.2 Tcf of injections-which would be nearly
impossible to achieve-would be required during 2001 if
inventories are to recover to 2.7 Tcf at peak. If
weather this winter is merely normal from mid-December
through March, going into winter next year the United
States will have considerably less gas in storage.
Reaching even the 2,362 Bcf level, according to CERA
estimates (see Table 1), would require an additional 275
Bcf of injections next year, and that alone would prove
challenging.

Price-The Cold Weather Path
The weakness of storage inventories and the demand
pressure in both core and power generation markets
created by the cold weather have caused prices to move
onto and even above CERA's cold weather path for this
winter (see Table 2). Storage inventories would become
perilously low if the current forecast for cold weather
through mid-December proves accurate, and the injections
required next summer would keep pressure in the market
intense. For these reasons CERA's outlook for prices for
January and throughout 2001 now reflects the cold
weather path.  Prices could take an even higher path,
particularly if colder-than-normal weather endures
beyond mid-December or returns on a sustained basis in
January or February.

Several forces that could weaken prices during 2001 will
begin to enter the market during the winter, but these
are offset by demand volatility in the winter and the
requirement to rebuild storage inventories once the
winter is over. Such factors include a building US
supply capability, growing imports, softening oil prices
(allowing a lower floor for prices once the winter
ends), and potentially weakening economic growth.

Although the influence of these factors will increase,
it is unlikely to match the huge injection requirement
that appears more and more certain next summer.

Demand-The Difficult Next Round of Switching
With gas prices hitting new record highs, CERA expects
some additional demand to be priced out of the market.
Because gas has priced above residual fuel oil for most
weeks since May, however, the easiest fuel switching in
the power generation and industrial sectors has already
occurred. Even though gas prices are currently above the
level of distillate (approximately $7.23 per MMBtu in
New York), switching from gas to distillate requires
changes in long-standing consumer habit, will occur only
over time, and is likely limited in volume. Significant
switching to distillate would quickly raise the price of
distillate itself.

There are four major sources of additional demand
response in industrial markets:

* Additional switching to resid in industrial boilers.
The next increment of demand to come out of the market
is likely to be in the industrial sector, through
additional fuel switching to resid (and to some extent
to distillate). These markets will continue to show some
flexibility but will not represent a large volume. CERA
estimates that the industrial boiler market has probably
already begun to lose small amounts (less than 0.5 Bcf
per day) in switching to resid, given the consistency of
gas price premiums greater than $0.50 per MMBtu.

* Investment in restoring switching capability. As
premiums move far beyond this level, industrial end
users can be expected to take a closer look at
reinvigorating their switching capability beyond their
initial short-term levels. However, such a change would
require investment by industrial end users and the
availability of resid in oil markets. CERA estimates
that with focused investment over the course of a number
of months to perhaps a year, switching to resid could
eventually reach as high as 1.3 Bcf per day. There is
already some movement here; given the impact of high gas
prices on earnings, energy prices have already begun to
receive management attention.

* Switching to distillate. US Department of Energy data
suggest that industrial end users have a theoretical
capability of switching nearly 1.3 Bcf per day to
distillate in the short term. This switch would
represent additional distillate demand of over 200,000
barrels per day (bd) in a US market of 3.8 million
barrels. This marginal demand would move the distillate
price in tandem with gas price, and any additional
switching among power generators to distillate would
reinforce this price correlation. In addition, the
availability of distillate inventories on site should
restrict the quick switching to short periods of time
and will not offer a long-term solution to tight
markets.

* Shutting down industrial plants. Also offering some
flexibility is the shutdown of manufacturing plants that
use gas as a feedstock. The major feedstock consumers
are the ammonia and methanol industries, and, not
surprisingly given the tight margins available,
manufacturers of ammonia and of methanol continue to
show suppressed gas demand. However, in the short term
only a portion of ammonia production is at risk. Whereas
the production needs of merchant facilities along the
Gulf Coast is relatively readily replaced by imports,
substitution becomes more difficult away from the coast
(because of transportation logistics) and for facilities
whose production is linked to value-added fertilizer
products. Hence, CERA still estimates that even with
nonexistent margins, substantial ammonia production
would continue, with additional losses of perhaps 200
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day of potential demand in
addition to the facilities that have already closed.
Extraordinarily high gas prices will also hasten the
shuttering of North American methanol capacity, putting
at risk another 100 to 200 MMcf per day of gas demand
for that sector.

Switching that could occur in boiler use is concentrated
in the chemicals, paper, and refining sectors in the
South and the food products sector in the Midwest.
Continuing feedstock losses would be concentrated in the
South Central region. For process users, even
extraordinarily high gas prices are expected to have
little impact on the use of gas in the short term.
Energy costs are not the dominant component of
production costs for these users, and a physical
changeover would be time-intensive and elemental in its
impact on end-use product quality.

The Northeast-Cold Weather Operations Begin
All of the Northeast pipelines have issued notices to
customers that they either have imposed, or are highly
likely to need to impose, transportation restrictions of
various types. The most common restriction is to
nonprimary firm services (secondary and interruptible
type services), which will be scheduled for the next
several days on many pipelines. Other pipelines have
issued balancing requirements whereby receipts and
deliveries must match. Even hourly flow orders have also
been implemented.

These actions are normal for winter operations when a
cold period is expected. Whereas the firm market for
natural gas is rarely affected by these restrictions,
the spot market becomes much more volatile as
interruptible supplies dry up. The spot market,
primarily made up of nonfirm customers, has had a
dramatic reaction to the diminished availability of
delivered spot gas into the market area, as has been
reflected by the volatility of the cash market this
week. The result of these restrictions of nonprimary
firm services has been an expansion of basis to Henry
Hub. At one point, gas for next-day delivery to New York
traded near $24.00 per MMBtu delivered, although the
average price was closer to $14.20. These high spikes
are the result of very thinly traded volumes of gas.

Although these restrictions will likely ease as
temperatures return closer to normal, CERA now expects
basis into the New York citygate to average $1.31 per
MMBtu for December and $1.36 per MMBtu for January.

CA Reviews State Power Auction Results
California's closely watched entry into the long-term, bulk power market 
turned up 39 bidders at an average 6.9 cents/kWh price, the governor's office 
reported late Wednesday, as the state government finished its whirlwind 
27-hour, sealed-bid power auction. 
Gov. Gray Davis said the state received a "very representative bid with a 
good deal of power bid for, and it was a very good sample, certainly one that 
gives us all optimism." 
Tom Hannigan, director of the state water resource department who oversaw the 
auction, said the state obtained "a useful sample across all times of the day 
across the spectrum of the year, and we are quite pleased with the initial 
results. I look forward to looking through bids and developing some long-term 
contracts. Our fundamental responsibility here is to purchase power at the 
best possible prices for consumers and businesses." 
On Wednesday as the bids from the Internet-based auction were initially 
accessed, Davis said he expected a new law from the state legislature by Feb. 
1, giving the state authority to consummate deals involving the best of the 
bids received in the quick-turnaround auction. 
The bids covered six-month, three-, five- and 10-year durations. Hearings in 
Sacramento continued on the omnibus new law(s) that would give the state 
long-term buying authority, and also decide how to handle operation of the 
utility hydroelectric generation system and over-market purchased power 
contracts with so-called "qualifying facilities" (QFs). 
Bidders, utilities and other market participants expressed initial enthusiasm 
for the state's new program, with San Diego-based Sempra's CEO telling the 
financial community Thursday that he is "encouraged" by the state auction. 
"We don't yet have detailed information on the bids in the first round --- 
and in my opinion that's what it is, a first round --- but from what the 
governor has said, I am quite encouraged that we are going to see power 
allocated to the three utilities at below the costs that they have recently 
been paying in the wholesale power market," said Sempra's Stephen Baum. "That 
should ease the financial situation of all three utilities and give us 
greater liquidity, opening the way to further measures being discussed, such 
as securitization of uncollected balances." 
California's governor also pushed ahead on several other fronts, announcing 
three new energy-related advisors plucked from the public and private 
sectors: Mike Peevey, a former utility president turned-successful-energy 
startup entrepreneur; S. David Freeman, general manager of the nation's 
largest municipal utility and a veteran of more than four decades in public 
power; and Frank Zarb, NASDAQ Stock Market CEO and a former top-level energy 
adviser in Presidents Nixon and Ford administrations in Washington, D.C. in 
the 1970s. 
Peevey, whose wife was elected to the state legislature in November, will 
serve as Davis's energy adviser; Freeman will help the state water resources 
department develop long-term power contracts and Zarb will advise Davis on 
energy finance and market issues. 
Also on Wednesday, Davis announced the newly created five-member politically 
appointed board for the state-chartered transmission grid operator (Cal-ISO) 
held its first meeting. It replaces a 26-member industry stakeholder board 
that Davis has regularly criticized for representing energy companies rather 
than consumers. The new members include close aides to the governor, such as 
his business/transportation cabinet-level secretary, head of the state 
Electricity Oversight Board, and his senior policy adviser, along with a 
veteran consumer group attorney and the chief staff person at the Silicon 
Valley Manufacturing Group. 
A California-based spokesperson for Duke, Tom Williams, confirmed that his 
company participated in the auction and that its bids are "all contingent on 
coming to agreeable credit terms." Reliant also reportedly participated in 
the auction. 
"The balls in the state's court now," Williams said. In addition to 
announcing it had made "credible bids" in the state water resources 
department-run electricity auction, Duke noted that pre-scheduled outages of 
two power plant units to upgrade their air emission controls --- one each at 
Moss Landing and San Diego's South Bay --- were nearing completion and would 
be back the end of January (Moss) and March respectively.

Note:  This interview with Jack Crawford of Alliance is probably the best 
information we have gained on the pipeline
operational start up and background information.  Vector may still be "iffy" 
for Dec. 1.  

Fingers Crossed, Alliance, Vector Shoot for Dec. 1
 
Alliance Pipeline informed its shippers yesterday that all debris has been 
cleared from the pipe, all connections are up and running, and that 
commercial service will begin on Dec. 1. Commercial service originally was 
expected to begin on Oct. 1 but was delayed several times because of 
commissioning problems . 

"We've tested all of our connections and we've been flowing volumes [to 
Midwestern LDCs] up to about half [663 MMcf/d] of what the pipeline is 
capable of transporting," said Alliance spokesman Jack Crawford. 

"We are asking our shippers today to provide forecasts to us of what they 
expect to do in the first month. The last time we did this the forecasts we 
got suggested that we'd be running at about 1.325 Bcf on the first day." 

One of the key questions remaining is whether Alliance's main downstream 
supply outlet, the 270-mile Vector Pipeline project, will be ready to go as 
well on Dec. 1. Vector had construction problems because of wet weather and 
also was forced to delay its start-up from Nov. 1.  The pipeline would 
transport 700 MMcf/d of gas initially from Joliet, IL, through Indiana and 
Michigan to Dawn, ON, but would be expanded to 1 Bcf/d next November. 

"The last I heard they were expecting to make [the deadline]," said Crawford. 
"We actually tested our meter with them over the weekend and it's all up and 
running, but that might be a subsequent event if they have a problem. It's 
been a challenge for them to get going, but it looks like they are all ready 
to go." 

A Vector spokesman confirmed that commissioning is going smoothly and 
operations appear to be on schedule for Dec. 1 start-up. "Right now everybody 
still feels that Dec. 1 is doable," he said. "You might want to touch base 
again next week and see how it looks, but right now it looks like we're 
getting things pretty well wrapped up. 

"The last place where we've been completing work has been up in the Milford 
and Highland Townships in Oakland County, MI. That's the area just before we 
go in the portion of the pipeline that we're leasing from Michigan 
Consolidated Gas Co. As of last Friday, they still hadn't reached that area 
with linepack [gas]." 

Crawford said the Aux Sable liquids plant also is up and running, and 
previous pipeline coordination difficulties have been ironed out. "They are 
still bringing it up to full scale. They are short both volume and heat 
content at the moment and that's by design. The pipeline is flowing at about 
half volume at the moment, and in addition to that we've been running lean 
test gas." 

Farther upstream, Alliance still has one lateral, the Peace River Lateral, 
that will be delayed because of the impact of wet summer weather on 
construction. "It will be up and running perhaps not by Dec. 1 but in a week 
or two. It's an eight and 10-inch line. It's relatively small," he said. 

Once the massive new pipeline is running smoothly, the next steps to be taken 
include potential connections with several proposed pipelines in and around 
Chicago, including potentially the Guardian, Horizon and Whitecap Energy 
projects. 

"We also looked at a couple of other receipt connections on the upstream 
side," said Crawford. "We've obviously talked about a potential expansion in 
the future, but as we found out by talking to people it looks like the supply 
additions in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin have not been as brisk as 
we might have thought, probably because of the downturn in the oil price a 
couple of years ago. It's likely that an expansion would be delayed for a 
year or two or even three. 

"The best that I've been able to ascertain from talking to people is that our 
supply deliverability really has not increased very much in the last two to 
three years, and as a consequence at least in the short run the gas on our 
system will end up coming out of other systems." 

He also mentioned that TransCanada is planning to take some of its capacity 
out of service, including retiring some older compressors and rewheeling 
others, in order to reduce the amount of excess pipeline capacity in the 
Canadian gas market.

El Paso Puts Off Maintenance to Meet CA Demand

El Paso Natural Gas has decided to postpone what it called "routine" 
maintenance projects on its system in order to maintain the flow of natural 
gas into the California market to meet the surge in demand there. The higher 
demand has been created by a shortfall in energy imports from the Northwest 
region, which has been gripped by cold weather. 

The pipeline deferred indefinitely two maintenance projects on the South 
Mainline --- at Wenden Station in Arizona and the Wenden A turbine --- that 
were scheduled to take place today and Friday. It also deferred indefinitely 
work on the North Mainline at Hackberry 2 turbine in Arizona, which was to 
have occurred Dec. 10-17. 

If El Paso had gone forward with the maintenance projects, the company said 
throughput would have been cut by about 150 MMcf/d on its South Mainline, by 
50-75 MMcf/d on the Havasu Crossover, and by 80 MMcf/d on its North Mainline. 

The maintenance work at the Wenden Station, which is located on the south end 
of the Havasu Crossing, involved replacing batteries. "It has been agreed to 
by our operations people that those batteries are still in decent enough 
shape, [so] it's not a concern to continue running like this. And with the 
throughput situation and high gas prices [in California], it's in everybody's 
best interest that we not do this maintenance at this time," said Charlie 
Mathis, an administrator for pipeline control at El Paso. 

He estimated the El Paso system presently is running at 85-90% of the 
throughput level it had prior to the explosion near Carlsbad, NM, last 
August. That blast reduced the pipeline's operating capacity by 200 MMcf/d. 

Mathis said about 1.2 Bcf/d presently is being delivered into California over 
El Paso's South Mainline, and 1.5-1.7 Bcf/d is being delivered at Topock, AZ, 
over its North Mainline. 

In addition to the deferred maintenance projects, El Paso took a Waha GE 
turbine off line last Sunday to investigate a vibration problem. That has 
reduced capacity on the South Mainline by about 50 MMcf/d, said Mathis. He 
noted the turbine is scheduled to be back in service Friday. 

To offset the impact of the turbine outage on the market, El Paso decided to 
put off until this weekend work it had planned to do on Line 1100 between the 
Pecos River and the Guadalupe Stations --- a line that was affected by the 
explosion last August. The line will be taken out of service Dec. 8 and 
returned to service on Dec. 9, reducing the capacity of the South Mainline by 
50 MMcf/d each day. 

In the near term, El Paso is scheduled to run a smart pig through Line 3222 
on its North Mainline on Dec. 12, which will reduce capacity out of the San 
Juan Basin by about 50-100 MMcf/d, Mathis said. Pigging also is planned for 
Line 3201, which will cut capacity by about 150 MMcf/d. The reductions will 
affect points upstream of the Bondad Mainline and Gallup.

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift in the Wind
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2271


WEATHER CALMS THE MARKET, BUT TROUBLESOME SUPPLY MEANS PRICES STILL MUST
DISCOURAGE DEMAND
The focus in the gas market has shifted markedly from the crisis this winter,
and how high prices might rise, to the spring shoulder months and how low
prices might fall. Wellhead supply remains troublesome, however, and prices
must remain above those of alternative fuels, keeping most flexible end users
out of the gas market.

* For the remainder of February and March the gas market is not yet out of the
woods; prices could still rebound quickly with cold weather.

* Storage inventories, though still well into record low territory, are higher
than was expected and feared earlier this winter, and the prospect of 
inventory
levels that would test overall system reliability and cause widespread
curtailments of firm services appears less and less likely.

* For March, occasional weather-driven price spikes may still occur, but in 
the
context of prices settling toward a level just adequate to keep a necessary
amount of demand out of the gas market. This pattern should result in an
average price of $6.50 per MMBtu at the Henry Hub.

Alliance Deliveries Delayed until Nov. 13

In a move that is likely to send ripples through the market, particularly 
around Chicago, the 1.325 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline extended its commercial 
in-service delay last week to Nov. 13 from Oct. 30. Pipeline officials said 
moisture and debris in the line caused the delay. 

"As we have increased the flow of test gas volumes during our system 
commissioning, we have encountered moisture and debris from construction," 
said CEO Norm Gish. "Specifically, most of the debris is in the form of small 
pieces of foam from the [smart] pigs that were used to remove the hydrostatic 
testing water from the line. The problem forced us to shut down the system 
for short periods of time to clean out accumulated debris. 

"We have since designed and installed additional in-line screens at our 
compressor stations. The situation is improving and we are removing 
ever-decreasing amounts of debris with increased flows of test gas. However, 
this situation has not permitted us to run our system with the significant 
volumes necessary to adequately test the reliability of our compressors." 

It is the second time Alliance has had to delay its in-service date. In early 
September, Alliance officials said rain in Saskatchewan this summer, 
directional drilling problems at a creek in British Columbia, complex 
connection problems with the Aux Sable liquids plant in Illinois and 
connection delays with several U.S. pipelines and LDCs was to blame for a 
one-month delay to Oct. 30 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 11). 

The pipeline will continue increasing test volumes until it begins commercial 
service, said Gish. There currently is about 500 MMcf/d of test gas in the 
line. He expects firm delivery capacity to reach the full 1.325 Bcf/d prior 
to Nov. 13. 

Alliance officials also noted that this is the first time a pipeline the size 
of Alliance has been brought on stream at one time. 

Regardless of the challenge, however, market participants were expecting the 
system to be delivering gas starting at the beginning of the month of 
November and this delay is likely to have a significant impact on November 
bidweek trading. 

One Chicago trader said he had a strong suspicion something was fishy when 
his index offers were lifted Friday afternoon by a marketing company, which 
he knows to own capacity on the pipe. "Everyone was a buyer of index gas 
today for November, especially those now short for the first 13 days. I sold 
mine at NGI plus 1.5, but had I known that Alliance was delayed I would have 
held out for something a little better." 

Basis, meanwhile, was pretty much unchanged at +13 to +14 for November. "It 
takes a lot to move the Chicago basis," he said.

EIA Predicts Supply Shortfall Will Linger Through Winter

The Energy Information Administration said yesterday in its September 
Short-Term Energy Outlook it is projecting natural gas prices at the wellhead 
will increase by about 87% this winter (October-March) compared to last 
winter. Residential prices for gas are expected to rise on average by 27% 
compared to last year. For the entire year, the average wellhead price for 
natural gas is projected to be $3.40/Mcf, the highest annual wellhead price 
on record (in inflation-adjusted terms, it would be the highest annual 
average price since 1985). 

The short-term supply constraints that are currently hindering the industry's 
ability to meet storage and power generation demand at the same time are 
likely to continue into the heating season, EIA said. Storage levels could 
end up being about 8% below the five-year average of about 3,000 Bcf by the 
start of winter if net injections continue at 10% below historically average 
rates through the remainder of the refill season. 

The effects of increased drilling for gas are not expected to appear in the 
form of significantly increased production until after the next heating 
season, according to the agency's report. 

"For now, we are continuing to maintain a conservative view of possible 
increases in domestic gas production for 2000 and 2001, with assumed 
increases of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, for this year and next...," the EIA 
report stated. "On the other hand, the U.S. natural gas rig count on Aug. 25 
was at a recent high of 794 rigs. Exploration and production budgets for many 
natural gas producers are expected to increase sharply in 2000 and 2001, 
spurred by higher prices and greatly improved current and expected revenues 
from producing assets. Also on the positive side, data from the Texas 
Railroad Commission suggest that, through May, year 2000 gas production 
increased, if only slightly (0.4%). This signifies a turnaround (however 
modest) in a key producing region. Very high gas drilling rates, including a 
record-setting pace in deep offshore Gulf of Mexico, confirm that 
increasingly positive results for domestic gas production are under way." 

Imports are projected to rise by about 12% next year primarily because of the 
1.35 Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline coming on line next month. 

Meanwhile the demand outlook remains bullish at 4.2% annual growth. In 2001, 
however, the forecast has been revised downward to 2.5% growth because of 
higher than expected natural gas prices. The industrial sector is the leading 
sector for demand increases in 2000 at 9.3%, while electric utility demand is 
expected to decline by 4.0% primarily because of power plant sales. For the 
power generation sector as a whole, gas demand is expected to grow 6.5% this 
year and 1.5% in 2001. EIA said the reduced growth rate next year is largely 
due to the reversal in relative prices of fuel oil and natural gas, which 
began in August, with fuel oil gaining the price advantage as gas prices 
continued to rise. 

Gas demand this winter is expected to be up by 5.7% compared to last winter 
if weather is normal. Normal weather implies a 12% rise in heating 
degree-days compared with last winter.

Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes

Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run 
around FERC's Order 637,
filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff 
procedures to avoid the
more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer 
protests. 

Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories, 
Indicated Shippers said. They include
imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality, 
point allocations, curtailment 
priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental 
purchase and sale, capacity release,
unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous. 

Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of 
KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316), 
saying "most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI 
to implement elements of 
Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity 
for meaningful review and 
comment by KMI's customers." Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and 
comment on usually routine 
tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted 
30 days for comments on 
Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to 
make compliance filings June 15. 

KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed 
at changing its tariff to reflect "the 
current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.." It 
did acknowledge, "A number of the 
changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's 
goals in Order No. 637." 

Indicated Shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding 
negative storage imbalances 
and end of season inventory swaps a matter of KMI's discretion without any 
standards on how those decisions 
would be made. The shippers also protested changes to the default methodology 
for point allocations for billing 
purposes, and the injection of KMI discretion into the formula for accepting 
or rejecting predetermined allocation 
agreements with upstream or downstream parties. In addition curtailment 
provisions filed by KMI appear to be 
contrary to Order 637-A's mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary 
path should have primary rights. 

The filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up 
significant quantities of coal bed methane gas 
in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on 
nitrogen content, according to 
Western Gas Resources. A key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality 
specification of 3% by volume. 
While KMI states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with 
interconnecting pipelines, six of the 
seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications. Only 
KMI's affiliate, Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America, has similar rules, Western Gas said. 

"KMI's proposed nitrogen specification would enable KMI to refuse to accept 
coal bed methane production for 
transportation, thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal 
means of downstream pipeline egress 
out of Powder River production areas," Western Gas added. Producers would 
have to shut in production while 
they construct costly nitrogen facilities. This could "create at least a 
temporary gap in the downstream 
movement of coal bed supplies to mid-continent and eastern markets, thus 
frustrating consumer access to 
these significant supplies."

Note:   Update on ammonia plant operations.  Check out the economics in the last paragrph.  LB
Ammonia Industry Finally Approaches Full Production 
Plummeting gas prices have prompted a large number of idled ammonia producers to restart operations this month, after lengthy downtime due to last winter's record gas price increases. Houston-based Industrialinfo.com, which tracks manufacturing, said most of the Gulf Coast and Midcontinent plants are at partial or full capacity. 
An ammonia industry expert at Duke Energy said there has been a 20% increase in ammonia production (222,000 tons of ammonia) since August, representing about 7.6 Bcf of gas demand (34 MMBtu per ton of ammonia). There was a doubling of ammonia productive capacity in Louisiana alone. "We think just about every plant in the U.S. is back on or in the process of coming back up right now," he said. "Obviously they are not going to be running full out, but every plant is coming back up." 
A year ago, ammonia producers were rocked by soaring natural gas prices, which reached $10/MMBtu, up from a historical average of $2. Combined with product overcapacity, the rising costs caused a wave of plant shutdowns across the country. Louisiana was particularly hard hit, with five out of eight ammonia plants idled during the summer. Arkansas, Georgia and Texas were among other ammonia producing states affected. 
The recent decline in gas prices and inventory, however, has sparked some ammonia producers into ramping up production. Triad Nitrogen and PCS Nitrogen both resumed full production in September at their respective plants in Donaldsonville and Geismar, LA, Industrial Information reported. Terra Industries restarted a Verdigris, OK, plant after an extended shutdown and is expected to bring its Blytheville, AK, plant online sometime this month. Koch Industries and IMC Agrico, with plants in Sterlington, Donaldsonville, Convent and Uncle Sam, LA, are now operating at partial capacity. 
Other ammonia manufacturers are waiting to see if natural gas prices remain stable before resuming production. DuPont in Beaumont, TX, Borden Chemical in Geismar, LA, and PCS in Augusta, GA, remain idled. 
"It looks as if these guys are going to make money running their plants all winter," the Duke Energy ammonia industry expert said. "They are making less and less money as gas prices rise and ammonia prices fall. I see them at the closest to break-even by February where gas is averaging about $2.85. 
"Last year the domestic producer margin was only about $3/ton," he said. "They pretty much broke even in terms of gas costs on average. This year they are probably going to make $20-25/ton of production. At $2.80/MMBtu for gas and 34 MMBtu of gas per ton of production, plus $25/ton of additional costs, it will cost them about $120/ton for ammonia production. In New Orleans they will probably cover that for most of the season."

***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS: NEW POWER PLANTS SOOTHE THE MARKET

Roughly 5,000 MW of new generating capacity in 2001 has helped dampen price 
pressures and stem reliability concerns in California and the West. New plant 
plus significantly reduced summer demand through conservation has put the 
West's capacity margin at 15 percent, but regional balances vary widely. Power 
demand declines have also completely relieved the West Coast gas supply 
shortfall. Despite low hydroelectric output, gas demand for power generation in 
the West is actually down from last year.

*  Energy conservation in response to the retail price increase, cool weather, 
and the slowing economy is the strongest fundamental driver in California. 

*  New power supplies have arrived, but grid operators cannot count on full 
nameplate capacity within the first few months of a new plant's start date.

*  Pacific Northwest hydroelectric resources remain critically low despite low 
demand, raising the specter of reliability problems this winter.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index

ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff "so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was "a tortuous process." 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While "both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof," the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.  The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. "Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power." 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the "index-to-index" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate "to minimize any risk on transportation options." The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.

N. Border Plans Extension to Tap Powder River Basin

Powder River Basin gas producers may be about to get a more direct route to 
Midwest markets. Northern Border Pipeline has released plans to build a new 
325-mile greenfield pipeline from McCabe, MT, to Gillette, WY, to tap the 
rapidly growing production in the Powder River, which is estimated to hold 
between 10 and 30 Tcf of gas. 

The basin's rapid production growth has captured the attention of the 
industry, with numerous proposed pipelines, including several new interstate 
plans that would bring gas to the Midcontinent gas grid. Northern Border's 
project, called the Bison Pipeline, would add a new route out of the basin 
for between 375,000 and 500,000 MMBtu/d of production starting in November 
2003. The pipeline is holding an open season on the proposal through Dec. 5. 

Receipt points are proposed with Bighorn, Fort Union Gas Gathering, MIGC and 
Thunder Creek Gas Services. A bi-directional interconnect accessing Williston 
Basin Interstate Pipeline's Baker storage field also is proposed. 

The connection with Northern Border will provide Powder River producers with 
direct access to several local distribution companies, including 
Montana-Dakota, Alliant Interstate Power, MidAmerican Energy, Nicor Gas, 
People Gas and Nipsco. It also provides access to ANR Pipeline, Midwestern, 
NGPL, Northern and Vector. 

The projected recourse rate is 26 cents/Dth/d, but a negotiated 10-year 
demand rate cuts 4 cents off that. The pipeline is offering 
"mileage-sensitive rates," which are expected to allow a shipper to tailor 
supply access and optimize transportation value. 

Northern Border plans to hold a briefing on the project in Denver on Nov. 14. 
For more information, contact project director Paul Miller in Omaha, NB, at 
(402) 398-7758 or James Hoff in Denver at (303) 575-6475, or see the 
pipeline's Web site at www.northernborderpartners.com.

Kern River Plans Expansion to Serve California Generators
 
posted 10:38 AM (CST) Nov 15, 2000 

Kern River Gas Transmission said it plans to file an application today with 
FERC to add 124,500 Dth/d of additional firm transportation capacity to its 
922-mile pipeline system. The California Expansion Project will provide 
additional capacity from Wyoming to markets in California. It also will 
provide an opportunity for Williams to offer significantly reduced rates for 
firm transportation based on recent approval of its Extended Term Rate 
Program, the company said.

"A combination of rapid growth and the development of new gas-fired power 
generation facilities in California is fueling expansion of the system," said 
Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River and Northwest 
Pipeline. The FERC application proposes construction of three new compressor 
stations, an additional compressor at an existing facility in Wyoming, 
restaging a compressor in Utah, and upgrading two meter stations. The $80 
million project is targeted to be complete by May 1, 2002.

El Paso Says It's Open to Expansion of System
El Paso Natural Gas "is willing to expand its system" to the California 
border if "sufficient support" for such a project can be demonstrated through 
long-term capacity contracts, the pipeline told FERC. 
The pipeline's comments were in response to a Commission inquiry asking El 
Paso to consider the feasibility of upgrading its proposed Line 2000 
crude-oil conversion project to a system expansion to help ease the pipeline 
capacity crunch in the West.  Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of 
Energy Projects, raised the prospect in a Jan. 3 letter to El Paso, saying 
that modifying the project "could assist the difficult situation" now facing 
the California gas market. 
Specifically, the Commission has recommended that El Paso amend a pending 
application in which it seeks to acquire an existing 30-inch diameter, 
1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P., and 
convert part of it to natural gas transportation service. The line extends 
from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso plans to convert to gas service 
a 785-mile segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ. El Paso proposed the Line 
2000 project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a 
system expansion. 
However, "there are several ways that an expansion could be accomplished," 
wrote El Paso Vice President Al Clark on Jan. 15. "El Paso could add 
compression to the proposed Line 2000 project, or it could replace or 
recommission the compression that the pending application proposes to abandon 
in place." As a third option, he said El Paso could add new compression to 
its existing system or loop either the existing system or Line 2000 project. 
The "preferable method will have to be determined by a careful analysis of 
the relative costs and a determination of where shippers want the capacity, 
i.e. where they want to put gas into El Paso's system and where they want the 
gas delivered," Clark said. 
As a "first step" towards gauging market support for an expansion, he noted 
that El Paso on Jan. 12 posted 1.2 Bcf/d of California-bound pipeline 
capacity for sale effective June 1 of this year. The capacity currently is 
held by affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy, whose contracts expire May 31. 
When the posting results are known, "El Paso will determine whether another 
open season is needed to solicit expressions of interest in additional 
pipeline capacity to serve markets both into and upstream of California." 
If El Paso finds there is an "unmet demand for additional capacity" on its 
system, the pipeline at that time "will evaluate whether an expansion of the 
existing system or a modification of the Line 2000 project, or both, is the 
appropriate means of accomplishing the expansion," Clark noted. 
In the meantime, he urged the Commission to approve El Paso's application for 
the Line 2000 project as it was filed. Not only will the project "increase 
the operational flexibility" of El Paso's current system, but converting the 
line from oil to gas service will be a "necessary prerequisite" to any future 
expansion of the pipeline's system, according to Clark.

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

"[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants," Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. "No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time."

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: The Storm Continues
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2199


Overview: Although weather has allowed some break in gas prices over the past 
two weeks,
the pressure in the market remains. Storage inventories look likely to reach
record low levels by the end of February, with a month of winter still to 
come.
This pressure means

* The 4.4 Bcf per day of demand currently priced out of the gas market is
likely to remain out of the market through February.

* Henry Hub price is expected to average $8.00 per MMBtu for February.

NATURAL GAS REPORT--RESIDENTIAL GAS COSTS RISING
Residential costs for gas will rise this winter as the wholesale cost of
natural gas has doubled since last year. Local distribution companies
will feel opposing pressures of reducing the impact on customers,
while recouping their costs.

* This is not a one-year phenomenon. Wholesale prices are expected
to remain high through 2003.

* Rising gas prices were previously overshadowed by high heating
oil costs, but the spotlight will soon turn to gas as residential prices
could rise by 50 percent or more.

El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline Staff

El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more 
than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural 
Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in 
Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected 
sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has 
been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said. 

The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline 
systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II. 
Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline 
system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western 
region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate 
Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern 
region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be 
headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern 
region headquartered in Birmingham, AL. 

John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso 
Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural 
Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently 
responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the 
United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as 
presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J. 
Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C. 
Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James 
Yardley will report to Somerhalder. 

"This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's 
pipeline system," said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. "Our upcoming merger with 
Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation, 
border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly 
disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper 
balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also 
facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and 
speeds the merging of separate company cultures." 

While the companies will be organizationally merged, the five pipeline 
systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names. Though 
many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be 
consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters, field functions and 
related activities will remain in their current locations. In addition, some 
employees will remain in the El Paso and Detroit locations. The company will 
ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation. 
Those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages. 
Most moves will occur during the first half of next year, and the majority of 
the plan is expected to be implemented by mid-2001. 

The companies announced their $16 billion polling-of-interests transaction in 
January (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19). The merger is expected to be accretive to 
El Paso's earnings per share (EPS) immediately and add more than 5% to EPS in 
both 2001 and 2002, Wise said at the time of the merger announcement. 
Overall, the two companies expect $200 million in cost savings. By 
comparison, the El Paso-Sonat merger created more than $100 million in 
savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs. 

The combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist 
of over 58,000 miles of pipeline, by far the most of any pipeline company in 
North America. The system will transport more than 20 Bcf/d of gas through 
existing pipeline infrastructure, but will have sole or part ownership in 
three other new or proposed major pipelines, including Alliance, Gulfstream 
and Independence. The company also will be the second largest gatherer of 
natural gas in the United States and the third largest U.S. producer of gas.

A hydrostatic test of Line 3201 identified some pipe that must be replaced, 
El Paso said Thursday, 
and once that is done the test must be performed again. It estimated the 
project will extend through 
Sunday, reducing Bondad Mainline capacity by 180 MMcf/d (normal capacity is 
675 MMcf/d) and 
affecting seven receipt points. With Line 3201 out of service, the 180 MMcf/d 
loss can not be made
 up at points downstream of Bondad Mainline, El Paso said. Thus the same (not 
additional) 
180 MMcf/d reduction must be applied at Gallup (NM) Station. 

PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest said its Internet-based nomination system 
became operational 
again Thursday morning after a Wednesday evening power failure caused the 
server to crash. 

El Paso will hold meetings Aug. 9 in Houston, Aug. 10 in Los Angeles and Aug. 
11 in Phoenix to present 
details of its Line No. 2000 Project. The project requires FERC approval to 
abandon certain mainline 
compressor facilities and replace them with a 30-inch crude oil pipeline upon 
its conversion to natural 
gas service. El Paso announced early this year (see Daily GPI, Feb. 4) it was 
buying part of the 
All American Pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. and would invest 
$75 million to convert 
the segment to a natural gas pipeline. The segment being converted extends 
1,088 miles from Emidio, 
CA, to McCamey, TX. Those planning to attend one of next week's meetings 
should call Lisa Holmes at 
(915) 496-2568 or send e-mail to holmesl@epenergy.com.

ONEOK Acquires 56,200 Dth/d From Williams
 
Williams and ONEOK reported yesterday that they have reached a two-year 
agreement in which Williams will provide incremental firm transportation 
service of 56,200 Dth/d to the Oklahoma Natural Gas (ONG) division of ONEOK. 

"We have had a long-standing relationship with ONEOK through our service to 
its Kansas Gas Service division and we look forward to helping ONEOK serve 
its growing energy needs in Oklahoma," said Kim Cocklin, senior vice 
president of Williams Gas Pipeline-SouthCentral (Central and Texas Gas 
systems). 

Service will begin on Nov. 1, and will require Williams to build two new 
meter stations along its existing pipeline system. A spokesman for ONG said 
the gas load from Williams was necessary to serve its steadily growing 
customer base of approximately 800,000 as the company unbundles its services. 
The transportation capacity will be used to serve customers in ONG's Oklahoma 
City and Enid, OK, markets.

After canceling last week's Unauthorized Overpull Penalty situation Friday 
(see Daily GPI, Nov. 13), El Paso reinstated the OFO Monday until further 
notice. The Window Rock (AZ) B Station was brought back partially online late 
Saturday afternoon, causing the previous 250 MMcf/d reduction of North 
Mainline capacity to fall to 150 MMcf/d. That level of constraint will remain 
in effect until the next block of compression becomes available sometime this 
week, the pipeline said.

Note:  Did this request really happen this way?  Why would the FERC ask one 
pipeline to expand and not all of them feeding
the state.  What have you all heard?

FERC Asks El Paso to Expand

A key FERC staffer this week asked El Paso Natural Gas to consider switching 
its Line 2000 crude-oil conversion from a replacement project to an expansion 
of its existing system to ease pipeline capacity constraints to the 
California border. 

"I am writing to inquire about the feasibility of modifying the...project in 
a manner which could assist the difficult situation now confronting the 
California gas market," said Daniel M. Adamson, director of FERC's Office of 
Energy Projects. 

In August, El Paso filed an application to acquire an existing 30-inch 
diameter, 1,088-mile crude oil pipeline from Plains All American Pipeline 
L.P., and convert part of it to natural gas transportation. The line extends 
from McCamey, TX, to Bakersfield, CA. El Paso seeks to convert the 785-mile 
segment from McCamey to Ehrenberg, AZ, to gas. El Paso proposed the Line 2000 
project as a loop line to replace existing compression, and not as a system 
expansion. 

"It appears that if El Paso kept the six...compressor stations on the line 
and implemented any necessary facility additions and modifications to 
integrate the converted line with its existing South System, it may be 
possible for El Paso to increase its delivery capacity into California," 
Adamson said. 

He asked El Paso to consider this option, given "the current difficult energy 
situation there [in California] and the consequent need to examine all 
possible options for substantive relief" of the situation. "I am interested 
in your thoughts on this matter, including the feasibility of such an 
expansion, the magnitude of facilities and costs which might be involved, who 
would bear those costs, and possible procedural approaches." 

If this "is not a viable option, please indicate whether El Paso is 
considering other options for system expansion which would enhance gas 
transmission capacity into California," Adamson wrote.

Olympian Status for U.S. Gas Market 

Just so you'll know: "The natural gas market is a real success story. ...FERC 
has gotten an enormous amount of things right. The market may not be 
unblemished, but there are lots who consider the natural gas market the best 
market in the world offering genuine price discovery on a daily basis across 
dozens of products. It's something everyone should be proud of," Robert Levin 
of the New York Mercantile Exchange told a FERC conference yesterday. 

"The natural gas market has performed remarkably admirably through a range of 
market conditions with hundreds, if not thousands of market participants, 
using an extraordinary selection of market instruments," Levin continued, 
adding that the Commission should be supporting the "growth and increased 
sophistication of commerce. You're at that point now." 

Warning against so-called solutions offered by some at the day-long 
conference to increase liquidity or tie the natural gas market to the 
electric market, Levin cautioned, "liquidity cannot be legislated. Don't 
overreact. The electric market is poorly regulated. Remedies from the natural 
gas market should be transferred to the electric market, rather than allow 
the gas market to be corrupted by the regulatory mistakes of the electric 
market. 

"Rather than worry over regulating an hourly market for natural gas, change 
the electric market," which Levin believes has developed its over-emphasis on 
the hourly market because of the artificial tilt toward the spot market. 

But while Levin warned against too much market meddling, others among the 
more than 30 representatives of the industry and its customers testifying at 
FERC's conference on competitive natural gas markets argued for a variety of 
initiatives to increase market liquidity by changing the rules for pipeline 
transportation. 

Eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, promoting expansion of the 
existing pipeline infrastructure (especially in the Northeast), doing away 
with straight-fix-variable (SFV) rate design, review of firm-to-wellhead 
rates in the production region and the allocation of transportation costs 
between the upstream and downstream were among the chief proposals proffered 
by mostly pipeline customers. 

However, greater gas market liquidity shouldn't be confused with increased 
competition in pipeline transportation, municipals and producers told FERC 
staff during a post-Order 637 technical conference Wednesday. "...[W]e're 
concerned the Commission may be equating market liquidity with competition in 
pipeline transportation. The two are not the same," said Arthur Corbin on 
behalf of the American Public Gas Association (APGA), which represents 
municipal gas distributors. 

"Even with greater and greater market liquidity, monopoly power exists in 
[the] pipeline transportation segment. Captive shippers will always require a 
regulated transportation service from any hub to their citygate," he said. 

Much the same holds true for LDCs, noted Bruce Henning, director of energy 
practices for Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc. (EEA), who represented 
the American Gas Association (AGA) at the Commission staff conference. He 
agreed market liquidity has improved immeasurably, but he added "there's not 
a liquid market center at every pipeline receipt or delivery point location. 
Nor is there likely to be market centers in all of these locations in the 
near future..." Consequently, Henning said FERC will need to continue to 
protect producers from market power that accompanies "limited access" to 
pipelines. 

The day-long conference held yesterday in Washington D.C. was the first of 
several that FERC staff plans to hold to explore the impact of the 
Commission's transportation policies on the development of gas markets. 

Christopher A. Helms, president and COO of Panhandle Pipeline Companies, 
urged FERC not to enact policy changes that would place commodity market 
liquidity as the "ultimate goal" at the expense of the transportation market. 
Helms said he advocated policies encouraging pipeline expansions and 
construction of "optimal amounts of additional capacity" to meet the needs of 
the market. "The single most important characteristic for liquidity in the 
natural gas commodity markets is the availability of adequate transportation 
capacity." 

Charles Daverio, vice president of KeySpan Corp., echoed that sentiment, 
saying FERC could increase liquidity in the New York City market and 
elsewhere in the Northeast by promoting construction of new pipeline capacity 
to ensure adequate supplies for the region year-round. This would reduce 
energy costs and enhance reliability, he noted. 

Panhandle's Helms also cautioned against policy changes that would force the 
development of new market centers and hubs. Market centers should be allowed 
to develop at their "own pace," and at locations where the market "sees fit," 
he said. 

EEA's Henning estimated more than 40 "liquid and transparent" market centers 
exist today, which permit industry participants to buy and sell gas daily 
under "extremely competitive" conditions. He said he's "confident" more will 
be added because of the options that they provide to gas customers. As 
another way to enhance liquidity, KeySpan's Daverio --- as well as others --- 
supported eliminating the shipper-must-have-title rule, which requires the 
customer to retain title to the gas while it's being shipped. Doing away with 
the rule would pave the way for the development of new pipeline products and 
services, such as operational balancing and virtual storage, he told the FERC 
staff. 

But Dena Wiggins, an attorney with the D.C. law firm of Sutherland, Asbill & 
Brennan LLP, which represents the Process Gas Consumers Group (industrial gas 
customers), said her group was "very concerned" about efforts to repeal the 
rule. "...I haven't heard anything yet [today] that satisfies the concerns 
that we might have." She noted the Commission already has granted exceptions 
to the shipper-must-have-title rule in certain cases, and should continue 
with this policy where necessary. 

Moreover, Wiggins said industrial customers were increasingly worried about 
the mounting market power of unregulated companies, especially gas marketers. 

At the conference, she also expressed her group's dismay with the pipeline 
compliance filings with Order 637, particularly on the penalty issue. Rather 
than an "improved" penalty structure, pipelines are proposing higher 
penalties, Wiggins said. "[We] continue to be shocked at the absolute 
wholesale departures" from 637. 

BP's Jeff Holligan also waded into the fight against all the new services 
outlined by pipelines in their Order 637 filings, which he said were "nothing 
more than penalties disguised as balancing services that customers can't 
refuse." He urged the Commission to check with a pipeline's customers, noting 
one proposed new "service" is opposed by 100% of the pipeline's 
non-affiliated customers. Some of the proposed services, Holligan said, add 
up to nothing more than degradation of existing long-term firm service. 

Holligan, representing the largest producer in the U.S. and Canada, joined 
other market participants in urging adoption of "standardized allocation 
(sales), standardized penalty levels, and the requirement that all pipelines 
implement a uniform title transfer tracking process." In short, 
"standardizing pipeline services, certainly on an individual pipeline, and 
also to a large extent between and across pipelines is imperative if markets 
are to be highly liquid..Individually negotiated services, where every 
service is a different service, or the adoption of a so-called dual track 
market, are the antithesis of a highly liquid, efficient and competitive gas 
market. Standardization of operational terms of pipeline service is necessary 
to facilitate trading through e-commerce." 

"The Commission should be striving to commoditize pipeline capacity so it can 
be traded along with gas electronically," Holligan said.

Note:  Raymond James and Associates is predicting gas prices to average $4.50 
in 2001.  Consensus First Call estimates 
are now averaging $3.85 for 2001.  Read on to hear what the brokerage houses 
are predicting. Lorna

Raymond James Sends Chills Up Gas Buyers' Spines

Raymond James and Associates gave gas buyers a Halloween shriek yesterday 
that could be producing chills all the way through next April, perhaps even 
all of next year. The firm released a chilly forecast of double digit gas 
prices this winter and said it expects prices to average $4.50/MMBtu in 2001. 

"Regardless of a potentially warm winter, it is highly likely that the United 
States will experience regional shortfalls in gas supply," Raymond James said 
in its latest energy report. "In other words, gas storage should test 
all-time low levels this winter regardless of weather. 

"The situation should get worse, not better, next year. If we end the winter 
at all-time low storage levels and we cannot inject more gas next summer than 
we did this summer, then we should enter next winter with dangerously low 
levels of natural gas," Raymond James added. 

"We believe that the United States will see gas demand increase by about 9 
Bcf/d (or 15%) by the end of 2002 as new gas fired electric generation plants 
come on line. Unfortunately, even if every drilling rig is working, U.S. gas 
supply is likely to increase by less than 4 Bcf/d by the end of 2002. This 
means that gas prices must rise sufficiently to crimp over 5 Bcf/d of demand 
out of the gas supply/demand equation by 2002. At $5/Mcf, only about 1.5 
Bcf/d of demand has been reduced so far. That means that gas prices must go 
higher over the next several years." 

However, Raymond James' bullish predictions are a far cry above the crowd on 
Wall Street. Plenty of other analysts have upped their forecasts recently to 
hair-raising levels. The First Call consensus for 2001 now is up to 
$3.85/MMBtu. But that's still 65 cents less than the Raymond James's 
prediction. 

Not everyone wants to scare the daylights out of buyers, however. Deutsche 
Bank believes analysts and the futures market participants at Nymex "are 
getting bold and in our view maybe too bold." 

"With the natural gas rig count approaching 850, it is hard to believe that 
there will not be a fairly substantial supply response in 2001," Deutsche 
Bank said in its Energy Wire on Friday. "Analysts at the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration are expecting dry gas production to rise to 18.94 
Tcf (51.9 Bcf/d) in 2001, after being stuck at near 18.7 Tcf (51.2 Bcf/d) for 
several years. Our own estimate for 2001 looks for 19.1 Tcf (52.3 Bcf/d) and 
we have seen credible forecasts reaching as high as 19.7 Tcf (54 Bcf/d). In 
general we think the EIA is way too conservative and that our own number is 
more likely to be adjusted higher rather than lower. A gain in domestic 
production of 2 Bcf/d to 53.2 Bcf/d could be doable. Imports appear likely to 
be up 0.5 Bcf/d. If demand rises by 2.5%, that would account for about a 1.5 
Bcf/d gain. All other things equal, this implies that storage can refill and 
suggests that prices are going to come under some downward pressure."

Subject: High Inventories and Weak Jet Demand Shape the Heating Oil
Market - CERA Alert 



Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

I have registered us for attendance on this conference call.  Anyone that 
wants to attend can meet in the Conf Room 697 from 9:00-10:00 a.m. on 
Thursday, October 12.  If any Houston staff want to attend the call, I will 
probably have to register you separately.  Let me know if you would like to 
listen in at the Houston location.

Dear CERA Members and Friends: 

Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude 
prices?? What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful 
calculations?

One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates' (CERA) core businesses has been 
benchmark crude oil price analysis. In our new multiclient study, "The Hole 
in the Barrel", CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the 
structure of the market itself.? We argue the limits and real economic losses 
that can result from misunderstanding these prices - specifically the Brent 
benchmark - in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning, the 
magnitude of which can be significant, often amounting to dollars - not cents 
- per barrel.

As an introduction to this new study, we would like to invite you to 
participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web 
presentation on October 12, 2000.? With the current volatility and high 
levels of energy prices, this conference call will bring clarity to these 
important and relevant issues.

To enroll for the call, please RSVP to 1-800-289-0579 or 719-457-2550 and 
reference the Confirmation Code 984848 in order to participate in the call.

In this detailed study, CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk 
about the oil price.? As part of the study, we: 

* Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and 
consider their long-term future given the steady decline of "wet" barrels, 
including how other price markers might evolve.

* Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues (for a 
given volume of production) than is generally appreciated.

* Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices (absolute 
price level, time and grade differentials), to show where revenue is being 
lost and what can be done to add it back again.

* Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity 
and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming, 
especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that 
they help to manage.

In this evolving New World, while trading may or may not be good for you, not 
understanding the market can be fatal. 

CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS: 
* Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of 
internationally traded crude oils. 
* The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate 
contracts in the Brent market to different sectors of the oil industry 

* The risks and rewards of dealing in the Brent market 

Our speakers will address this topic for 20-30 minutes, with accompanying 
graphics presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer 
period.

SPEAKERS: 
Tim Fitzgerald, Senior Director 
Liz Bossley, Senior Associate 
Ann-Louise Hittle, Senior Director, World Oil 
Julian West, Senior Director, Energy & e-Business

Note:  This research is in sync with what the utilities and industry representatives were saying at the 
Wisconsin Winter Fuels Meeting--that coal prices are up over last year.  LB

Energy Insight News for Friday, October 19, 2001

Utilities should prepare for higher coal prices

Coal prices in the United States were in a trough for so long-take your
pick, 10, 15, 20 years, according to some-that big users-read, power
producers-may have been lulled to sleep.

Well, folks, the wakeup call is soon to be sounded, and, for some major
players, it may sound like a bugle blast in the ear. 

While spot market prices took off as long ago as July 2000, most major
producers were saved from swallowing the huge run-ups on the spot market
because utilities for the most part use long-term contracts to maintain a
hold on their fuel costs. 

However, while the evidence is strictly anecdotal-no buyer wants to tip his
hand to the competition-this much is known: A substantial amount of contract
coal comes off pact in 2002 and 2003. 

And suppliers, who have toiled under the mantra that they would make up for
low prices by increasing productivity-for example, cutting labor costs-are
raring to get what they believe they deserve. 

One big wild card in the upcoming battle for higher prices is how severe the
country's recession will be. Obviously, a long-term downturn dampens energy
usage so utilities and merchant players don't need to replenish their coal
stocks. Read the entire story at http://www.energyinsight.com.

Watson: Enron Upside 'Clearly Worth Doing the Deal' 
Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was "90% sure" that the risk/reward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp. made it "clearly worth doing the deal," because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its non-core businesses. Explaining that his team had "adequately bracketed the downside," as the deal fell together over the past few weeks, Watson said he could not be "99% positive," but noted that the upside was "substantial," and said he had a "good deal of confidence...that we'll be absolutely fine here." 
Dynegy, which announced a $22 billion cash, stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night, joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about 90 minutes. If all goes to plan, the two companies would become Dynegy Inc. by the third quarter of 2002, the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing. 
In the second quarter 2001, Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of 36.2 Bcf/d of gas, which represented 21% of the volumes sold by the top 20 gas marketers in North America (168.9 Bcf/d), according to a ranking by NGI. Enron was the top gas marketer with 25.3 Bcf/d and Dynegy was No. 6 with 10.9 Bcf/d. Statistics provided by Maryland-based Energy Performance Review (EPR) show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold 143,824 million kWh of power in the second quarter. That total represented 14% of the power sold by the top 20 largest power marketers (1,000,961 million kWh), according to EPR. Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with 73,724 million kWh sold, while Dynegy was in sixth place with 70,100 million kWh. 
The blending of the two will not come without challenges, but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems. The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron. Greg Whalley, Enron's president and a future member of Dynegy's executive team, confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company, the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year. 
"We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital," said Whalley. "Under normal market conditions, we would have had adequate liquidity. This was not normal for Enron. We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year." 
Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge, executives acknowledged there would be some, but did not elaborate. Whalley said that from an "Enron perspective, we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan. Chuck (Watson) has to clear what is core to Dynegy. There are several (assets for consideration to sell) on the list." 
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who will not be part of the management team, but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors, added that Enron already has $4 billion in sales under contract, all expected to close by the end of 2002. "We also have three other significant international assets under contract," said Lay, referring to the among other things, the Dabhol power plant in India. 
Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed, the new Dynegy will become the "primary market player in all markets," but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward, noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty. Enron's financial-backed trading strategy will merge with the "strong asset base" of Dynegy's. 
Dynegy has protected itself on the downside, however. The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. 
Asked about the possibility that some of Enron's marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company, Watson, stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward, said, "if I were in this industry, this is the combination I'd work for. This is an exciting day here. It's been an exciting couple of weeks" creating a "platform for something really special in the future." 
Enron's Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact. "They're accustomed to being part of a winning deal," he said, and "going forward, they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace." As of Monday morning, Whalley said that "activity looks pretty good," and said there had been a positive reception to the merger. "Right now, people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity, and really want to go about establishing or re-establishing the energy franchise." 
Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed. "Most traders want to be part of a winning team. This is a combination that will be a winning team. We have similar issues there as well. The 'A' players will stay around to be part of the winning team." Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete, the new Dynegy will become the "primary player in all markets." He said Dynegy has a "more asset-backed strategy," adding that he has said before that "you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it." By combining the two companies, there will be a blend of Dynegy's asset strategy with Enron's "financial skill set," giving the new entity "more liquidity market-making than Dynegy itself has historically done." 
Added Watson, "both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change there...I'm a strong believer in teams and the team concept. I don't want to see individuals do well if the company doesn't do well. It (will be) imbedded in the whole company." 
Ben Schlesinger, whose company Schlesinger & Associates analyzes the energy industry, said Monday that the big problem in the merger is "whether these two companies are able to pull together...to harness what's there." He said the "two parties are clearly leaders," but theoretically, they will have to streamline their operations. "Both books are fairly strong," he said, and once their efficiencies are put together, the new company will offer "stable returns." In the "very short term," however, Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders. 
Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger. UBS Warburg reiterated its "strong buy" rating on Dynegy, noting that "if successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world." However, UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a "daunting" task in merging the operations and employees. "We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand. In the near-term, Enron must remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running." 
Merrill Lynch's Donato Eassey reiterated the "buy" on Dynegy and "moving to no opinion" on Enron. He said, "Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly, the financial stability, resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job done...Enron's unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy." 
Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, added that despite the size of the new company, "we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business." He noted too that with the combination, "we have modeled a merchant unit that does 25% less business," because of "cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share." Still, Launer said Dynegy would become a "formidable competitor" benefiting from a market share in excess of 20% of U.S. natural gas and power trading markets." 
As expected with most major merger announcements, Moody's Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, noting that "notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger, the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's credit fundamentals." The review affects about $4 billion of Dynegy securities, including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp. and Illinois Power Co. 
In its rating review, Moody's said it will "assess Dynegy's plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enron's off-balance sheet transactions and contingent risks...and examine the ultimate structure of the transaction, and its impact on Dynegy's financial leverage and on management's targeted debt levels." The ratings service also plans to "consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate." 
Ratings under review are: Dynegy's Prime-3 rating for commercial paper; Dynegy Holdings' Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper; Illinova Corp.'s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating; and Illinois Power Co.'s Baa1 senior secured and Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper. 
Fitch revised its rating watch on Enron's outstanding securities to "evolving" from "negative," where they were placed in late October. The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained. Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holding's long-term credit ratings, which also means they could be lowered or affirmed. The outstanding "F2" rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected.

Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
"We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s," said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. "Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather." 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
"This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather," said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

I didn't realize the report that I sent out yesterday about the California Energy Commission's conclusions on the state's natural gas infrastructure was so long!  Here is a brief synopsis.  I hope this helps everyone.  I haven't had time to read the full report yet, but if I see a better summary come out, I'll send it to you as well.

CEC Blames Overtaxed In-State Gas System for High Prices 
Confirming what the state's energy crisis made abundantly clear months ago, the California Energy Commission (CEC) staff last week released its final draft report on the state's natural gas infrastructure, concluding that it is constrained and has caused higher-than-average wholesale gas prices, particularly in the southern half of the state. But the report did not totally rule out market manipulation as a culprit. 
It concludes that a combination of infrastructure shortcomings and possible market manipulation has to the higher natural gas prices in California. "Market participants may have manipulated prices even higher than justified by existing infrastructure bottlenecks, but it is the inability of gas customers to rely on competition between gas suppliers that contributed to higher prices in California," the report stated. 
Among a half dozen recommended steps the state can take to help bolster initiatives already under way by utilities and merchant energy suppliers, said the CEC report, which will go to the five-member commission for approval Aug. 22. It stressed encouraging the development of more "independent" gas storage facilities, and taking steps to more fully "optimize" storage, including an increase in its use by large end-users. 
As a backdrop to the study's conclusions, the CEC report noted that both upgrades of in-state infrastructure and interstate pipeline capacity are needed to meet "growing demand in California and throughout the West." If the current proposed interstate pipeline expansions don't come online as scheduled, the CEC report said other state actions would be necessary, although it did not spell out what those might be. 
For the future, the report said that the CEC will track more closely storage levels and natural gas prices because they are "key indicators" of how extensive problems might be at any given time in the state's natural gas infrastructure. 
The other steps recommended for action are: 1) encouraging more in-state natural gas production (the state legislature already has proposed a new law to provide incentives); 2) setting new "design criteria and reliability standards" for the state's gas system to reflect what the CEC calls "the changing nature of natural gas demand, especially for electric generators;" 3) establishing integrated planning of the state's pipeline and storage facilities; and 4) developing a "natural gas curtailment scheme" emphasizing efficiency and optimizing gas use in times of shortages. 
The 111-page report, "Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues," prepared by the CEC Electricity and Natural Gas Committee for final adoption of the five-member politically appointed commission, assessed the state gas industry from the perspective of supply, pipeline capacity (both inter- and intrastate) and storage, with the added elements of the recent historically severe drought in the Pacific Northwest and the in-state pipeline constraints at the California-Arizona border. 
As part of the proposed implementation, the report recommends that the CEC work more closely with the California Public Utilities Commission to develop a new curtailment policy that is "fair and at the same time promotes the efficient use of natural gas" during shortage periods. It also proposes that the CEC this fall conduct a workshop to determine ways to have non-core, large energy-intensive customers better optimize their use of natural gas storage.

In its preliminary notice of November maintenance, El Paso had scheduled Lines 1300 and 1301 on the San Juan Crossover for total shutdown Nov. 29-30. It said Wednesday the shutdown has been delayed to coincide with the Dec. 1-2 weekend, when all 650 MMcf/d of the crossover's capacity will be cut to zero. Portions of Line 1300 will be shutting down Dec. 11-12 and Dec. 18-19; capacity cuts then will be 60 MMcf/d.

El Paso announced changes to its pipeline cleaning and internal inspection 
program. Line 1100 between Eunice and Pecos River Stations will be smart 
pigged Sunday (postponed one day), causing a 200 MMcf/d flow reduction 
through Eunice to the South Mainline. Six interconnects will not be able to 
deliver into El Paso for 10 hours that day. Another smart pigging of Line 
1100 between Pecos River and Guadalupe Stations will occur Nov. 22 (also 
postponed one day), requiring a reduction of 200 MMcf/d through Pecos River. 
Line 1203 (Maricopa Line) pigging will be done Nov. 21-24, reducing the 
line's capacity by 60 MMcf/d and affecting deliveries of San Juan gas to the 
Phoenix area. Line 3222 pigging will be done Nov. 30 and Dec. 19, causing a 
100 MMcf/d allocation. Line 3201 pigging will be done Dec. 2 and 20, causing 
a 150 MMcf/d allocation. The allocations will affect points upstream of 
Bondad Mainline and Gallup.

Gina, this one is going to   Enron Transportation Services - Houston



I want to take a moment to say "thank you" to all the employees who 
participated in the ETS Food & Toy Drive. We delivered over 10 boxes of food 
and toys on Friday to the Downtown location of the Head Start program.

There are many people in the Houston community who need our help and support, 
especially during the Holiday Season.  Through your kindness, the Head Start 
Program, ETS' adopted United Way agency,  will be able to help those less 
fortunate.

The pictures below capture some of our employees displaying the donations 
that were collected in the Enron building.  The collections in Three Allen 
Center were significant as well.   

Thank you, again, for your overwhelming generosity.

Williams Launches uE Web Site For Cross Commodity Pricing 
Tulsa-based Williams on Monday launched uE, a cross-commodity price index for both spot and future energy prices, as a companion to its web-based EnergyNewsLive.com. Similar to the Dow Jones for equity markets, the Williams uE will offer an equivalent benchmark for the overall price of energy, measuring the price average of eight individual commodities: electricity, natural gas, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, ethane, propane, residual fuel and jet fuel. 
The site includes information on pricing trends including a national spot uE, forward uE, regional uE, commodity quotes, as well as daily, weekly and monthly commentary. Included on the site is EnergyPulse, which will feature Dr. Dennis O'Brien, director of energy and policy at the University of Oklahoma. EnergyPulse now airs every Friday on Williams' EnergyNewsLive site, and offers an analysis of trends in energy pricing and the impact the economy has on energy. 
Williams uE was introduced a year ago when EnergyNewsLive debuted, and Williams said it has tested and refined the site for the company's own market activity. It also has been reviewed by the Energy Information Administration, said Williams. To view the site, visit www.williams-ue.com.

News Brief:
+OGE Energy Corp.'s Enogex Subsidiary Sells Non-Core Assets

OGE Energy Corp. said its Enogex Inc. subsidiary has closed on the sale of
several assets no longer considered vital to its core business. These assets
include interests in oil and gas-producing properties in Utah and three
natural gas-gathering pipeline systems in Oklahoma. Terms of the
transactions were not disclosed. Proceeds from the asset sales, totaling
about $14 million, will be used to pay down short-term debt associated with
Enogex's 1999 acquisition of Transok LLC.

In Utah, Enogex sold all of its interests in its oil and gas properties,
along with all related rights, equipment, real property, leases and
agreements. In Oklahoma, Enogex sold the Piedmont and El Reno systems in
Canadian County and the Fidelity gathering system in Oklahoma County,
including all gathering lines, compressors and equipment along with related
contracts and rights of way.

The Oklahoma sale was to Seminole Gas Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Seminole Energy Services LLC of Tulsa.

Note:  Westpath Expansion plans filed at NEB
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that "with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade." Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that "unconventional gas" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in "tight" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas "is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions." At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that "if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade." 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the "project definition phase," or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it "recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas."

Kinder Morgan to Buy Enron's Share of Trailblazer 
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners L.P. announced Wednesday it has signed a definitive agreement with Enron Trailblazer Pipeline Co. to acquire its 33.3% share for $68 million cash. This will give KMP 100% ownership in the 436-mile line out of the Rockies into the Midwest. 
Kinder Morgan is the operator of the pipeline that runs from Rockport (Weld County), CO, to Beatrice (Gage County), NE. 
"We are delighted to increase our ownership in Trailblazer, which generates reliable cash flow and is expected to experience significant growth in 2002 once our current expansion project is completed," said Richard D. Kinder, chairman of KMP. "Upon closing, the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to KMP unitholders." 
"We have been interested in increasing our ownership of the pipeline since we bought our initial interest in 1999," Kinder said, adding the company has been negotiating with Enron for several months. The transaction, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2002, is subject to standard closing conditions, as well as approvals by the court overseeing the Enron bankruptcy and by the Enron board of directors. 
As previously announced, Trailblazer is currently expanding its transportation capacity to 846,000 Dth/d from 522,000 Dth/d. The additional 324,000 Dth/d of capacity, which is scheduled to come on-line in mid-2002, has already been fully subscribed in the form of long term, firm transportation contracts. 
"We began the $58 million expansion project in August of this year, as significant growth in Rocky Mountain natural gas supplies had created the need for additional pipeline transportation infrastructure," Kinder explained. The expansion project includes installing two new compressor stations and adding additional horsepower at an existing compressor station. 
Through capital contributions, CIG Trailblazer Gas Co. -- an affiliate of El Paso Corp. -- is expected to become a 7-8% equity owner in Trailblazer in mid-2002 when the additional capacity comes on-line.

the basic downside analysis of the reserves that exist in the Alaskan Frontier
as well as the coalbed methane gas.  There will much discussion on this topic
over the next few months.  Anyone that wants a copy of the entire Canadian
Gas Potential Committee report should contact me at 402-398-7573 or go to

Energy Insight News for Thursday, September 20, 2001:


Expectations fall for Canada's natural gas 'frontier'

Canada's arctic north may not be North America's next big natural
gas-producing basin after all. 

In what one geologist said was a "major, major" reduction in estimated
natural gas potential, the Canadian Gas Potential Committee-a volunteer
group of 50 geologists and other professionals who assess Canada's
undiscovered gas potential-last week reported that Canada's frontier basins,
which include the arctic and Mackenzie Delta regions, may hold no more than
60 to 65 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas that ultimately could make it to
market. 

The new estimate falls short of previous estimates that 300 to 400 tcf of
gas could be found in the Beaufort Basin, the arctic islands and Mackenzie
corridor. It was those estimates that helped encourage geologists, producers
and a number of U.S.-based power plant developers to consider the north as
almost a second Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Gas from that
historically prolific yet now declining basin makes up around 15% of U.S.
imports. 

"We thought the gas was greener," said Rob Woronuk, a senior analyst with
the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. 

Still more potentially bad news came from the committee's report. 

In what Woronuk said was an "embarrassment," the committee has now decided
that Canadian coalbed methane may have less of a role to play than was
previously thought. 

The committee reversed the findings of its 1997 report that estimated
coalbed methane could account for up to 270 tcf of Canada's overall 570 tcf
natural gas resource.

In a letter last month (see Daily GPI, Oct. 19), Northwest announced a policy 
revision allowing a shipper holding capacity from Sumas to off-system 
delivery points to amend primary delivery points and shorten the path without 
being subject to a contractual OFO upon extending its contract term. However, 
citing "the current OFO situation on the pipeline system," Northwest said 
last week the policy change is under review and has been suspended until 
further notice. 


El Paso reported Thursday an injection unit at its Washington Ranch storage 
facility had gone down for emergency maintenance. Capacity through Pecos 
River Station has been reduced by 100 MMcf/d until further notice, causing 
the pipeline to impose allocations on Permian Basin production and deliveries 
of San Juan Basin gas to the South Mainline. 


El Paso said work on Lines 1106 and 1107 was extended by one more day, 
causing the shut-in of deliveries into El Paso at the IUTBENED and IHYBENDM 
interconnects to continue through Dec. 1. The delay also postpones scheduled 
work on Line 3137, which now will be shut in Dec. 4-5, affecting the 
IVALEROZ, ISONORA, ISHOZONA and IBARNHRT points. Line 3177 is scheduled for 
Dec. 7 inspection, affecting IMOBILPE.

Note:  Ken Lay's comments at the "Governors' Natural Gas Summit:  Responding 
to the Growing Energy Crisis" are quoted in this article.

Industry Fears Consumer Backlash Because of High Prices 

The natural gas industry should be prepared to face customer revolts and 
attempts at price caps, similar to those witnessed this summer in San Diego 
if it's a cold winter and prices continue to hit new highs. That was the 
warning from government and industry representatives at the crisis conference 
held by the Interstate Oil & Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC) yesterday. 

Representatives of producing states and industry speakers were unanimous in 
opposing government intervention to restrain prices, but no one had a ready 
remedy for consumer reaction if they are hit with a double whammy of greater 
energy use at higher prices this winter. One speaker offered a bright spot: 
the industry might emerge relatively unscathed if the winter is moderate. But 
then he added it's not just residential heating bills, but electric bills as 
well that will be impacted by higher natural gas prices. Others pointed out 
that demand and higher prices could spur lawmakers to open more areas to 
drilling and encourage new long lines. 

"Industrial customers have been dealing with high prices for some time, but 
higher bills for residential and small commercial customers are just starting 
to hit the radar screen," Peggy Claytor, purchasing manager for steel-maker 
The Timken Co., told the group of more than 300 from the U.S., Canada and 
Mexico, meeting in Columbus, OH. "We may see protests or proposals or calls 
for price caps this winter." She said she is opposed to caps because they 
fail to solve the underlying problems, and she blamed the "dysfunctional 
electricity grid" in part for aggravating the run-up in natural gas prices. 

Asked whether he expected to see a public outcry from residentials this 
winter, Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, whose San Diego Gas & 
Electric subsidiary has borne the brunt of the California debacle (and whose 
prices were capped), had a one word answer: "Absolutely." 

Enron Chairman Ken Lay agreed. "If we have a combination of a cold winter 
with high prices, it could send bills up quite substantially. Certainly, 
there could be some reaction." Lay said he expected prices to be high for the 
short to medium term, coming down over next two to three years. "As long as 
regulators leave it alone, this market will come back into balance." Lay 
pointed out that even if prices to consumers hit $8.20/Mcf this winter, it 
would be just equal to the price level, adjusted for inflation, in 1986. 

Even at today's prices, "energy is the best buy there is," Robert Allison, 
Jr., chairman of Anadarko Petroleum, told the group, pointing out how 
consumer prices for other basics such as houses and cars, have increased over 
the past 15 years. The problem with energy prices is they have stayed low for 
so long. 

If the government wants to take action, it should open more public lands to 
drilling, Allison said, estimating there are 213 Tcf of reserves--- or a 
10-year supply --- that are off limits in the lower 48 states. Only portions 
of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska are effectively open for drilling. "It's up 
to Congress to provide greater access," Allison said. 

Others, including Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, said government should encourage 
the building of additional pipeline capacity, particularly a new pipeline 
from Alaska. 

Leading off the "Governors' Natural Gas Summit: Responding to the Growing 
Energy Crisis," Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research 
Associates, called the current situation a "shock," not a "crisis." A lack of 
reserves would be a crisis, but there are plenty of reserves. It's simply 
that demand has accelerated and bumped up against the "iron law of lead 
times." He said the industry would have to invest more than $500 billion over 
the next ten years, nearly double the level of the 1990s, to keep up with new 
markets. 

Yergin called for the U.S. to coordinate supply development policy with 
Mexico and Canada. "This is not just a U.S. issue. And there will not be just 
U.S. solutions --- there must be a continent-wide response." 

In the meantime, the industry should attempt to cushion the short-term shock 
through consumer education, conservation and low income assistance programs.

FERC Limits Public Access to Pipe, Transmission Maps 
Amid concerns over potential terrorist attacks on energy facilities, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is limiting the public's access to maps of natural gas pipelines and electric transmission lines. 
In a statement of policy, the Commission said it would "no longer make available to the public" maps of these energy facilities through the Internet, the Records and Information Management System (RIMS) and the Public Reference Room at its headquarters in Washington, DC. 
Persons wishing to view the maps, however, can make requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) at the Commission. FERC staff has been urged to "respond timely to legitimate requests" for such documents. 
The Commission said the ban would remain in effect indefinitely and directed staff to report on the impact of this action on agency business within 90 days. The move by FERC was not as drastic as some federal agencies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which closed down its entire web site last week as a precaution. 
Given the anthrax scares on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, a spokeswoman said the Commission also has been instructed to alert security immediately about suspicious envelopes and packages.

News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects 
2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000
 
After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent 
agreements 
for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline 
and related 
SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two 
projects 
have been pending at FERC for more than three years.

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas 
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in 
Pennsylvania. 
The "tentative" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their 
downstream 
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be 
operating 
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and 
National 
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an 
investment 
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the "greenfield" Independence project over 
significant 
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they 
were not 
convinced the new precedent agreements provided "sufficient evidence" of 
market 
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at 
least 35% 
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.

Bush Administration Extends Emergency Supply Orders
Despite recent indications that the Bush administration would take a more 
hands-off approach to the California crisis, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham 
late yesterday gave PG&E and Southern California Edison another two weeks of 
breathing room by extending emergency orders requiring gas and power 
suppliers to continue supplying the cash-strapped utilities. The emergency 
gas order now expires at 3 a.m. (EST) Feb. 7. 
In granting the extensions, Abraham urged the state to get to work to solve 
its own problems. He said only California can implement the policies 
necessary to resolve the short-term and long-term supply challenges. "Our 
action today is designed to give the governor, the California legislature and 
other relevant parties the time to take necessary action. I strongly urge the 
parties to act immediately," said Abraham. He also said he was keenly aware 
that other western states have expressed concerns about their own supply 
situation and the impact the order is having on power prices in their areas. 
Despite the action, PG&E said it still is having trouble getting gas 
suppliers to comply with the emergency order originally issued Jan. 19. "The 
gas supply situation is [not good]," utility spokeswoman Staci Homrig said 
yesterday afternoon. "We are quickly depleting our storage. Even under the 
order, J. Aron & Co. [a subsidiary of Goldman Sachs] has not delivered gas. 
They represent about 9% of our daily needs (1.5 Bcf/d in January). 
"Oh yeah, we've been in contact with them," she said. "We've been in contact 
with the DOE, too. The other two suppliers who had stopped delivering gas to 
us last week have made gas available to us under the order. They are Sempra 
Energy Trading and Western Gas Resources." Homrig said PG&E expected DOE to 
take legal action against those who didn't resume deliveries. The order 
applied to 27 gas suppliers, all of which supplied gas to PG&E within the 
last 30 days. 
"There's not a lot I can say," said J. Aron spokeswoman Kate Baum. "J. Aron 
has always complied with the law and we intend to comply with this order. 
That's my statement. I can neither confirm nor deny anything else." 
Meanwhile, other suppliers who were not among those on the DOE's list, were 
staying as far away from California as possible. "All I know is we're not 
selling in California any more. A person could get fired around here for 
doing that," said one marketer. "All we had in California were a few spot 
deals that expired at the end of December. Needless to say we didn't re-up 
them." 
Without the DOE's order, PG&E would be back where it was last week, with some 
suppliers stopping delivery, others planning to stop at the end of their 
contract terms and most suppliers unwilling to sell additional gas to the 
utility. 
PG&E has said it has enough gas in storage to make up for the lost supply 
under such a scenario until the first week in February. Homrig said PG&E's 
storage currently is well below 50% full, or less than 16 Bcf and depleting 
rapidly by about 500 MMcf/d to 1 Bcf/d. PG&E's Pipe Ranger web site shows the 
utility has been averaging about 500 MMcf/d of withdrawals over the past 
several days and is expecting a slight increase over the next few days. 

CA Launches New Buying Program; Supplies Remain Tight
Depending on your perspective, California either moved toward future 
solutions to its nagging energy crisis or took several steps backward 
yesterday with the launch of its electricity bulk buying program for 
long-term, fixed-price supplies. 
The auction began yesterday and will run through noon today. The state is 
seeking sealed bids for six-month, three-year, five-year and 10-year supply 
agreements. Whether results of the auction would be made public was still 
unclear yesterday, but the results are expected to be given to legislators, 
who now are debating various long-term solutions in the state senate. 
A spokesperson in the state Assembly Speaker's office said the legislature is 
basically "standing by," awaiting more price information. Action on the 
proposed comprehensive legislation, including the question of the state 
taking over the private utilities' hydroelectric systems, should come by the 
end of the week. 
Merrill Lynch said yesterday it was "increasingly skeptical" that the 
"securitization for hydro" plan would go forward. It has received "muted 
support," Merrill Lynch said, and has not been drafted as a bill yet. Recent 
revisions of the comprehensive bill show some progress on contract 
flexibility, with the possibility that the value of the entire portfolio of 
energy contracts might be capped at a weighted average price of $55/MWh, 
which is well below the utilities retail rate caps (Edison at $72.40/MWh and 
PG&E at $66). The difference is expected to be used to pay down the 
utilities' debt. 
Meanwhile, the electric system limped along under the specter of another 
Stage Three yesterday, but without rolling blackouts, and elsewhere 
indications outside the state were that some energy marketers have written 
off California from their prospective marketing lists. 
"We're not selling in California any more, a person could get fired for doing 
that around here," said one Texas-based gas marketer, referring to the 
continuing credit problems of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which has been 
hobbled by the weight of its wholesale electricity debts on the natural gas 
side, too. 
In the meantime, Southern California Edison Co. is back in federal district 
court in Los Angeles, where it obtained a favorable initial ruling two weeks 
ago. This time it is asking for the court to force the California Public 
Utilities Commission to allow it to raise its rates to cover the wholesale 
cost of power. 
Calling the action with the court "a last resort," Edison said it has tried 
to get the rate situation resolved, but at every turn it has met "resistance, 
denial and finger-pointing" by the CPUC's five-member governor-appointed 
board. 
The CPUC on Tuesday acted to anticipate new state legislation regarding the 
hydroelectric systems in the state by canceling hearings it had scheduled 
this week and next to go exclusively to written comments for the 
environmental review of the ongoing case looking at PG&E's hydro utility 
assets. "The current energy crisis in the state makes it prudent for the 
commission to shift from public hearings to written testimony," the CPUC said 
in a prepared statement.

Note:  Alliance announced an October 30 official in-service date for tariff 
services; however, they will be selling test gas in 
ramp up period.  Right now, these first deliveries are going into the ANR 
system because it is the only interconnect that is 
ready.

Alliance Delayed, But Deliveries Begin Ramping Up

After months of speculation in the industry, Alliance Pipeline confirmed 
yesterday full commercial service will be delayed nearly a month until Oct. 
30. When construction of the system was scheduled nearly three years ago, 
Oct. 2 was the target date for commercial service. 

However, the delay doesn't mean the market won't be getting any Canadian gas 
out of Alliance until the end of October. The pipeline opened one of its 
Chicago delivery valves last Thursday and started selling 50-100 MMcf/d of 
gas into the market. It intends to increase its sales each week eventually 
reaching its full 1.325 Bcf/d load prior to switching to commercial service 
on Oct. 30, said spokesman Jack Crawford. 

"We got Commission approval to actually sell our test gas. Right now I think 
we are dealing with three or four different marketers. Our initial deliveries 
right now are into the ANR system. That's because its basically the only 
connection that is ready, but over the next few weeks we expect they will all 
be ready to go and we will test them all. 

"I'd be surprised if it ends up being regular [volume increases of 100 MMcf/d 
each week] but that's kind of the game plan," said Crawford. "On Oct. 29 it 
will be Alliance selling [1.325 Bcf/d of] test gas, and on Oct. 30 it will be 
shippers nominating at one end and delivering at the other. The market may 
not see much of a difference. We obviously don't want to start charging our 
shippers until we have the confidence that all the systems have been checked 
out." 

The pipeline system is designed to deliver gas from producing regions of 
northeastern British Columbia and northwestern Alberta to the Chicago area 
where the line interconnects with the North American pipeline grid. 
Currently, more than 99% of the total pipeline system has been installed, 
including 14 mainline compressor stations, 37 receipt points in British 
Columbia and Alberta, and 7 delivery points in Illinois. Commissioning 
activities commenced in March, including the flowing of gas into the 
completed sections of line to purge air from the pipe. At present, 
approximately 95% of Alliance has been purged of air. This includes all the 
mainline portion of the system (1,857 miles) from near Gordondale, Alberta to 
the delivery section near Joliet, Illinois and 306 of 434 mile laterals 
receipt portion of the system. Additionally, 25 receipt point meter stations 
have been commissioned. Final commissioning activities are also being 
completed at 14 mainline compressor stations. To date, 6 Bcf of gas is in the 
commissioned mainline and lateral portions of the system, with the ultimate 
line pack targeted at 8 Bcf. 

Crawford said there were a variety of factors that contributed to the delayed 
start-up. "The rain in Saskatchewan delayed us a bit back in July, but we 
managed to catch up on the construction there in August. But it then meant 
that some of our commissioning didn't get going until a little bit later. 
Farther west in Alberta and BC in fact we've had a couple of rain problems. 
In particular, we have one relatively small but fairly long lateral that we 
haven't even been able to get on the right of way yet and that's because of 
rain. 

"Up in BC we've been having trouble with a directional drill of a creek on 
one of our laterals up there," he said. "We're likely to get approval to 
open-cut that creek, but that will take us probably the better part of a 
month. 

"On the downstream end, we had hoped to get more of our downstream 
connections right now. We are testing one, but some of the others aren't 
quite ready yet. We're ready, but they are not. Then of course there is a 
fairly complex interaction between the pipeline and the [Aux Sable liquids] 
plant. We haven't had a chance to work on that yet. So when you look at all 
of those things, the question was when could we establish a date when all 
this stuff would be done and we would be operational. We spent a fair amount 
of time with our shippers and they mentioned one other pipeline that was 
being delayed one day at a time drove them to distraction. We agreed we would 
pick one of three dates, all Mondays: Oct. 2, Oct. 16 or Oct. 30, and we just 
had to pick one that we felt confident in." 

Besides the timing of service, there has been another important question on 
the minds of many market observers. Will the gas Alliance ships come Oct. 30 
be incremental gas or gas that would have been flowing through TransCanada. 

"I don't think it's going to be purely either way," said Crawford. "Lots of 
guys are targeting for Nov. 1 to bring their new gas on to start the gas year 
so it all depends on how much shows up. It's not a big secret that we've had 
some wet weather and some of the drilling and completion work hasn't gotten 
done. That's likely to have some affect on it as well. That's a delay though. 
How long are people going to pay $6 for gas? Boy, people are going to have a 
lot of money for drilling and projects."

Executive News:

PNM terminates merger with Western Resources

Albuquerque, N.M.-based PNM Resources announced Tuesday its board had
officially killed the proposed deal to buy Western Resources' electric
utility subsidiaries. The deal, originally valued at over $4 billion, had
been in trouble for months, and each side sued the other in state court in
New York. PNM said the merger could be terminated after Dec. 31 under the
terms of the deal, if there had not been satisfactory progress made towards
completing the transaction. But Western has disputed that PNM had grounds to
back out of the deal. PNM sued Western in October seeking to get out of the
deal alleging breach of contract, in part because of adverse rulings from
the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) on rates and a Western restructuring
plan considered vital to the transaction.

Western fired back with its own lawsuit a month later, seeking at least $650
million in damages against PNM for alleged extortion, breach of contract,
sabotage and improper interference in the KCC proceedings. Neither case has
been decided, although PNM has asked the court to either dismiss Western's
case or delay action on it until after it has decided PNM's initial suit.
Western also has appealed the KCC order blocking a planned restructuring in
preparation for the PNM transaction to a Kansas district court. Western

Sempra Could Be Takeover Candidate, Newspaper Says
 
The London Telegraph newspaper quoted an analyst who said that U.K.-based 
Centrica could 
be eyeing Sempra Energy as a possible takeover candidate following Centrica's 
purchase of 
Canadian gas and electricity supplier Direct Energy. 

Direct Energy owns a 27.5% stake in Energy America, whose remaining equity 
belongs to Sempra. 
The newspaper quoted Simon Hawkins, an analyst with UBS Warburg, as saying 
the Direct Energy 
acquisition is "step one of something much bigger." In principle, he said, 
there is no reason why 
Centrica shouldn't go after Sempra. Centrica told the newspaper it was 
"talking to Sempra about 
the way forward."

customers. "You are urged to immediately review your supply/demand balance, 
and the performance of your suppliers, to insure sufficient gas is being 
delivered to El Paso to cover the gas being taken off the system," the 
pipeline said. To ensure system integrity, El Paso is placing limits on

Kern River Open Season

Kern River is holding an open season through Aug. 18 to determine interest in 
year-round FT to Nevada 
and California and interest in capacity relinquishment by existing firm 
shippers. The pipeline said it can 
offer significantly reduced FT rates based on recent FERC approval of Kern 
River's Extended Term 
Rate Program (ET Program). Under ET Program, customers could receive a rate 
reduction from $0.64/Dth 
to approximately $0.42 under a 15-year contract. Because system expansion can 
be accomplished by the 
addition of compression facilities, it could result in an overall lowering of 
rolled-in rates for all shippers, Kern 
River said. Depending on open season results, the pipeline is proposing a 
mainline expansion of up to 500 
MMcf/d with an in-service target date of May 1, 2002. If goals can be met 
using relinquished capacity and no 
new facilities are required, new service could begin as early as Oct. 1, 
2001. Call Laurie Brown at 
(801) 584-6410 or Greg Snow at -7270 for more information. 


Panda Links to Transmission Grid for Gila Bend Plant

Panda Energy International inked a firm electrical transmission agreement 
with Arizona Public Service to 
supply power from its proposed natural gas-fired 2,000 MW plant to be located 
in the town of Gila Bend. The 
proposed plant is before the Arizona Corporation Committee for review. Senior 
vice president of merchant 
plant development for Panda, Garry Hubbard, said that the firm contract is "a 
critical step forward for the
plant." The new plant is on schedule to commence construction later this 
year, with start up 18 months later, 
he added. Powering the plant will be eight General Electric 7 FA natural gas 
turbines operating in combined 
cycle.

Note:  With Dynegy as anchor, NGPL is planning on building a lateral into St. 
Louis for the first time.  MRT (a Reliant pipeline)
has been the only pipeline into this market.  


NGPL Plans Lateral to Serve Illinois Power in St. Louis

Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) announced plans to build a new 
47-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline lateral into St. Louis to serve Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system. The $35 million project, which is anchored 
by a contract with Illinois Power affiliate Dynegy Marketing and Trade, will 
add at least 300,000 Dth/d of gas transportation capacity to the St. Louis 
market. 

"The pipeline project and related agreements ideally demonstrate our ongoing 
strategy to expand our natural gas pipeline services into growing markets 
currently not connected to NGPL and to increase throughput on our system by 
adding electric load to our extensive pipeline network," said Richard D. 
Kinder, CEO of Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent company of NGPL. 

The new lateral will extend from Centralia, IL, to a point on Illinois 
Power's gas distribution system in the East St. Louis market. The project is 
scheduled for completion in June of 2002. 

NGPL and Dynegy entered into a number of long-term, gas transportation and 
storage contracts, including a 10-year agreement effective June 1, 2002, 
which will provide Dynegy with 90,000 Dth/d of gas via the new pipeline. In 
addition, NGPL and Dynegy entered into various other firm transportation 
agreements totaling another 98,000 Dth/d of gas sourced from NGPL's Gulf 
Coast and Amarillo lines beginning as early as Dec. 1, 2000. 

The NGPL project effectively creates a new supplier for a geographical area 
that until now has been served by just one natural gas transportation company 
[Mississippi River Transmission], according to Larry F. Altenbaumer, 
president of Illinois Power. "This new connection to Illinois Power's system 
will help open competitive opportunities to natural gas customers in the 
metro east area of St. Louis. It not only provides for a new delivery point 
to service customers directly, but also to fuel electric generation in the 
area. 

"The 10-year agreement to provide firm transportation service to Dynegy 
provides us a solid anchor customer for the pipeline project," said Deb 
Macdonald, president of NGPL. NGPL intends to solicit expressions of interest 
from other shippers in December and January. The results of the open season 
will determine the final scope of the project. 

"With Dynegy as our anchor customer, we will build the new lateral into the 
St. Louis market regardless of whether we receive other expressions of 
interest," said Macdonald. "We anticipate a strong response, however, given 
the size of the market and the potential for additional gas-fired power 
generation." 

Interested shippers should contact Mark Menis, NGPL's director of business 
development, at (630) 691-3347.

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=
st=20
week.
>From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=
on=20
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=
=20
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=

Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=

expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=

market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=

More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=

the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=
e=20
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=

injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=

futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=
=20
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=
n=20
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=
=20
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=
er.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20
heating load
from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=
h CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=
=20
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=
=20
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=
e=20
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=
=20
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
=20
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=

AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

Note:  Add this to the NOAA and Salomon Smith Barney forecasts.  LB
WSI Sees Mild Winter in Northeast, Cold in West 
In contrast to forecasts by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Salomon Smith Barney of a colder-than-normal winter in key energy consuming regions, WSI Corp.'s end-of-October update to its seasonal forecast for November, December and January predicts warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and in the central and southern Plains. WSI, however, said it expects cooler-than-normal temperatures in the Gulf Coast states, Northern Plains, Great Lakes states, and all areas west of the Rocky Mountains. 
"The expectation of below-normal temperatures in the north-central United States during the November-January period is similar to the Oct.18th [NOAA] outlook," said Todd Crawford, a WSI seasonal forecaster. "The most significant difference in our outlooks is that we expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast during the period while CPC is forecasting cooler-than-normal." 
WSI sees the following monthly trends: 
In November, cooler-than-normal temperatures are expected in the western half of the United States, the Northern Plains, and Florida, while warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected across the central and southern Plains and most of the eastern United States. 
In December, cooler-than-normal temperatures are anticipated across much of the country, with the exception of the Southeast, New England, and parts of the Central Rockies. WSI sees numerous Arctic outbreaks to affect the northern Plains states during the month. 
In January, WSI forecasts warmer-than-normal temperatures across the Central and Southern Plains, central Rockies, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic States. Cooler-than-normal temperatures are expected along the Pacific Coast, in the Southwest, Northern Rockies and Northern Plains, and in the Ohio Valley. 
WSI said its three-month seasonal forecasts have been accurate for seven straight periods, and nine out of the last 12. An accurate seasonal forecast is defined as one that is closer to what is actually observed versus a forecast that uses the 30-year average temperature, it said. 
Energy Security Analysis Inc. (ESAI) said the latest WSI forecast for milder temperatures is bearish for gas and power prices. ESAI also said, however, that in the WSCC the outlook for cooler-then-average conditions will translate into higher levels of heating demand. Due to recent poor hydro-generation conditions, power supplies in regions like the Pacific Northwest and northern California could be limited, in which case higher levels of weather-induced demand are likely to bring stronger power prices.

Note:  I'm sure you have this on your radar screen, but just in case you 
don't...

PG&E Corp. announced that its National Energy Group will develop its first 
Nevada project, a 1,000 MW natural gas-fired generating plant to be located 
45 miles northeast of Las Vegas. The merchant plant's main purpose is to 
supply Nevada, but when it is not needed there, it will add much-needed 
supply to the western energy market. The group hopes to begin construction 
during the fourth quarter of 2001, with completion expected in early 2004. 
"Southern Nevada has one of the most rapidly growing economies in the 
country," said Thomas B. King, president of PG&E NEG, West Region. "Because 
of its location near Las Vegas, the Meadow Valley project will be ideally 
positioned to efficiently serve that demand growth." Including the Nevada 
project, PG&E National Energy Group has a total of 4,000 MW in development or 
construction in California, Oregon, Nevada and Arizona.

Subject: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker - CERA Alert




**********************************************************************
CERA Alert: Sent Thu, June 15, 2000
**********************************************************************

Title: Monthly Briefing--The Pressure Cooker
Author: N. American Natural Gas Team
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: North American Gas ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1230 ,

Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market, as three 
factors-increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, and US 
wellhead supply still struggling to rebound-call into question the ability to 
build storage to a level adequate for next winter. As strong as gas market 
fundamentals are, gas prices are being supported also by concurrent strength 
in oil and liquids markets, making traditional alternatives to gas much more 
expensive than in recent years.  In this environment intense competition 
between power generation demand and storage injections will continue 
throughout the summer-with pressure increasing into July as temperatures 
rise-and gas will continue to price at the high levels necessary to 
discourage end-use demand.

The $1.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) increase in gas prices 
since the beginning of May has already driven responses among end users. 
First, gas is now pricing at a slight premium to residual fuel oil on the 
East Coast, and gas will likely lose approximately 600 million cubic feet 
(MMcf) per day of demand to residual fuel oil this summer relative to last 
summer. Second, several ammonia manufacturing facilities have begun to shut 
down. Equally telling, however, is that heat in any one region of the 
country-most recently the West-is all that is required to sustain gas prices 
above $4.00 at the Henry Hub, despite relatively moderate temperatures 
elsewhere and demand reductions in industrial and other power markets. 
Underlying pressures are such that prices are likely to rise on average from 
current levels as higher temperatures arrive. For these reasons CERA expects 
prices to average $4.45 at the Henry Hub during July (see Table 1), and even 
greater volatility is !
possible. The intense competition and need to price out end-use demand mean 
that the market is vulnerable to spikes above $5.00 per MMBtu amid heat waves 
this summer.

Gas Storage-Injections Increase, but Little Relief Yet

The gas market experienced a small measure of relief in early June as storage 
injections finally reached a pace closer to historical averages, with the 
American Gas Association (AGA) reporting 78 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of 
injections during each of the weeks ending June 2 and 9. However, these 
injections did little to reduce a deficit that is now close to 400 Bcf on a 
year-over-year basis, and conditions may not again be as favorable as they 
have been recently for injections for many weeks, or even months, to come. As 
temperatures rise through the end of the month, injections are likely to 
slow, so that for June CERA expects an average injection rate of 
approximately 10 Bcf per day. The deficit that stood at an estimated 394 Bcf 
as of the end of May (see Table 2), on an inventory level of approximately 
1,454 Bcf, is expected to rise slightly during June, to 403 Bcf, despite a 
healthy injection rate for the first nine days of the month.

With US wellhead supply still running an estimated 0.5 to 1.0 Bcf per day 
below year-earlier levels and with added imports from Canada just offsetting 
this decline, even the moderate demand growth expected for July relative to 
last July will make reducing the deficit a difficult task. Each month in 
which this 400 Bcf deficit carries forward increases the likelihood that 
inventories will be at their lowest maximum ever this October. Injections 
like those in the recent two weeks would have to continue into July for this 
pattern to reverse in a significant way, an unlikely event that would occur 
only under very mild weather conditions.

Regional Markets

With the exception of the Rocky Mountains, western differentials have been 
supported by waves of hot weather and extremely strong gas demand for power 
generation within the region. This strong demand is pulling supplies from the 
Permian and San Juan Basins to the West Coast and has pushed up capacity 
utilization on the Southwest pipelines into California. Prices at the 
California border have been particularly strong, averaging over a $0.30 
premium to the Henry Hub so far this month. Continued strong western demand 
looks likely to support prices within the region through July, as power loads 
remain strong and hydroelectric output declines. In addition, the early heat 
waves have begun to erode the California storage surplus, although 
inventories in the region as a whole remain strong (see Table 3).

CERA's outlook by region follows:

*  Rockies. Continuing strong supply growth and low seasonal demand have 
pushed up exports out of the Rocky Mountains region. High utilization rates 
on export pipelines will keep Rocky Mountain differentials wide during the 
rest of the summer. CERA expects an average July differential to the Henry 
Hub of $0.55 per MMBtu.

*  San Juan. The pull on supplies from California has narrowed the 
differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub, and this West 
Coast pull looks likely to remain strong through the summer. CERA expects a 
differential between the San Juan Basin and the Henry Hub of $0.16 per MMBtu 
during July.

*  Permian and Mid-Continent. As Texas power loads increase, the competition 
from the West Coast and Texas markets for Permian supplies should intensify. 
Permian differentials, which have been averaging around $0.15 per MMBtu to 
the Henry Hub, should narrow. CERA expects a $0.06 per MMBtu differential for 
July. Mid-Continent supplies should price just below Permian supplies, at an 
$0.08 per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub.

*  Chicago. Chicago differentials continue to trade around $0.05 per MMBtu to 
the Henry Hub, and although hot weather and climbing demand within the region 
could put some upward pressure on those differentials, ample seasonal 
pipeline capacity into the region will limit pressure. CERA expects a July 
differential of $0.06 per MMBtu.

*  Northeast. New York citygate differentials have a higher floor this 
summer, namely higher fuel costs from the Gulf Coast as a result of $4.00 
gas. The result has been differentials above $0.30 from Transco Station 65 
but closer to $0.30 from the Henry Hub. As power generation load reaches its 
peak, however, differentials can rise even in summer. Short-lived power load 
peaks may lift weekly New York differentials into the $0.40s, but for the 
month of July CERA expects the New York differential to average $0.34.

Canadian Markets-Demand
Still Down

Canadian demand continues to be down on a year-over-year basis. Volumes on 
TransCanada Pipeline are 400 MMcf below levels at this time last year, and 
Alberta demand is 200 MMcf below; both of these reductions are primarily 
storage related. Weak storage injections, driven in large part by the lack of 
an adequate summer-winter price spread, continue to place inventories further 
behind 1999 levels. Although inventories are still well above the five-year 
average, unless injections increase, it is more likely that end-of-season 
inventories will be comparable to the five-year average (450 Bcf) rather than 
to 1999 levels (484 Bcf).

Export volumes continue to be slightly higher than last year. Thus far in 
June, flows on Northern Border Pipeline are similar to 1999, while PG&E GT-NW 
is currently operating 300 MMcf higher. Demand on the West Coast is expected 
to continue this trend for the summer.

Alberta supply build for June is likely to be flat with 1999 levels. An 
outage pattern similar to last year's has emerged. TCE/NOVA has had 
maintenance projects ongoing in June, but the supply reduction is primarily 
the result of plant turnarounds. Thus far in June, reductions in supply 
because of maintenance have been as high as 850 MMcf but should average 300 
MMcf for the month. Even though June is expected to be flat year-over-year, 
the fact that this maintenance reduction is less than 1999 maintenance 
reductions implies that a return to supply growth has not yet occurred. 
Supply is still expected to start showing growth in the second half of the 
year, largely in the fourth quarter, as a result of the increased level of 
drilling. The annual average supply is expected to be around 100 MMcf per day 
higher than in 1999 as the result of the return to growth in Alberta and 
modest growth in British Columbia (again primarily later in the year), as 
well as the new production from!
 Ft. Liard that is now onstream.

The NYMEX and Henry Hub price strength is being felt in Canada. AECO is 
expected to average C$5.15 per gigajoule (GJ) (US$3.69 per MMBtu) for June 
with a differential in the low US$0.60s. July is expected to average C$5.44 
per GJ (US$3.90 per MMBtu). The Henry-to-AECO differential is likely to 
remain relatively high until storage injections increase the demand.

Note:  The market reaction is interesting.  One can surmise that quite a bit 
of the gas that was contracted for on Vector is 
firm utility gas.  The run up in Chicago may be temporary until alternate 
arrangements are completed.

Vector Delay Confirms Market's Suspicions

Future shippers on the new Chicago-to-Dawn Vector Pipeline had their fears 
confirmed Tuesday when pipeline officials announced that the start-up date 
for the project, which was scheduled for Nov. 1 to coincide with the start-up 
of the long-awaited Alliance Pipeline, would be delayed until Dec. 1. 

Vector officials blamed the delay on the excessive rainfall that has hampered 
construction of the pipeline, which --- when completed --- would provide 
initial takeaway for about 700 MMcf/d of the 1.3 Bcf/d of western Canadian 
gas that will be shipped to the Chicago market by Alliance. Alliance is due 
to begin operations on Oct. 31. 

The announcement yesterday left many in the market asking the million-dollar 
question: "where will that [Alliance] gas go?" in the meantime. Alliance 
officials noted the line has connections with existing pipelines and LDCs 
serving the Chicago hub that could pick up the slack between Oct. 31 and Dec. 
1. 

Alliance's Jack Crawford downplayed the impact of the Vector start-up delay 
on Alliance. "We don't think [there will be] much effect at all. We have been 
working closely with Vector. Our connection with them, if it's not ready, is 
very close. We also have five other connections with other [existing] 
pipelines and LDCs" in Chicago. Many shippers "understand [that with ] a 
startup the magnitude of ours [Alliance] and Vector's, there are likely to be 
some bumps at beginning." 

Immediate market reaction to the news was somewhat unexpected. The Chicago 
basis for November widened from a plus 9.5-10 to plus 11-12 Tuesday following 
Vector's announcement. That is contradictory to what you would think would 
occur, said a Chicago trader for a large marketing company. "I was offering 
index-plus gas today betting on the chance that will come off by the time 
bidweek rolls around," he said. The effect on the market wasn't as profound 
as some would have thought, agreed another trader. "In fact, Chicago prices 
actually strengthened on the news. You would think that with the excess gas 
on the market starting Nov 1, the basis would have come off. The only thing I 
can think is that people are betting on cold weather showing up in the 
Chicago market on Nov. 1 as well." 

Meanwhile Dawn prices, which one would have expected to strengthen following 
the news, did so, as November basis widened from low 30s to plus 36 yesterday 
following the announcement, a Michigan trader said. 

The Vector Pipeline would transport much of the Alliance gas from the market 
hub in Chicago to the hub at Dawn, ON, as well as provide access to markets 
and storage in the upper Midwest. The line eventually will carry 1 Bcf/d, but 
its initial start-up delivery capacity will be 700 MMcf/d. The pipeline is 
slated to serve key markets in Ontario, Quebec, and the U.S. Midwest and 
Northeast. 

~Vector shippers were notified of the delay along with the rest of the market 
Tuesday, although many already had suspected the pipeline wouldn't be able to 
adhere to its scheduled start-up date. At an LDC forum in Chicago a few weeks 
ago, a spokesman for Vector insisted the pipeline was on schedule, but then 
sources said he showed pictures of parts of the pipeline underwater. "Folks 
who were there knew what that meant." 

Presently, more than 90% of the Vector line has been installed and progress 
on the Springville compressor station is on schedule, according to the 
company. The Dec. 1 start-up date includes adequate time for any further 
weather impacts and for the extensive commissioning and testing programs 
necessary, it said, adding Vector is scheduled to begin filling the system in 
late October to complete the commissioning of facilities. 

Sponsors of Vector include Calgary-based Enbridge Inc. with a 45% interest; 
Westcoast Energy Inc. of Vancouver, BC, with a 30% interest; and 
Detroit-based MCN Energy Group Inc. with a 25% interest.

Title: One Tight Winter Peak Remains 	

***********************************************************************

WESTERN ENERGY--WINTER DEMAND PEAKS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PRICE SPIKES OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS

Building natural gas and power supplies are providing a cushion for the western 
energy markets for this winter. Although seasonal gas and power demand spikes 
will again push prices higher, this winter will not look like the winter of 
2000/01. Unlike during the record high gas and power prices and blackouts last 
year winter, reduced demand, increased gas storage levels, and new gas and 
power supplies will significantly temper prices and significantly reduce the 
risk of supply disruptions. 

*  A supply build of 300 million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the Rockies and 
900 MMcf in western Canada is meeting with declining demand in the West

*  Fourth quarter power demand is expected to be 13 percent below levels last 
year, while over 5,000 megawatts of new supply has been added this year

*  Only severe cold weather, prolonged drought, or a supply disruption could 
produce a reliability problem this winter

Summary:
The recently concluded 12th Session of the Subsidiary Bodies in Bonn, the 
next-to-last negotiating session before the details of the Kyoto Protocol are 
scheduled to be finalized in November, made little progress on key issues. 
But the meetings did serve to highlight divisions within the three 
negotiating blocks and identify the most contentious areas for future 
discussion.

Summary:
The retail energy industry and the Internet are becoming increasingly 
interlinked. The past 12 months have seen the formation of a wave of new 
retail energy businesses seeking ways to utilize the Internet to create a 
"new" retail energy industry. The difference is that this "new" industry will 
invert the energy supply chain and be built from the demand side (customer 
end) back upstream. This fosters a new role for customers and their 
relationship with suppliers, an expansion in the number and types of products 
and services being offered, and a change in the composition of the companies 
involved in this segment. In this Private Report we analyze these new 
entrants, their business models, and the prospects for success in what to 
date has been a difficult marketplace.

Summary:
The last remaining obstacle to the Blue Stream gas pipeline project between 
Russia and Turkey appears about to be cleared away. Over the past two days 
the Turkish parliament has been debating a key tax protocol connected to the 
project. CERA believes the measure is very close to passage, as the Turkish 
governing coalition has successfully resolved its internal differences over 
Blue Stream.

Summary:
The proposed directive on renewables issued by the European Commission on May 
10 may appear to be a weak compromise between widely divergent interests. 
Rather, CERA sees the proposal as a potentially important building block for 
a competitive market in renewable energy sources; the establishment of a 
method for guaranteeing a renewable origin for energy lays the foundation for 
green energy markets in the medium term.

Summary:
Colombia is expected to begin an economic recovery in 2000 after a 
contraction of over 5 percent in 1999. Despite this expansion, unemployment 
levels will remain stable at 19 percent, and losses incurred by companies, by 
individuals, and by the government through lower tax revenues during the last 
nine quarters of negative economic growth will not be recovered this year. 
The administration of Andr,s Pastrana Arango faces the difficult challenge of 
getting the economy back in shape at a time when his popularity is waning.

Summary:
The opening of Brazil's upstream oil sector has taken another step forward 
this week following the successful ANP auction of 21 blocks. This bidding 
round comes one year after ANP's first round, held in June 1999. The bid was 
well subscribed by 44 companies that were qualified to participate and bid 
for the 10 onshore and 13 offshore blocks throughout nine basins in Brazil. 
Although the ANP collected lower participation fees than in the first round 
(US$9.0 million compared with US$9.8 million in the first round), the second 
round was generally considered a success.

Title: Brazilian Power Markets: Demand Recovery Gathers Steam but Supply 
Questions Remain
Author: Bailey, Mattos
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Latin American Energy
URL:
http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/la/alt/061600_17/la_alt_061600_17_ab.html

Summary:
Brazil's power demand grew rapidly throughout the first quarter of 2000. 
February demand was 6.8 percent over February 1999 levels, and March demand 
grew a further 7.6 percent above the previous year. The industrial sector 
continued to lead the recovery with year-to-date demand growing 9.8 percent 
over 1999, and commercial sector demand growth remained strong at 7.5 percent 
over a similar period. As demand growth strengthened, hydro power generation 
increased while thermal generation levels declined steadily from a peak in 
January. Hydro stored energy levels had begun to decline in all regions by 
the end of April, signaling the end of the wet season. With rapidly 
increasing demand, particularly in the South and Southeast regions, Brazil 
could experience power shortages during the coming dry season if capacity 
additions that are currently scheduled to come online in the next several 
months are delayed.

Summary:
For the first time in many decades, the presidential and parliamentary 
campaigns are highly competitive, and the results of these democratically 
conducted elections will have a large impact on the effectiveness and future 
of the new administration. However, the real political battle begins after 
the elections. Indeed, the winning party will have to exercise all its 
political skills to create coalitions and advance negotiations in order to 
take control of the government. Three different scenarios are portrayed in 
this CERA Decision Brief.

Summary:
July 2000 marks the second anniversary of the widely publicized visit of then 
President-elect Andres Pastrana to elderly guerilla chief of the Armed 
Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (FARC), Manuel Marulanda. Two years later, 
the country is no closer to peace, and resolution of the ongoing negotiations 
is uncertain at best. This prolongation and stagnation of the peace process 
has had a direct negative impact on energy sector investment in Colombia. The 
government will likely proceed with formal negotiations, but time--and 
Pastrana's remaining term in office--is running out.

Product Line: Latin American Energy
URL:
http://www.cera.com/client/la/alt/063000_16/la_alt_063000_16_ab.html

Summary:
Prices in the Argentine power market were significantly higher in May owing 
to the combination of continued low hydro output, strong demand growth, and 
periodic constraints on natural gas deliveries to power plants in the Buenos 
Aires region. Spot power prices (energy component only) averaged $18.24 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) in May. Although average power prices declined from last 
year, price volatility increased, with several short-duration episodes of 
prices over $60 per MWh as gas unavailability in the Buenos Aires region 
forced several midcost units offline during peak hours. In June, prices are 
expected to continue strengthening to the $24-$28 per MWh range on average. 
Beyond June, price pressures are expected to remain negative as increasing 
hydro output, new and returning low-cost thermal capacity, and the end of gas 
constraints push average prices back toward $15 per MWh or below by August or 
September.

Summary:
The US gas market enters the month of June with prices at the highest level 
since deregulation. At the Henry Hub prices have surged to as high as $4.50 
per MMBtu--up from less than $3.00 per MMBtu during April. Behind this has 
been a building and serious shortfall of supply, the result of disappointing 
gas production levels and surging gas demand for power generation. The gap 
between these two forces has been met through storage inventories, with 
injections so far this spring running between 1.5 and 2.0 Bcf per day below 
last year's rate. The continued tension between these two forces will keep 
the pressure on prices this summer, and the need to inject gas into storage 
will price out increments of demand.

URL:
http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/alt/061500_16/nag_alt_061500_16_ab.html

Summary:
Pressure remains extremely strong in the United States gas market as three 
factors--the increasing power generation demand, lower storage inventories, 
and US wellhead supply still struggling to rebound--call into question the 
ability to build storage to a level adequate for next winter. Prices are 
being supported also by concurrent strength in oil and liquids markets, 
making traditional alternatives to gas much more expensive than in recent 
years. In this environment intense competition between power generation 
demand and storage injections will continue throughout the summer--with 
pressure increasing into July as temperatures rise--with the result that gas 
will continue to price at the high levels necessary to discourage end-use 
demand. CERA expects a July average price of $4.45 per MMBtu.

Title: Western Canada Supply Growth: Getting Nowhere Faster

E-Mail Category: Decision Brief
Product Line: North American Gas
URL:
http://www.cera.com/client/nag/db/061500_18/nag_db_061500_18_ab.html

Summary:
As US supply declines and demand grows, current high gas prices are 
reinforced, but western Canadian gas supply growth appears to be faltering 
when it is needed most. Both transitory factors and enduring trends underlie 
the disappointing production growth results. The largely weather-related 
transitory factors have had a near-term impact on drilling and connection 
activity. The underlying trends have been developing slowly over time. More 
shallow gas wells have been drilled in the past three to four years and 
created a shift to higher average basin declines and lower average per well 
production rates. Thus more shallow wells are needed just to replace 
production. With a shift to more exploration and deeper drilling, higher 
supply growth rates are possible, but if that does not occur, other potential 
supply sources may step in. Significant Arctic reserves in the McKenzie Delta 
and the Alaskan North Slope are once again entering the spotlight. Coal bed 
methane has become a str!
ong source of US supply. Although now ignored in Canada, it may become a 
future source of Canadian gas.

http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nag/wch/061600_11/nag_wch_061600_11_ab.html

Summary:
Fundamentals have taken center stage, as building demand pressure accompanies 
US supply declines. Storage inventories have been significantly reduced, and 
the pressure for storage injections is likely to intensify as we head into 
the summer months. Demand-driven growth continues, as completions of 
gas-fired power generation plants accelerate to a pace above 10,000 megawatts 
per year and economic growth stimulates electricity demand. The result is a 
higher-price playing field for natural gas, with the average Henry Hub price 
likely to reach $3.67 per MMBtu for 2000--its highest level since the 
development of spot markets.

Title: Closing the Utility Stock Valuation Gap: Does Strategy Matter?

Product Line: North American Power

http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/pr/062000_14/nap_pr_062000_14_ab.html

Summary:
The stock market has been delivering an unsettling message to the utility 
industry. Traditionally undervalued in the market, the sector is trading at a 
historically wide 50 percent discount to Standard and Poor's S&P 500. The S&P 
Utility Index over the past 18 months gained only 5 percent, with huge gains 
by some energy companies offset by a 15 percent drop in stock price for 29 
electric utilities. Yet early this year, the SPU outpaced all other industry 
groups. How should constantly evolving utilities in this wide-open sector 
form a strategic plan to maximize shareholder value while achieving success? 
The value of electric utility merger and acquisition deals for 1999--a record 
$50 billion--was double the 1998 value. But are these choices ahead of the 
curve? And when will the market catch up? Three groups of new companies with 
distinctive strategies may provide clues to the new strategic landscape: 
multiservice and technology providers, superregionals, and global power and !
energy companies. Three other strategic choices are considered in evaluating 
responses to these challenges.

Price Volatility

http://WWW.CERA.COM/client/nap/db/062200_18/nap_db_062200_18_ab.html

Summary:
While several regional power markets are likely to see a repeat of price 
spikes this summer, other markets are likely to see a reversal in price 
volatility as supply-demand balances improve dramatically. One way to 
interpret forward markets is as a consensus of market expectations. 
Therefore, forward prices for on-peak wholesale power reflect the common 
expectation that prices will spike as high as--or even higher than--in 1999. 
A significant disconnect exists between the forward market prices and market 
fundamentals for the upcoming summer in some regional markets.

Summary:
Spurred by supply concerns at the start of the summer driving season, spot 
gasoline-to-crude oil price differentials on both sides of the north Atlantic 
have soared to the highest levels seen since the Gulf War. In CERA's view, 
this strength in margins is attributable to the convergence of three factors: 
very low inventories, tightening gasoline specifications, and legal 
uncertainty.

Summary:
The US gasoline market exhibited exceptional strength during May. US Gulf 
Coast unleaded gasoline surged to $8.40 per barrel measured against WTI, up 
$3.58 per barrel over the strong April value of $4.82. Apparent demand for 
gasoline skyrocketed to 8.64 million barrels per day (mbd) in response to the 
start of the summer driving season. Despite increases in the reported demand 
for distillate and jet/kerosene, these markets did not experience the same 
month-over-month strength in differentials, dropping to $1.58 and $2.58 per 
barrel versus WTI, respectively.

Summary:
As higher crude oil prices started to reduce the high product differentials 
to Brent and thus lower refinery margins, refiners attempted to prevent this 
situation from worsening by reducing throughputs. However, very tight markets 
for gasoline and to a lesser extent for automotive diesel helped to limit the 
fall in those products' values. Meanwhile, fuel oil discounts to crude oil 
widened in May, driving down simple/hydroskimming margins.

In recent weeks, the combination of lower primary products inventories and 
reductions in operations at some refineries has helped differentials to 
recover. This has pushed margins to above May's averages, although still 
below April's peaks.

Title: Recent Actions Signal Progress Toward MTBE Elimination

Summary:
The close scrutiny that federal reformulated gasoline (RFG) now faces from 
the media and public officials owing to Midwestern market price spikes has 
not stopped the inexorable political progress toward eliminating methyl 
tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) use in the US gasoline pool. Additional 
signposts, including heightened congressional debate over legislation 
eliminating MTBE use and state actions to ban MTBE, continue to emerge that 
point the way toward MTBE-free gasoline in the United States.

Summary:
Refined products markets continue to display marked regional differences. In 
the Atlantic Basin, low gasoline inventories in both the United States and 
Europe, which resulted from many months of OPEC production restraint, 
continue to dominate the market, and gasoline differentials above crude are 
at their highest level in over ten years. Although signs are emerging of a 
possible correction in the North American market in the coming month, the 
2000 gasoline season will almost certainly be the strongest experienced by 
Atlantic Basin refiners in many years. In contrast, Asia Pacific spot 
refining margins were weak through most of June, until the recent accident at 
KPC's Mina al-Ahmadhi refinery prompted a quick strengthening in prompt 
Singapore margins. However, with ample unused refining capacity available 
east of Suez and the likelihood of a partial restart of the KPC refinery in 
July, CERA's outlook is for that strength to be of short duration.

Title: New Peaks, New Prices

Summary:
In the West, July typically marks the start of the summer cooling season and 
steadily rising power prices. CERA expect the West to be the only region in 
North America with a year-over-year increase in peak electricity demand. 
Power prices already established new record highs in June, suggesting that as 
demand reaches its peak in the coming months western power markets will 
continue to experience increased volatility compared with last year's levels. 
The convergence of higher gas prices, growing power demand, and reduced 
hydroelectric energy production compared with 1999 levels is pushing up 
western power prices. Greater utilization of gas-fired generators within the 
West has supported western differentials and contributed to high gas prices 
throughout North America. Western gas prices should continue to be strong, 
boosted by continuing increases in regional gas demand for power generation 
and pressure across North America to inject gas into storage in anticipation 
of summer !
power loads.

Summary:
Driven by strong demand--especially in the recovering Asian economies and the 
United States--oil prices (both WTI and Brent) have again broken the $30 
level--a mark that is of particular significance in this US election year. In 
turn, the oil market's attention is again fixed on OPEC, as it prepares for 
its June 21 meeting, but its members are deeply divided over how to respond.

Summary:
The key ingredient in the volatile oil market is the new OPEC--and its 
successful implementation of a strategy to keep supply one half step behind 
demand-driving inventories down for crude, with the side effect of lowering 
stocks for several products in markets such as the United States and Europe. 
Three features of the current oil market are supporting prices:
* Market supported
* Psychology enhanced
* OPEC driven

Summary:
OPEC's agreement to raise its production quota beginning July 1 by 708,000 
barrels per day to 25.4 million barrels per day is consistent with its 
strategy of restraining supply to maintain oil inventories at relatively low 
levels. The gain in supply is a short-term fix meant to alleviate political 
pressure for increased production and to push prices below $30 but keep them 
in a mid- to upper $20s range.

Note:  Williams does not give the amount of volume response they received in 
their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their
established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are 
naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market
for the project.

Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews

After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the 
Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding 
open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the 
project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent 
region. 

"We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western 
Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a 
cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the 
mid-continent," said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and 
rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems. 

The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d 
from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central 
system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline. 

The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern 
Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams 
believes this project would be able to supply a "seamless transport at an 
incremental cost" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central 
system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access 
storage including directly owned and third party storage fields. 

Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20 
cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected 
to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the 
construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP.

AGA Confirms Plans to Continue Storage Survey Until May 
The American Gas Association (AGA) confirmed that it will continue its weekly storage report until May 1 following requests by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  In October, the association announced plans to discontinue the report on Jan. 2 because it drained resources committed to other programs more beneficial to AGA members. Subsequent to that announcement, the Energy Information Administration announced plans to begin its own weekly survey of natural gas storage levels, but the EIA said it could not have its survey system operational by Jan. 2. EIA requested that AGA continue its survey to avoid a lapse in information during the winter heating season. 
AGA said it intends to meet that request, but continued publication is contingent on the availability of AGA resources, continued voluntary reporting by the reporting storage operators and the timing of the EIA survey under development.

Title: Power Market Caps: Lower Prices at Higher Risk?
Author: Zenker, Mortizburke
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: Western Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5526&m=1264 ,

Recent events in California, culminating in new market rules established for 
the energy and ancillary services markets, indicate that legislators and 
regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the markets they 
established. The hot weather in California during June triggered high 
electricity demand, corresponding record-breaking power prices, and rolling 
blackouts in the San Francisco area. Although the economic impact of both the 
outages and the concurrent price spikes is significant, a recent decision by 
California's Independent System Operator (ISO) to intervene in the markets by 
lowering price caps through the summer of 2000 from $750 to $500 per 
megawatt-hour (MWh) may prove to be the most important product of the market 
events.* Ironically, the proclivity to continue to change the market rules, 
whatever the intention, could create market distortions that delay the 
addition of new generating capacity by discouraging plant developers and 
driving away needed capit!
al. This would only prolong the state's supply shortage and resultant high 
prices.

Although the record-setting weather that prompted the rolling blackouts in 
the San Francisco area is not likely to be repeated, the West as a whole will 
experience higher coincident peak demand under normal weather conditions this 
summer. CERA expects that supplies will be sufficient to meet peak demand 
this year, but the high price levels of June will be repeated during peak 
demand conditions not only this summer but during the summers of 2001 and 
possibly 2002.

The Pressure Builds
The blackouts were not spawned by a statewide supply shortfall, but instead 
by a transmission constraint that limits the ability to import sufficient 
quantities of power to the San Francisco area. The quantity of generating 
capacity out of service in the West was near average levels, despite a 
nuclear unit outage in Washington. Although the blackouts were brief and 
wholesale power prices decreased with the temperatures, the intense scrutiny 
over the events and resultant changes to the market rules indicate that 
legislators and regulators are dissatisfied with the performance of the 
markets they designed. The market's architects assumed that competition would 
lower wholesale prices in the state. However, prices in June have been 
roughly eight times higher than in 1997's prerestructured California market, 
leading many regulators and legislators to conclude that the markets are 
flawed, requiring additional caps and market rules. Although some state 
officials strongly favored lo!
wering the price caps, many within the ISO's Board of Governors strongly 
opposed intervening in what they consider to be normal market reactions to 
tight supply and demand fundamentals.

The current tight supply situation in California and the West as a whole is a 
product of recent strong economic growth throughout the region coupled with 
the slow process of permitting new power plants. Owing to strong economic 
growth in California in 1998 and 1999 (5.2 and 5.5 percent, respectively*), 
capacity margins have shrunk from 12 percent in 1997 to 7 percent in 2000. 
Demand growth throughout the West has reduced the amount of energy available 
for export from the Pacific Northwest and Southwest to California.

As a result, even with optimistic levels of energy imports and the 
curtailment of approximately 2,800 megawatts (MW) of interruptible load 
within the state, California capacity margins will fall well below North 
American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) reliability criteria (roughly 15 
percent) this summer. The West is the only region in North America that will 
experience a tightening of capacity margins relative to levels in 1999 under 
normal weather conditions. CERA anticipates peak demand growth to continue to 
outpace new capacity additions through 2001, with slightly growing capacity 
margins in 2002. At these levels, an unusual amount of either plant capacity 
or transmission line capacity out of service during peak demand conditions 
would require the ISO to mandate blackouts of a portion of the state's load 
to maintain the overall stability of the grid.

Thus, the tight capacity situation in the state will continue to pressure 
prices to high levels, which may provoke legislators and regulators to 
attempt to extend the price caps or implement additional market rules.

Market Distorting Effects
Under tremendous pressure from some legislators, regulators, and market 
participants, the California ISO Board of Governors lowered the current price 
caps on energy from $750 to $500 per MWh in a special meeting conducted June 
28.** Owing to the interconnectedness of western markets, the decision to 
lower the caps and the apparent willingness of regulators to continue to 
change the rules governing California's electricity markets will affect power 
market participants throughout the West.

* Profitability of existing and future generators degraded. High power prices 
and volatility levels in June, although detrimental to most buyers, provide 
strong encouragement to plant developers. Limiting the level of price fly-ups 
degrades the ability of plant owners to recover capital costs plus earn a 
return on that capital. In most periods of the year, competition drives 
prices to levels that provide little opportunity for a return on capital. 
Generators therefore seek to recover their investments with higher bids in 
California's energy and ancillary services markets during periods of supply 
scarcity. Existing merchant generators are at increased risk to recover the 
investments they made based on cash flow outlooks developed prior to the 
imposition of caps.

* Supply shortfall prolonged. The process of siting and permitting power 
plants in California is cumbersome, requiring as long as five years from 
plant proposal to synchronization with the grid. The California Energy 
Commission (CEC), the state agency charged with approving new plants, has 
repeatedly expressed concerns about the chronic tight supply situation in the 
state. Price-dampening market intervention indicates to plant developers that 
California officials may continue to reengineer the state's power markets to 
the detriment of generator profitability and, when added to the difficult 
permitting process, potentially delaying the introduction of new capacity to 
meet rapidly growing state demand. Prominent plant developers have recently 
indicated that markets outside of California may provide a more stable market 
and a better environment for deploying scarce resources and generating 
equipment such as turbines.

* Trading positions affected. Lowering price caps reduces the degree of price 
volatility and the level of overall average prices. Market participants have 
executed market positions based on the outlook for prices under the previous, 
higher price cap. By lowering the price cap, not only are the value of 
existing physical (e.g., power plant) and financial (e.g., forward contracts) 
positions significantly affected, but market participants must also 
incorporate the uncertainty of possible future adjustments to the cap into 
their trading.*

* Circumventing market rules. The variety of energy and capacity markets in 
California, as well as the bilateral markets outside of the state, provides 
opportunities to circumvent the intent of the new market rules, further 
distorting the markets in the West.

Although lowering price caps in California will likely temporarily reduce 
price levels, the new power plant capacity ultimately needed in the state to 
reduce price levels and improve reliability on a sustainable basis could be 
discouraged by prolonged and repeated intervention in the market.

Breaking News: CA Governor Declares State of Emergency 
posted 2:37 AM (CST) Jan 18, 2001 
Late Wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more 
with electricity supplies drying up throughout the West, California Gov. Gray 
Davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed 
the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the 
beleaguered state grid. In making the bold move, Gov. Davis also announced 
that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has 
reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5%. 
In the emergency proclamation, the governor said that electricity presently 
available through California three major investor-owned utilities is 
"insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric 
service," and thus, he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources 
to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage. Then he went on to 
specifically empower the water resources agency, which has been a key player 
in helping the state's transmission grid operator (Cal-ISO) narrowly avoid 
blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state. 
Noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on 
target for a 200 MW reduction and the water resources department peak pumping 
load has been reduced by 450 MW, Gov. Davis lauded Californians for having 
"stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for 
electricity," noting that the state already is 47th in the nation among the 
lowest per-capita energy use and the state's electricity prices are the 10th 
highest in the nation.

Duke Stands By California Market

In the midst of much uncertainty surrounding California's power situation, 
Duke Energy North America Monday reiterated its commitment to the state's 
struggling wholesale electricity market, announcing new bilateral power deals 
with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and progress with redevelopment plans at 
three coastal power plant sites it is operating. 

"Duke is committed to continue playing a major role to help California 
address its electricity shortfall and the high prices many felt this summer," 
said Bill Hall, Duke's vice president for the western region in North 
America, noting that brownfield projects in California have turned out to be 
more difficult than new plants to site, based on Duke's experience over the 
last three years. 

In response to questions, Hall acknowledged that Duke is constantly 
reassessing its position in California and a return by the state energy 
officials to a cost-based regulated market would cause him a lot of concern, 
but he is confident at this point that for the long-term market solutions 
will be applied. He said in his meetings with state political and regulatory 
leaders he is convinced they know the state can't turn back to a traditional 
command-and-control regulatory structure and they recognize that "multiple 
solutions" are needed, including balancing supply/demand for power. 

"We believe that new generation coming on line throughout the West in the 
next few years will lessen the market volatility and markets will begin to 
react based on supply/demand stability," Hall said. 

Both Hall's and Duke's western trading executive, Nancy DeSchane, said they 
are very anxious to see what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
releases Wednesday with its initial draft decision on what it will do to 
address California wholesale electricity prices, including whether it intends 
to extend the California Independent System Operator's (Cal-ISO's) authority 
to impose price caps. 

Hall said Duke has signed a series of "substantial long-term wholesale 
electricity contracts" with PG&E's utility that will "help stabilize the 
price volatility for the distributor's retail customers." He would not 
disclose the terms of the deal, including the volumes and duration, but said 
the supplies are slated to be received in the state's northern zone (NP-15). 
Earlier Duke offered California utilities five-year deals at $50/MWh. Duke's 
Salt Lake City-based trading arm is doing the deal, rather than its 
California-based generation plants, meaning the power could come from sources 
inside or outside of the state. 

Hall said Duke has begun work with local city officials in the San Diego 
suburb of Chula Vista to accelerate the current schedule for replacing the 
South Bay Power Plant, which Duke leases with an option to buy. "We hope 
within the next year we'll be able to announce what we can do to expedite the 
replacement of this facility," he said. 

Following approvals from the state and a local water permit last week, Duke 
will begin its $500 million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant along 
the north central coast "within the next 30 to 60 days," Hall said. The 
upgrade will add 1,060 MW to the site's current 1,500-MW capacity and will 
require a 30-40% increase in the plant's natural gas requirements, which 
PG&E's gas utility assures can be handled by the existing pipeline 
infrastructure. 

"We've had discussions with PG&E, and we're obviously concerned that we have 
sufficient infrastructure to transport gas that we purchase into the system," 
Hall said. "We're confident that their infrastructure can support Moss," 
although, he added, that statewide "we certainly have concerns about the gas 
infrastructure" and Duke is working with state officials to assure there are 
adequate gas supplies. 

"We had some problems this summer in Southern California, and San Diego Gas 
and Electric recently announced it is going to begin an intense look at what 
needs to be done to upgrade its (gas pipeline) infrastructure to support the 
new generation plants coming on board." 

Salt Lake City-based DeSchane said Duke has a "balanced" portfolio of supply 
and storage contracts, noting that she thinks her company has a "very strong 
physical position in the West for gas," and the trading unit will be working 
over the next couple of years "to assure that the gas position is sustained 
and continues to grow." 

Down the central coast about 80 miles at Morro Bay, Duke has resubmitted 
revised plans for totally replacing the 1950s-era power plant in a renovation 
that will build a new $600 million 1,200-MW plant. With prompt state 
approvals, Hall said Duke could bring the new plant online by the summer of 
2003 and demolish the existing (1,000-MW) plant by 2007, adding that PG&E 
cannot deliver additional gas supplies so the added output is a product of 
the anticipated improved efficiency of the new plant.

Initial ALJ Decision in Transwestern Case Delayed 
FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. has extended by two weeks the deadline for an initial decision in the case in which Transwestern Pipeline is alleged to have arranged more lucrative negotiated-rate deals last winter prior to posting available firm transportation capacity to its web site -- a move that extracted higher rates and limited the capacity availability for recourse-rate shippers for service to California. 
Due to "scheduling conflicts," Wagner pushed back the deadline for president ALJ Jacob Leventhal to issue a decision to Oct. 30 from Oct. 15. 
FERC ordered the hearing in late July to determine whether Transwestern exercised market power in arranging negotiated-rate contracts for capacity that led to some shippers being charged up to $27/MMBtu in February, which the Commission estimated was "70 times the recourse rate."

FERC Gives High Sign to WI Pipe Competition

      The northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin gas transportation 
markets, which long have been dominated by
      ANR Pipeline, moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline-on-pipeline 
competition yesterday when FERC awarded
      the proposed Guardian Pipeline LLC a favorable preliminary 
determination on non-environmental issues. 

      The decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline 
because not only did it shoot down most of the
      arguments presented by ANR to thwart the project, but it found that 
even though the project would "adversely
      affect" landowner interests, Guardian was making "reasonable efforts" 
to mitigate the impact on landowners. 

      Moreover, FERC ruled that while the $224 million pipeline would compete 
head-to-head with ANR, it would not
      have a negative affect on the Coastal pipeline and its customers. "On 
balance, the Commission finds that the
      proposed Guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits 
with minimal adverse impacts," the order said
      [CP00-36]. 

      The Commission also found that sufficient need was established for the 
36-inch, 140-mile pipeline that would
      transport 750,000 Dth/d of gas from the Chicago Hub to markets in 
northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin,
      providing customers there with an alternative to ANR and access to 
competitive Canadian gas supplies. It would
      terminate near Ixonia, WI, where it would interconnect with Wisconsin 
Gas Co.'s distribution system. At the
      Chicago Hub, the pipeline proposes to interconnect to Alliance 
Pipeline, Northern Border Pipeline, Midwestern Gas
      Pipeline and Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America. 

      Guardian has executed 10-year precedent agreements with four shippers 
for 702,500 Dth/d, which equals about
      94% of the project's design capacity. The largest shipper by far will 
be Wisconsin Gas, which has committed itself
      to 650,000 Dth/d of the capacity on the proposed line. In fact, the 
Guardian project is an outgrowth of Wisconsin
      Gas's request for proposals (RFP) process in June 1998, which the LDC 
initiated in anticipation of the expiration of
      its firm transportation contract with ANR in October 2003. The other 
shippers on Guardian include Alliant Energy
      (10,000 Dth/d), WPS Energy Services Inc. (2,500 Dth/d) and an unnamed 
shipper (40,000 Dth/d). The project has a
      targeted in-service date of Nov. 1, 2002. 

      In multiple protests filed at the Commission, ANR argued that 
Guardian's application was "patently deficient"
      because it didn't include the proposed lateral that Wisconsin Gas plans 
to build to interconnect with Guardian.
      Wisconsin Gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to 
build the lateral. Furthermore, ANR claimed
      Wisconsin Gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised LDC serving 
southern Wisconsin to subsidize the
      Guardian project. Wisconsin Gas's parent, WICOR Inc., is one of the 
sponsors of Guardian. The other backers are
      CMS Gas Transmission and Storage and Viking Gas Transmission. 

      But FERC rejected both arguments. "While previous attempts to inject 
competition into ANR's market in this area
      have failed, we believe that this area is ripe for competition, and 
that it is only a matter of time before other
      pipelines submit similar proposals to the Commission. We find that the 
proposed project will provide southeastern
      Wisconsin with access to another source of supply, which will allow 
this market to enjoy the benefits of
      pipeline-to-pipeline competition for the first time," the order noted.

Note:  The EIA says that gas storage levels at the end of December were 10% 
lower than the previous record low set in 1976. 
They have revised their price forecast for 2001 to $5.20 (with the heating 
season at $6.23) and estimate that 2000 will come in 
at $3.70.

EIA Raises Price Forecasts, Confirms Dire Storage Situation

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) again raised its wholesale and 
retail gas price projections for the winter and confirmed that gas storage 
levels at the end of December were lower by 10% than the previous record low 
set in 1976. 

Strong demand during November and December, which the National Weather 
Service has said were the coldest on record, reduced gas stocks to record 
lows for the period, and continued cold should keep storage low and prices 
very high for the remainder of the heating season, EIA said yesterday in its 
Short Term Energy Outlook. 

For the fourth quarter of 2000, gas-weighted heating degree-days were 
estimated to have been up by 28% over last year's relatively mild fourth 
quarter. Gas demand increased 10% over the year prior. Over the entire six 
months of winter (Oct. 1, 2000 to March 31, 2001), EIA projects demand will 
rise by 7% compared to the prior winter, with residential and commercial 
sector demand up by 17% over last winter. 

EIA now expects wellhead prices to average $5.20/Mcf in 2001 compared to an 
estimated $3.70 in 2000 (72% higher than in 1999) and about $4.50 projected 
for 2002. It also raised its projections on retail prices to 70% above winter 
1999-2000 levels. 

The expected 45% increase in the nominal average residential price would be 
the highest season-to-season growth rate since at least 1975." 

Wellhead prices from September through November were more than double the 
price of a year earlier. For the month of December, spot wellhead prices 
averaged "an unheard of $8.36/Mcf. Never have spot gas prices at the wellhead 
been this high for such a sustained period of time," EIA said. "Although high 
oil prices have encouraged the current strength in gas prices, the 
predominant reason for these sustained high gas prices was, and still is, 
uneasiness about the winter supply situation." 

The American Gas Association (AGA) reported last week that working gas levels 
in storage had fallen 209 Bcf during the week ending Dec. 29 to 1,729 Bcf. 
"Translating the AGA data into EIA end-month statistics, we estimate that gas 
stocks were about 780 Bcf below year-ago levels and about 520 Bcf below the 
previous 5-year average," EIA said. "With almost three months of winter still 
to go, falling stocks have raised fears about the domestic supply situation, 
helping to elevate spot and futures prices." 

The AGA made its own announcement yesterday, assuring the public that gas 
supply would be "adequate to meet customers' needs for the remainder of the 
winter heating season. 

"Today, there is more natural gas held in underground storage --- 1.73 Tcf 
--- than has ever been removed from storage during the remainder of any of 
the last five winter heating seasons," said AGA President David Parker. 
Natural gas storage accounts for about 20% of the natural gas consumed during 
the winter heating season, which traditionally runs Nov. 1 - March 31. 

"Rig counts are at record levels and new production will be forthcoming," he 
noted. "But it takes time for new exploration to produce adequate volumes of 
gas to meet increased demand." 

In the meantime, Parker noted, utilities are promoting energy-efficiency 
tips, reminding customers of flexible bill-payment programs and working to 
help low-income individuals. 

EIA expects wellhead prices to remain above $6 for the remainder of the 
heating season, with prices averaging $6.23/Mcf this winter, "more than two 
and one half times the price of last winter." EIA predicts wellhead prices 
during the spring and summer will drop by about $2/Mcf as weather-related 
demand recedes. However, storage injection demand should keep wellhead prices 
above $4 this year. 

Assuming normal weather, EIA expects gas demand to grow by 2.9% in 2001 and 
by 2.7% in 2002, compared with estimated demand growth of 4.5% in 2000. The 
forecast for overall demand growth in 2001 is down considerably from EIA's 
projections last month because higher gas prices have reduced expected 
industrial gas use (up 4% from 2000) more than previously estimated. In 2002, 
the forecast is for even slower growth. However, gas demand from non-utility 
electricity generation in 2001 is now expected to be up by a solid 9%. 
Electric utility gas demand is expected to remain level with consumption 
rates in 2000. 

EIA increased its projections on gas production growth in North America to 
5.4% for this year and 2.5% in 2002. It projects a massive 16% increase in 
gas imports this year and another 4% hike in 2002. "While Canadian export 
capacity may not be fully utilized this winter, we expect net imports to be 
7.8% higher than last winter's imports," EIA said, noting that the 1.325 
Bcf/d Alliance Pipeline began service Dec. 1. EIA also referred to a recent 
report by Canada's National Energy Board that predicts gas deliverability 
from Western Canada will rise by 1.1 Bcf/d by 2002 because of the ongoing 
drilling boom.

El Paso South System Flows 700 MMcf/d

Less than two weeks after the deadly explosion on El Paso Natural Gas' system 
in southeastern New Mexico, the pipeline last week had more than 700 MMcf/d 
of its 1.1 Bcf/d capacity restored to its South Mainline that services 
markets between Texas and California. 

At mid-day Friday, El Paso said it began running about 260 MMcf/d through 
Line 1100 after it received the go-ahead from the federal Office of Pipeline 
Safety (OPS), according to spokeswoman Kim Wallace. El Paso was able to 
re-start partial service on the 26-inch line after it built a 16-inch 
temporary connector line between Line 1110 and Line 1100, which was approved 
by OPS. 

The temporary connector was installed just east of the Pecos River explosion 
site, about 30 miles from Carlsbad, NM. Wallace said Line 1100 would carry 
the gas from Eunice, NM, just Northeast of the Pecos River Compressor 
Station, to the connector with Line 1110, which then would transport it 
westward across the Pecos River Bridge where it would meet up with Line 1100 
further downstream. Meanwhile, Wallace said El Paso submitted to OPS last 
week the test results and a preliminary return-to-service plan for Line 1100. 

Three days prior, the OPS had given El Paso permission to restore service to 
Line 1110 from the Keystone Station through the Pecos River Compressor 
Station at a reduced level. The pipeline re-opened the line at about 400 
MMcf/d, and gradually increased it to 480 MMcf/d by Friday. This is "still 
within the limits it [OPS] set" for Line 1110, Wallace said. 

The OPS restricted El Paso's Line 1110 to 80% of the operating pressure of 
Line 1103 at the time it ruptured, according to Department of Transportation 
spokeswoman Debbie Hinz. She said this put the line at a pressure of about 
538 pounds per square inch. 

The OPS-ordered shutdown of Line 1110 lasted 10 days, during which the agency 
ordered El Paso to conduct extensive hydrostatic, ultrasound and X-ray tests 
to determine its safety, and to submit a plan for restoring service to the 
line. 

As for the future of ruptured Line 1103, Wallace said repairs on it would not 
begin until after the investigation of the explosion is completed, which will 
"probably be nine to 12 months." 

The restoration of service couldn't come soon enough for El Paso customers 
who have been scrambling for transportation capacity ever since federal 
investigators and regulators closed down the three lines that make up El 
Paso's South Main leg in the wake of the blast that killed 11 people and 
critically injured one. California customers have been taking gas out of 
storage to meet their needs during the service interruption. The Department 
of Energy has set up a task force to evaluate the effects of the explosion 
and shutdown on the gas market.

Title: Oil Market Update: New OPEC Faces Steepest Challenge Since 1998 Price Collapse 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2684;


***********************************************************************

WEAK OIL FUNDAMENTALS WEIGHING ON PRICE 

Two forces are vying for control of oil market psychology since September 11--
fear of recession and fear of military action. Currently, the fear of recession 
and its implications for oil demand is in ascendance because military action 
remains in preparatory mode thus far. 

*  An escalation of military action would revive the initial concerns that a US 
military response could affect production in the Middle East.

*  The terrorist attack of September 11 is delivering a shock to the US economy 
with ramifications in the oil market. CERA has revised downward sharply its 
demand outlook in the wake of the attacks.

*  OPEC producers are also growing more concerned about market share. Our 
outlook assumes that OPEC does not agree to a further cut at its September 26 
meeting in Vienna.

 At the CEC meeting today, the Commission did NOT adopt the Draft Final Rep=
ort on Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues in order to give staff additional =
time to review further comments received from SoCal, Edison and others.  In=
 the draft report distributed earlier this month you may recall that the re=
port clearly indicates that the state utilties need to build additional int=
rastate capacity to provide take away capacity from the border and more clo=
sely match current and projected interstate pipeline capacity.  Lad Lorenz =
on behalf of  SoCal spoke at the meeting reiterating their viewpoint that t=
hey currently have sufficient backbone transmission facilities however he o=
ffered that the issue of getting customers to commit to long-term contracts=
 should be added to the report as a basis for increasing capacity.  A spoke=
man for Edison stated that while the report mentions the possibility that m=
arket manipulation may have contributed towards the high gas prices during =
the last heating season, they would like to see the report reflect that mar=
ket manipulation in fact did in part, cause higher prices and he went on to=
 cite the El Paso FERC proceeding as substantiation for this position.  Giv=
en these comments, the adoption of the report was delayed until staff has h=
ad a chance to conduct further analysis.  Most likely it will be on the age=
nda in Sept.
