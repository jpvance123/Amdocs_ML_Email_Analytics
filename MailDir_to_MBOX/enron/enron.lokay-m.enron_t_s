As you know, safety is the top priority for ETS. Therefore, when we see incident levels rising in any area involving our employees, company property, the public, or public property, it receives an immediate focus and plan of action. This is the case with the increasing number of vehicle accidents occurring across the ETS operating system.

Here are the facts

?		To date, there have been 35 Vehicle Accidents experienced during 2001; this number has more than doubled the number reported for the entire year 2000.
	
?		Seventeen of the 35 Vehicle Accidents this year involved employees backing up and could have been prevented.
?	
?		Seven of these 35 Vehicle Accidents involved an employee striking a fixed object, each of which also could have been prevented.
?	
?	This means that 68% of the Vehicle Accidents this year have been preventable. Driver awareness training and continued communications have not had a profound effect on decreasing the number of preventable accidents.
?	
?	Action Plan
?	
?	In an effort to decrease the number of preventable accidents, effective immediately:
?	
?		All vehicle operators are required to use the "backing-in" policy when parking, AND conduct a "Safety Circle Walk" when leaving a parking space. The only exception would be when "backing-in" causes a greater safety concern. Each Operations Team is accountable to see that every team member meets these two requirements.
?	
?		Each employee involved in a Preventable Vehicle Accident will be required to personally review the details of the accident with the Operation's Regional Director and provide an overview of safe driving techniques at the next Team Safety Meeting. 
?	
?		Common based objectives for all ETS personnel are being immediately adjusted to include a "Safe Driving" component. Preventable accidents may impact the team's performance evaluation and could result in disciplinary action being enforced on the team and/or individual employee.

This Action Plan is designed to eliminate the rising number of motor vehicle collisions. It is not put into place to create a burden on anyone, but rather to ensure that all work is performed safely.  

Please join me in getting behind this initiative to raise awareness that the safe operation of every vehicle is required and that each employee is responsible for his or her decisions when behind the wheel.

REMEMBER:  Safety in Every decision, Believed, Practiced, Promoted and Uncompromised.

The ETS Mechanical Services, Compression Services and ETS Mechanical 
Integrity groups have been renamed ETS Power Services to better describe the 
focus of our business.  

ETS Power Services is responsible for data gathering and predictive 
maintenance analysis, coordination of scheduled & unscheduled maintenance, 
outage planning, overhaul management & inspection. We also supply the 
day-to-day mechanical expertise for over 700 reciprocating engines, gas 
turbines and compressors throughout the ETS system.  The name ETS Power 
Services helps to better define our role and the expansion of our business to 
support other Enron entities, as well as companies outside Enron in the power 
and natural gas industries.

Please feel free to contact me at 713-646-7624 should you have any questions,

or compressor maintenance needs.

In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched 
outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc.  
Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there 
appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition 
to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from 
Accounts Receivable.

Thank you, ETS!

Friday's United Way Appreciation Lunch was great fun.  Team ETS, Lisa Sawyer, Rod Hayslett, Colleen Raker, Brad Holmes, John Millar, John Keller, Marcello Minotti, and Pam Daily, made us proud.  

On top of being named Enron's Champion Lego Builder, ETS was also awarded Most Ambitious.  The picture in the link below captures our awesome team and our winning structure.  

Now let's show the rest of the organization that ETS employees are as generous as we are innovative, bold and talented.

At Friday's lunch, I challenged the other business units to raise more money for United Way and to have a greater participation rate than ETS.  We can't let this happen because I don't want to bake cookies for Mark Frevert!

To date, ETS has raised more than $214,000, which is about 62% of our total goal of $346,000.  That's the good news.  

The bad news is our participation rate is less than 50%.  I know we can achieve 100% participation.

If you've given to the United Way, THANK YOU.  Your contribution makes a difference right here in our community.

If you haven't made your contribution, you still have time.  Please log on to <http://cr.enron.com> today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution.  

If you don't have your GIS number or need assistance with keying in your contribution, please call Gina Taylor (x37681) or Sarah Haden (x53383).  

Please remember that contributions made last year don't automatically roll over to this year.  You'll need to enter your 2002 contribution on-line.

Your contribution to the United Way has an impact on one out of every two lives in the Houston community.  

Don't miss the opportunity to help Houston build its future.

Stan

Subject:	Low Load GRI changes for 2002

Rosemary - Please forward to everyone in Marketing'
Raetta - Please forward to everyone in Gas Logistics.

The GRI rates will change, effective January 1,2002
Commodity changes from .0070 to .0055
High Load Reservation GRI (default) changes from .090 to .066
Low Load Reservation GRI changes from .0550 to .0407
Small Customer GRI (GS-T contracts) changes from .0110 to .0088

Marketers:
As the attached letter explains, I have redetermined which shippers are considered "Low Load" for the coming year.
The changes from Low to High or High to Low are listed in the letter.  A few customers flip-flop from year to year.  If any of your customers are affected, please advise them before January Reservation invoices go out (February 1, 2002).  NNG files a tariff change for the new rates, but does not file or mail out any notices about changes in a shipper's high/low load status.
 

John Williams/Gas Logistics - FYI.  The spreadsheet lists legal entities that are in the High Load or Low Load categories for 2002.
If a shipper is not listed, then it will default to the High Load GRI rate.

 
Call if you have questions.

Please join me in congratulating Lynette LeBlanc, another 2000 Chairman's Award nominee.

Lynette, manager of HR Client Services for EOTT in Houston, is a shining example of how employees should treat co-workers and guests. Communication is her strongest attribute; always going out of her way to communicate effectively and making sure all employees are advised of changes and new developments. Lynette helps her department set lofty, but achievable goals, while always bringing out the best in people.

Again, congratulations to Lynette.

Stan

This past October, the Employee Selection Committee reviewed all of the=20
nominations (425 of them from across Enron and from around the world), and=

This week, I salute the two Chairman=01,s Award finalists from ETS:

  GPG and EOTT Operations have joined together to explore the idea of 
combining the technical services and field operations of the two groups in 
order to reduce costs and capture available synergies.

 We will be spending the next 30 days or so evaluating the pros and cons of a 
combination, including the accounting, legal and human resources implications 
of such a partnership.  We will keep you up-to-date as efforts move forward.

Continuing our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award, please join me in congratulating:

Morris Brassfield
Rick Brown
Bob Burleson
Gary Choquette

Morris, senior director of supply management in Houston, is responsible for 60-plus employees in a ten state area. During his employment, Morris has been required to close, move and establish field offices throughout the United States. He has also been involved in reorganizing and developing new ETS business units. Morris is an important leader in ETS.

Rick, a construction coordinator in Amarillo, was instrumental in the Kansas A-line abandonment project. He made sure affected landowners and the construction contractor were treated fairly. In one instance, he traveled several hundred miles to have a face-to-face discussion with a group of landowners to ensure that the project would be completed without adverse environmental impact. Rick's effort diffused a potentially large and expensive problem.

Bob, an account director in Houston, explains complex transactions and details about ecosystems with great ease. His prudent, careful and adept professional customer dealings are among the best. Bob is a true asset to Enron's customers and employees.

Gary, an engineering specialist in Omaha, is always looking for a more efficient way of doing work. He has the initiative to drive change in the work process. Often times this requires the software development of new tools. Gary is dedicated in problem solving and working on a consensus for a solution.

Again, congratulations to Morris, Rick, Bob and Gary.

Stan

At the 2001-2003 Capital ( Officer review) meeting Marketing agreed to review

spending our capital dollars where we anticipate doing transactions)  In 
order to help this process, attached is the Plan with locations identified.  

Please review this list for any inconsistencies  and inform Dave Clements of 
any concerns.  If at all possible, provide your comments by close of business

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

The following items were discussed in this week's corporate change control... 

May 24
>From 2:00 - 3:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will perform maintenance on the bridged network for gas control.  They are replacing the csu/dsu's in both routers.  There will be a total disruption of the gas control DRA segment to Omaha during this maintenance.

May 24
>From 9:00 p.m. through 5/25 at 8:00 a.m., the Corporate Server team will move the Personic Workflow applications to new servers.  This will result in a complete outage of the HR recruit tracking application.

May 26
>From 10:00 - 11:15 a.m., Enron Network Services will be migrating power to the switches in the EB28 floor wiring closet.  There will be an intermittent disruption while the switches are being moved.  This only affects devices on EB28.

May 26
>From 6:30 p.m. through 5/27 at 12:00 a.m., the Messaging team will remove and re-install Norton Anti-virus on nahou-msmbx05v.  They will also install Norton Anti-virus on all Houston and remote Exchange servers.  There may be intermittent disruption of messaging services during this maintenance.

June 1
>From 6:00 - 7:00 p.m., Facilities will open a chilled water piping bypass valve to the EB34 computer room to eliminate flow restriction.  No outage is expected.

June 9
>From 7:00 - 7:15 a.m., Enron Network Services will activate the four gigabit Ethernet channels between the Enron Building and Enron South.  No impact is expected.  

June 14
At 7:00 a.m., the Gas Measurement Team will deny access to the existing MIPS system (192.168.175.62).  The new PGAS gas measurement system will be enabled on Monday, June 18.  During the period from June 14-18, only gas measurement support staff will have access to the MIPS server.  If you have any applications that access the MIPS system, contact Sandy Jones or Jeff May for more information. 

FYI:	There will be freeze on all network changes from June 2 through June 16.  This includes changes to Enron Infrastructure (switches, routers, routing changes, new sites, etc.).

Tentative Dates on Changes Previously Submitted...

June 13
At 6:00 p.m., the ETS IT team will de-commission the old DSS "Smartstream" server,  ENEDS01_ADAPT. 

June 27
On May 15, the ETS IT team will migrate the database from the DSS "Smartstream"  server, ENEDS01_ADAPT to SQL2000, GTHOU-APPSQ03P/GTHOUSQRPT01P.  All DSS users will need to access the database on the new server after this change.

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan

We plan to post the following notice Friday, November 3 or Monday, November 
6, concerning a potential expansion of the TBPL point.  

We will also be publicizing this notice in Gas Daily and will be sending a 
letter to a few customers that bring in gas on TBPL now and plan to be part 
of the TBPL expansion.

Let me know if you have questions.  My phone number is 398-7707.

Why are we doing this?
In the spirit of the One GPG campaign, we are consolidating all of the GPG=
=20
Intranet sites to present a common look and feel by leveraging the latest w=
eb=20
technology.  This effort will reduce the cost to maintain these sites and=
=20
servers.

How will it affect me as a user? As a user you will be able to search the G=
PG=20
Intranet, create your own myGPG.com page and update content you are=20
responsible for whenever you need.

=01(.as a Webmaster?
By utilizing Content Management tools, Webmasters will be able to focus on=
=20
development efforts.  Standards will be put in place regarding navigation,=
=20
graphics, content and performance.  Tools will be available to check the=20
performance and usage of your site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team will be contacting Webmasters with content on the current=
=20
GPG website (www.ots.enron.com) to discuss the migration.  All content on t=
he=20
existing web server will be moved to the new GPG Intranet.

What is the future direction?
The initial rollout will include the migration of the existing GPG site=20
(www.ots.enron.com), content management of that information and the=20
myGPG.com. =20

Meetings will be setup with each operating company's Webmaster to discuss=
=20
timelines for integrating the remaining web servers into the new environmen=

As we continue saluting our ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award, please join me in congratulating:

Frank Sosa
Lewis Stiles
Steve Thomas
Jose Trevino

Frank, an associate administrative analyst in Roswell, NM, treats people he works with as if they were friends or family. You can always count on him to give words of encouragement and treat you with respect. Frank makes it a pleasure to come to work knowing that he will always be there with a wonderful attitude and a smile.

Lewis, an IT non-development specialist in Houston, is a person to go to gain knowledge about any new technology. He is always excited to see and find new ways to implement the latest inventions in a way to help with productivity. Lewis has set up several "brown bag" training sessions to help employees learn about and communicate knowledge about the software used.

Steve, an engineering specialist in Omaha, works hard to ensure a constant approach with all customers. He keeps the team focused on deadlines and commitments. He seeks out ideas of others. Steve drives the whole team to consistent, timely and quality work, while always looking for a better way to accomplish a task.

Jose, senior operations clerk in Pasadena, is respectful to everyone. He explains information in a way everyone can understand. He is always willing to help out, even if it is not part of his job. Jose is one others look up to as an example of a solid Enron employee.

Again, please join me in congratulating Frank, Lewis, Steve and Jose.

Stan

To GPG Skill Based Pay Employees


Effective July 1, the Skill Based Pay structure will increase for the=20
following Gas Pipeline and Gas Processing skill families:

Gas Pipeline Controls, Mechanical and Welding;
Gas Processing Instrumentation and Mechanical.

Attached are the Career Progression Charts for both Gas Pipeline and Gas=20
Processing.

These increases make it possible for us to remain competitive with salaries=
=20
paid by GPG=01,s peer companies.  Our Skill Based Pay structure targets the=
=20
fiftieth percentile of our peer company market and our actual salary and=20
total cash compensation continues to be in the top 10 percent. =20

Once again this year, we are placing premiums on skill families that suppor=
t=20
the future direction of our industry.  A premium value is being placed on t=
he=20
Pipeline Controls and Processing Instrumentation skill families.  This=20
premium provides an incentive to develop the skills of our current employee=
s=20
and to attract you to the controls skill family.  The premium is being plac=
ed=20
on blocks 1 and 2.  We are also placing a premium on the Mechanical skill=
=20
family as an incentive to attract and recruit skilled talent.  This premium=
=20
is being added to the top-level mechanical block. =20

In addition to these structure changes, other revisions to the SBP program=
=20
will be effective July 1. These changes include:=20

O&M Techs hired after July 1, 2000 will not be automatically moved into the=
=20
Sr. O&M Tech category.  After attaining O&M Tech 2, the qualified employee =
is=20
eligible to move into the Sr. O&M Tech category by responding to job postin=

to fill staffing vacancies.=20

Training for developmental skills may now be company supported based on tea=
m=20
needs.  Management approval is required.  Employees are not compensated for=

developmental skills.

The changes are also reflected in the 2000 SBP Program Administration Manua=

Earlier in the month, ETS IT employees and Enron Networks employees were presented the Gold Sponsorship Award at the Texas State Wide Summer Games for Special Olympics held in Arlington. Enron employees were given this award for their donation of time, as well as their ongoing support of the Guardian System and Special Olympics.  

The Guardian System, originally created by EDS and now supported by Enron employees, keeps scoring information and medical records, and other information on the athletes and the games. The system is now being used in other states besides Texas and is being considered for possible future use in the upcoming Special Olympics World Games. 

ETS IT employees Matthew Parchem, Ahmad Mousselli, Mike Dervin and James Regan provide technical expertise for the Guardian System, while walking with the project leader, Roger Fernandez of Enron Networks.

Karon O'Gorman, also an ETS IT employee, works with vendors to gather donations for computer equipment to be used during the games and coordinates safe and timely delivery of the equipment. 

This award given to ETS IT employees exemplifies the excellence and integrity we value at ETS and Enron. Congratulations!

Dear NESA/HEA Members:

Just a reminder that you should have received your renewal for 2001 in
December.  Your application is due by March 1, 2001, so don't delay in
returning your form and payment for $75 as soon as possible to ensure that
you are in this year's directory.  If you did not receive your renewal, you
can go to our website at www.nesanet.org and print an application to use.
Be sure and include your email address.

Also, ENERGY EXPO is right around the corner - March 20-22 at the George R.
Brown.  Delegate registration information is available at the website as
well.  Advance registration deadline is February 23rd, so get your
registration in to avoid the additional fee.  Make sure to attend the
General Session and come by the NESA/HEA booth for your chance in the prize
drawings!  Pipeline Updates will also be available during the trade show
hours, so don't miss this opportunity to gain some valuable industry insight
and information as well as catch up with your business contacts.  We'll see
you then!

TERESA A. KNIGHT
Vice President, Membership

Today, at Antioch Park, we'll thank all of our employees for a great Week of Caring and a great start to a successful United Way Campaign.  I hope you are planning to attend. 
 
Part of today's celebration includes a contest between Enron business units.  Each business unit will build a structure out of Lego's starting at 11:00 a.m.  
 
Please bring your noisemakers, cowbells, clapping hands, megaphones and loud voices to cheer on Team ETS!  The winning Lego structure will be determined by the amount of applause/noise each team gets.  With your help, we're a shoe-in for first place!
 
I hope you'll join Team ETS and me today.  The Lego contest begins at 11:00 a.m. and judging is scheduled for noon.  We'll need LOUD support during the judging!  Free lunch from Chidk-Fil-A will be served from 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.  
 
I look forward to seeing ETS out in full force!
 
Stan

All the mail boxes were re-done over the weekend.  Each has a label holder 
that will make it easier to move if someone leaves or someone new comes on 
board.  Management asks that you not put any stickers, emblems, colored dots 
or anything else to recognize your mail box.  If any box has to be changed 
next week, then they have to be scraped off.
>From the front, outside Fax Center,  Market Services starts alphabetically 
from the left to right on top row of the curve.
The alphabet continues to bottom row of curve from right to left.  HOT  TAP 
is at the end.
For Marketers, alphabetically starts at door into Fax Center and continues 
from left to right into the bottom row of curve.
Naturally, from inside Fax Center, alphabet starts with A's to the right and 
continues around.

Thanks and if you have any problems with any of this, please let me know.

As you know, the Enron Chairman's Award program recognizes employees who make a difference, one day at a time, by living Enron's Vision and Values in everything they do. The program, which is 100 percent employee-driven, enables all of us to nominate those of our fellow employees who we believe exemplify the Enron values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence. 
This past October, the Employee Selection Committee reviewed all of the nominations (425 of them from across Enron and from around the world), and selected the 11 finalists who comprise the Chairman's Roundtable. The winner of the Chairman's Award, EES employee Mark Harada, then was selected from this group and announced at the Enron Management Conference in November 2000.
During the next couple of months, ETS is going to honor its 35 nominees, including our two finalists for the award, by sharing the details of their nominations with each of you. Our employees, like the nominees from the other Enron companies, are everyday heroes who apply Enron's values to their work, their relationships and their communities. 
This week, I salute the two Chairman's Award finalists from ETS:
Amelia Alder
Craig Buehler
Amelia, an executive secretary in Houston, has taken excellence to new heights. In 1996, Amelia led an 11 member cycling team for the Multiple Sclerosis Society collecting $5,000 in pledges. Today, she has led this team to be the nationally recognized event leader with over 350 riders and a top fund-raiser with an amazing $500,000 in pledges! Thanks to Amelia's involvement, 1 out of every 6 dollars raised for MS is connected to Enron's name. Amelia's ability to communicate through cooperation and persuasion has resulted in unprecedented recognition for Enron. 
Craig, a senior analyst in Houston, has been identified as a "trendsetter" regarding communication. Today, we take for granted the technology our videoconference rooms provide us. But in the "early" days of Enron, in an effort to bridge the gap between Omaha and Houston, he would videotape individuals within groups and forward the film to the other location. He was the human link that spanned two cities and helped two cultures become one. As a tribute to his efforts, a large number of bonds exist today as a result of his efforts to promote a sense of esprit de corps and friendship. Craig was also responsible for creating Enron Kids, now a favorite employee volunteer activity during the holidays that gives students a complete outfit of clothes, a pair of shoes, a jacket, a toy and a book.
Please join me in congratulating Amelia and Craig.
Stan

The Team concept has given us numerous opportunities for improvements over the past several years with Team members continuing to be recognized and rewarded for their positive efforts and accomplishments. As accomplishments are made, trust and responsibilities increase, and the Team experiences growth, maturity, and the associated rewards.

A part of this growth and maturity must include the realization and acceptance of the Teams responsibility to monitor and enforce Company policies and procedures. As you heard from me in 2000, I will protect those who are complying with and enforcing our requirements, but I have zero tolerance for those who choose not to do so. Along with the rewards for positive efforts, there are also consequences for those who fail to act when circumstances call for action. 

During the year 2000, several ETS employees received disciplinary action as a result of their failure to act and/or ignoring safe work practices. These cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a Safety Bulletin. It has been my intention that we all learn from these instances to make our work place even safer. 

As we publish this first, and hopefully only, Safety Bulletin in 2001, I would like to share with you two instances from last year.

After repeatedly counseling a fellow team member observed violating several safety requirements (including hard hat, safety glasses, FRC), one Team took action, which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged. While this may seem to be a harsh outcome, it is much better than the person injuring themselves, or even worse, a fellow team member. This person had others expressing concern over his well-being and chose to ignore the warnings. Individual team members acted on their responsibility and the team as a whole accepted their accountability.

In the second case, a team member chose to drive a Company vehicle without using a seatbelt. The employee was involved in an accident ejecting him from the vehicle, causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt would have been properly used. This employee is lucky to be alive. Use of seat belts by all occupants of Company vehicles is one of the most basic elements of our program and has been a requirement for over 20 years. As the use of seat belts is habit forming, could this have been the first time the employee failed to use them? Is it possible that other Team members had observed this failure in the past and not acted? Could this have been prevented through positive interaction? Had positive interaction been taken but ignored?

When the Declaration of Interdependence was introduced in 1998, we made the commitment to each other that we would be our Brothers and Sisters Keeper and to remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all times. While some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our requirements, that does not relieve the person from their responsibility. Likewise, a Team is responsible and accountable for the actions (or lack of a required action) of each Team member. Each individual team member and the team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action that management may be required to take.

Please assist us in creating the safest work environment possible.  Our most important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home safely each and every night, and should expect nothing less from peers or members of your leadership to hold you accountable for doing just that.

Jim Prentice, President of Enron Clean Fuels, was recently honored by Child Advocates, Inc. with the Hero Sword award.

The Hero Sword is the highest honor bestowed upon donors, supporters or volunteer leaders of Child Advocates, Inc.  This award was presented to Jim in recognition of his outstanding leadership as Chairman of the BP Houston Children's Festival for the past three years, raising more than $1 million to support the efforts of Child Advocates Inc.  Jim has been involved with Child Advocates since 1996.

"Jim truly is deserving of this award, as it is symbolic of his efforts in slaying the dragons of child abuse, making him a hero to the many children whose lives he changed for the better," said Tony Terwilliger, manager of special events for Child Advocates, Inc.

Congratulations Jim.

Danny has mentioned that he will make phone calls to any of our customers that we think may be concerned about the Enron situation and how it may impact the ongoing business of Transwestern.  Please pull together a list of customers (ASAP since Danny will be out of the office tomorrow) that you think need a personal phone call from Danny.  Audrey has volunteered to combine our lists for us, so please submit the customer, name of contact, title and phone number to her within the next couple of hours.  

Thanks, Kim.

On Friday, November 3,  at 4:30, we will be migrating the ETS QuickPlace 
server.   The maintenance is expected to last approximately 30 minutes

What does this mean to you?

Users who access the IdeaBank or any QuickPlace discussion sites, i.e.  ETS 
Infrastructure, Program Office, ETS Standards will not be able to access them 
until the server has been brought back up.

The IdeaBank will automatically be rerouted to the new server.  However, any 
references to GTHOU-WW01P/QuickPlace  will need to be changed to 
NAHOU-LNWW01/QuickPlace.
 
If you have any concerns about this maintenance, please contact the Customer 
Assistance Center at 713-345-4745

Once again, it's time to find out what you think about your work experience=

at Enron and Enron Transportation Services Company, and what we can do to=
=20
help make it better.  That's why we want to check your pulse.  In fact, we'=

changed the name of last year's "Excellence Through Communication" employee=
=20
survey to The Pulse.  We believe The Pulse more accurately captures the=20
purpose of the survey.  Your diagnosis will help us correct problem areas s=

we can continue to make Enron a great place to work.

Is available:  Monday, Oct. 16 - Friday, Oct. 27
Is located at: survey.enron.com

There are a few things we want you to remember about The Pulse:

1. Your survey responses will be confidential.  You can complete your surve=
y=20
from special computer kiosks that will be set up in some of our larger=20
offices.  Several group computer terminals also will be available in smalle=
r=20
field offices. We want to provide you with the most comfortable environment=
=20
possible, as your participation is of vital importance to us. Alternatively=
,=20
you can key in your responses from your desktop computer. The responses key=
ed=20
from your desktop will be confidential as well.

2. We will respond actively to your comments.  We are going to do our best =
to=20
cure some of the current problems that exist and put into action preventati=
ve=20
processes that will help identify smaller problems before they become major=
=20
ones.  We may ask for your help in resolving some of the issues that are=20
collected in the survey - your active role will help us identify the best=
=20
solutions.
In last year's survey, you identified several problem areas regarding=20
internal communications, workload and performance management. We've already=
=20
acted on many of your recommendations.  These are a few of the things we've=
=20
accomplished in direct response to your input:

=01  ETS strengthened management focus on intellectual capital and employee=
=20
through the initiation of:
=01  Table Talk sessions with ETS Office of the Chairman, which give employ=
ees=20
the opportunity to have frontline discussions,
=01  The "Innovation Series," which invites employees to share their ideas=
=20
openly and ensures management commitment to evaluating ideas,
=01  E-Speak sessions with ETS leaders to exchange ideas, and
=01  Our name change to Enron Transportation Services to recognize our most=
=20
strategic asset - you.

=01  We made workload planning and management training/development availabl=
e to=20
ETS employees to address workload issues, the greatest ETS concern in the=
=20
survey.

=01  We improved the consistency of performance management, the survey topi=
c=20
that received the most employee comments, by extending the use of the=20
Performance Evaluation Process (PEP) system and the Performance Review=20
Committee (PRC) process to all levels in ETS at mid-year in 2000.

Please take a few minutes to check your pulse and tell us what you think an=
d=20
how you feel about your job and about Enron.

We look forward to hearing from you

This worked out better the last time.  Either you did not bother to launch 
and read this or you liked the pdf file better.  Either way, I received a lot 
less negative feedback!  So, I'm doing it again.  I am sending you the pdf 
file.  Double click on the attached and launch in Acrobat reader.  

If you have problems or, if you really would like a different way, let me 
know.  Just respond to this note or call me at 713-853-3986.  If you prefer a 
printed copy or a non-graphic version, let me know that too.

A message from my friends at Channel 8.
-----------------------------------------------------------
An FYI from HoustonPBS/Channel 8:

I have had a couple of calls regarding airing of the PBS documentary
"Blackout" on tonight's Frontline program.

Due to our pledge schedule, Frontline will not air in the regular 9:00 p.m.
timeslot.  Instead, Channel 8 will air Frontline at 10:00 p.m. tonight
(Tuesday, June 5).

A second airing of " Blackout" is scheduled for Tuesday, June 12th in
Frontline's regular timeslot at 9:00 p.m. We apologize that these changes
were not made in time for publication.

I know this program is of interest to many of the firms in EWI, especially
our energy companies, so I wanted to give you a heads up regarding the
correct air times so you have a chance to let your executives know of the
time change.

Please pass the information on to all interested parties in your company.

Frontline "Blackout" airs:

Tuesday, June 5, 2001 at 10:00 p.m. CST
Tuesday, June 12, 2001 at 9:00 p.m. CST


Thanks,

Vicky Tarpey

Thank you for your participation in the Pulse survey this past October.  We=
=20
achieved our highest response rate ever, with more than 1,400 ETS employees=
=20
(63%) participating in this important feedback process.=20

The survey results, too, are very encouraging.  Most elements improved and=
=20
ETS=01, strengths continue to be in the area of our employees, just as Enro=
n as=20
a whole has been recognized by Fortune magazine for our employees and=20
management.  ETS received high marks from employees for the following areas=
:

 =01  People are treated with respect and dignity - 76%
 =01  Information from management is believable - 74%
 =01  Supervisors deal fairly with everyone - 72%
 =01  Teamwork is encouraged - 71%
 =01  Employee benefits are satisfying - 68%
 =01  ETS is well-managed - 66%

I am pleased with these results, because I believe they exhibit a strong=20
belief in Enron=01,s core values, Respect, Integrity, Communication and=20
Excellence.  These results are indicative of the quality of ETS employees a=
t=20
all levels.

In this recent survey, just as in 1999, workload was a concern, with 39=20
percent of survey participants saying they believed they did not have enoug=
h=20
time to complete all of the work required of them.  While we have made some=
=20
strides at alleviating this concern as compared to the December, 1999 and=
=20
June, 1999 surveys, I believe that we can do better still by shifting=20
resources as business needs change, eliminating unnecessary work and more=
=20
effectively using technology.  I would also encourage you to consider the=
=20
variety of training and development offerings available in the areas of=20
workload planning and management. =20

You also voiced concerns with communication across departments.  I take you=
r=20
concerns very seriously and will ensure that ETS focuses on further=20
improvements in this area.
=20
A summary of what we heard from ETS employees has been added to our intrane=
t=20
site.  Click on the following URL to view our survey results:  =20
http://www.ots.enron.com/etc/PulseSurvey.htm

Even beyond this survey, I continue to be interested in your thoughts on=20
improving the ETS organization.   Please feel free to send me your ideas vi=
a=20
e-mail or interoffice mail.  You can also send your ideas to Gary Smith, Vi=
ce=20
President of Human Resources or to any of the ETS management team.

The Pulse enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee, so yo=
ur=20
continued participation is critical to its success.  I hope you will choose=
=20
to be a part of future surveys, the next of which is scheduled for the fall=

of 2001. Your input is essential in creating and shaping ETS to be the best=

it can be.

Thank you again for participating in the 2000 Pulse survey.

FERC Gives High Sign to WI Pipe Competition

      The northern Illinois and southeastern Wisconsin gas transportation 
markets, which long have been dominated by
      ANR Pipeline, moved one step closer to obtaining pipeline-on-pipeline 
competition yesterday when FERC awarded
      the proposed Guardian Pipeline LLC a favorable preliminary 
determination on non-environmental issues. 

      The decision was a major win for the proposed greenfield pipeline 
because not only did it shoot down most of the
      arguments presented by ANR to thwart the project, but it found that 
even though the project would "adversely
      affect" landowner interests, Guardian was making "reasonable efforts" 
to mitigate the impact on landowners. 

      Moreover, FERC ruled that while the $224 million pipeline would compete 
head-to-head with ANR, it would not
      have a negative affect on the Coastal pipeline and its customers. "On 
balance, the Commission finds that the
      proposed Guardian pipeline will provide substantial public benefits 
with minimal adverse impacts," the order said
      [CP00-36]. 

      The Commission also found that sufficient need was established for the 
36-inch, 140-mile pipeline that would
      transport 750,000 Dth/d of gas from the Chicago Hub to markets in 
northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin,
      providing customers there with an alternative to ANR and access to 
competitive Canadian gas supplies. It would
      terminate near Ixonia, WI, where it would interconnect with Wisconsin 
Gas Co.'s distribution system. At the
      Chicago Hub, the pipeline proposes to interconnect to Alliance 
Pipeline, Northern Border Pipeline, Midwestern Gas
      Pipeline and Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America. 

      Guardian has executed 10-year precedent agreements with four shippers 
for 702,500 Dth/d, which equals about
      94% of the project's design capacity. The largest shipper by far will 
be Wisconsin Gas, which has committed itself
      to 650,000 Dth/d of the capacity on the proposed line. In fact, the 
Guardian project is an outgrowth of Wisconsin
      Gas's request for proposals (RFP) process in June 1998, which the LDC 
initiated in anticipation of the expiration of
      its firm transportation contract with ANR in October 2003. The other 
shippers on Guardian include Alliant Energy
      (10,000 Dth/d), WPS Energy Services Inc. (2,500 Dth/d) and an unnamed 
shipper (40,000 Dth/d). The project has a
      targeted in-service date of Nov. 1, 2002. 

      In multiple protests filed at the Commission, ANR argued that 
Guardian's application was "patently deficient"
      because it didn't include the proposed lateral that Wisconsin Gas plans 
to build to interconnect with Guardian.
      Wisconsin Gas currently is seeking the approval of state regulators to 
build the lateral. Furthermore, ANR claimed
      Wisconsin Gas was using its monopoly power as a franchised LDC serving 
southern Wisconsin to subsidize the
      Guardian project. Wisconsin Gas's parent, WICOR Inc., is one of the 
sponsors of Guardian. The other backers are
      CMS Gas Transmission and Storage and Viking Gas Transmission. 

      But FERC rejected both arguments. "While previous attempts to inject 
competition into ANR's market in this area
      have failed, we believe that this area is ripe for competition, and 
that it is only a matter of time before other
      pipelines submit similar proposals to the Commission. We find that the 
proposed project will provide southeastern
      Wisconsin with access to another source of supply, which will allow 
this market to enjoy the benefits of
      pipeline-to-pipeline competition for the first time," the order noted.

The year-end performance evaluation process is a great opportunity for employees and their supervisors to review accomplishments for the year and identify opportunities for personal growth.  Additionally, it is an opportunity for each of us to provide meaningful performance feedback to help others.  This memo is intended to summarize the major elements of this important process and clarify the timeline for year-end 2001.

(Note: ETS employees on self-directed work teams that participate in the Skill-based Pay program will complete team and peer performance reviews as they have in the past and are exempted from the discussion that follows.)

Feedback and Evaluation
Employees will solicit 360? feedback on their performance via the PEP system. The supervisor will use this feedback, along with other performance data about the employee, to prepare a written evaluation of the employee's performance for the year.  The employee and supervisor will then meet and discuss this evaluation which provides an objective measure of the employee's performance against expectations.  The performance evaluation is an opportunity to discuss accomplishments, areas for improvement and goals for the next year.  No overall performance rating will be designated.

?	PEP System open for feedback			November 19 - December 7
?	Performance discussions with supervisor	December 10 - January 14
?	Written evaluations due to HR			January 15

Training for all employees on how to use the PEP system will be available via online tutorials.

Compensation
Increases in an employee's base pay for merit, promotion or equity can be recommended by an individual supervisor based on the employee's performance, current responsibilities and salary.  Division Head approval is required.

As always, incentive awards are paid at the discretion of the Enron Board Compensation Committee and the Enron Office of the Chairman based on company and business unit performance. Once bonus pools are approved, individual bonuses will be determined by division and department heads based on employee performance.

Relative Talent Reviews
Relative talent reviews will occur beginning January 16, 2002 and will include discussions of Managers and above.  The focus is not on relative ranking but on identifying employees who best demonstrate the performance, skills and behaviors that are valued at Enron.  Each Division will identify its top 10% and discuss the utilization of its top talent.  Employees who may be ready to assume greater responsibilities will be discussed.  Recommendations for promotions will be considered up through Senior Director.  EGS executive management will review Vice Presidents and Managing Directors and identify the top 10% in this officer group.  Nomination for promotions to Vice President and Managing Director levels will be made to the Enron Management Committee, which will make final decisions on these promotions.

If you have any questions about any aspect of this year-end process, I encourage you to contact your HR representative.

Gary

The mission of ETS Operations Technical Services (OTS) remains unchanged.  
Our goal is to be an integral part of field operations, provide the highest 
level of technical support possible and assist the field operations teams in 
achieving their objectives.  To that end and as a part of ETS's on-going 
transition of merging  ETS's and EOTT's Operations, I am pleased to announce 
a realignment of ETS Operations Technical Services.  

The purpose of these changes is to better align our technical resources with 
the new Operations Areas and teams and better serve their needs.  Therefore, 
we will form Area Technical Support Teams for each of the Technical 
disciplines (Corrosion, Measurement and Controls & Electrical):  

Max Brown, Director of Corrosion Services, will lead the Corrosion teams.
Kenneth Cessac, Director of Measurement Services, will have responsibility 
for the Measurement Support teams.
Ken Crowl, Director of Controls and Electrical Services will provide 
leadership to the C&E teams.  
Steve Klimesh, Business Consultant, will provide on-going support to ETS on 
UAF and other continuous improvement initiatives.   
The Clifton and Beaver machines shops will remain a part of OTS as we 
continue to grow the Enron Machine and Mechanical Services business.  

The attached organizational charts show the new Tech Services.  The vacancies 
reflected on the charts are an effort to shore up our technical support staff 
for operating the EOTT assets.  In the coming weeks, our Technical Support 
Teams will be further defining their support roles to the Region and team 
level and working diligently to fill these vacancies.  Any thoughts or 
comments that you might have regarding these changes are certainly 
appreciated.  Please feel free to call me or any of the OTS Directors with 
your feedback or for assistance.  Our goal is to continue to provide the best 
service possible to you, our customers.

ETS proved it's winning ways by being named Enron's Champion Lego Builder at the United Way Appreciation Lunch this past Friday.
  
I appreciate your participation in the United Way campaign.  To further continue the amazing efforts, I encourage you to participate in this worthy effort if you have not already done so.  Enron is a Pacesetter Company for the United Way and in that spirit, lets blaze the trails and have a rate of 100% participation.

To date, ETS has over raised more than $242,00 which is about 70 % of our total goal of $346,000 with a 60% rate of participation.  I am pleased to report that my group has a 72% participation and I commend your efforts.  I would like to aim for 100% participation by Wednesday evening.  If you have not logged on to make a difference in the Houston community, we encourage to make a donation today or by Wednesday noon.

As added incentive to encourage a 100% participation rate, a drawing for Astro's tickets will be held Wednesday night. The tickets for the lottery are for great seats (near the Astro's dugout) on September 13th versus San Francisco, game time 7:05 pm.  

To participate, log on to <http://cr.enron.com> today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution. Once you have completed your donation, contact Julie Armstrong by email and your name will be placed in the lottery for the Astro's tickets.  We will have two drawings with two tickets giving four lucky people a night at a Astro's game.

Thank you for your participation in the United Way.

2:00 p.m - ETS Employee Meeting at the Hyatt Downtown in the Exhibit Hall and Omaha Room 227 - please note the change in meeting time.  

All ETS employees are encouraged to attend this meeting to hear what's going on across ETS from our Leadership Team.  This meeting will be like no other, so be sure to come!

Please join me and my family at Star Wars: The Magic of Myth at the Museum of Fine Arts, Audrey Jones Beck Building, as we celebrate our ETS successes and Rock Meyer's Enron career.  

At the reception you and your family will enjoy the infamous Star Wars exhibit hassle-free with no long lines and no time limits while you're viewing the exhibit.  You'll also have the opportunity to wish Rock Meyer and his family all the best as they head for Arizona.

On top of that, we'll have great food and beverages, crafts for the kids, raffle prizes and a few surprises!   

With free parking connected to the museum via the tunnel, you'll have spare change to spend in the Star Wars gift shop!  Kids of all ages are welcome, including ones in strollers.

>From the Desk of Steve Kirk:


It is a pleasure to announce that Michele Winckowski will transfer from Certificates & Reporting to Rates & Tariffs effective September 1.  Michele replaces Ranelle Paladino who will transfer to the Pricing Desk in Northern's Business Development and Marketing Division.

Michele's Enron experience spans 22 years, starting as an Integrator Operator.   Over the next 10 years, she moved into various administrative and accounting positions where she gained experience in disbursements, property accounting and financial planning.  She joined the Regulatory Affairs Division in 1989 as a Regulatory Analyst.  Over the next 12 years, she developed additional expertise in the Cost-of-Service and Certificates areas, which prompted a promotion to Sr. Regulatory Analyst in 1993.  Her strong accounting and regulatory background will be a real asset to the Rates & Tariffs Deaprtment .

We look forward to Michele's transfer and the strengths she brings to her new position.

This year's Enron United Way Campaign kicked off last week with Leadership Giving.  The company-wide campaign along with Week of Caring kicks off on August 6.  ETS' Day of Caring is on August 9 at the Harboch Ripley Center in southeast Houston.  Please contact Kimberly Nelson to volunteer for a morning or afternoon shift at ETS' Day of Caring.  
 
To celebrate a successful Campaign and Week of Caring, an employee appreciation lunch will be held on Friday, August 10, at 11:00 am at Antioch Park across the street from the Enron building.  In correlation with this year's United Way campaign theme, "Building Houston's Future," and in the true spirit of Enron, there will be a building competition among the business units at the lunch.  
 
Each business unit will form a team and build something with building blocks at the August 10 appreciation event.  
 
Rod Hayslett, Phil Lowry and I will lead Team ETS.  To form the rest of Team ETS, we thought it would be fun to have a little contest.  
 
Here's the contest:  Correctly answer all of the questions in the link below by Wednesday, August 1, at 5pm, and your name will be entered into a drawing.  NO late entries will be accepted.
 
We'll draw 7 names from the entries received and if your name is drawn, you will be an official member of Team ETS and help build the most incredible structure imaginable with me, Rod and Phil.  We'll announce the lucky winners on Thursday, August 2.  
 
At the August 10 celebration, all of the business unit building block structures will be built and judged based on Enron's attributes - smart, innovative, bold, ambitious, and united.  Ken Lay will host the Applause Meter and the business unit with the greatest amount of applause will win.  We need all of our ETS employees outside cheering on Team ETS.  Free lunch is included in the deal as well.
 
Let's have some fun with this!  With your help, Enron and United Way will be successful at Building Houston's Future.  
 
Good Luck!
 
Stan

It is with sincere sadness that I inform you of a tragedy that occurred.  Doug Hammer, an Enron Northern Natural Gas senior operations and maintenance technician located at the LNG facility in Wrenshall, Minnesota, died earlier this week.  Doug gave many years of dedicated service to EOTT and most recently Northern Natural Gas.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Doug's family.
 
Recognizing this is a difficult time for us all, the Enron Employee Assistance Program is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Please call 713.853.6057, or 1.800.345.1391 for assistance.  

Additional information about the program is also available via the Enron intranet site at: <http://hrweb.enron.com/employeeServices/workLife/resourcesReferrals.asp>

ETS' Day of Caring is Thursday, August 9.  To date, we have over 65 ETS volunteers - thank you!  More volunteers would ensure ETS' success.  

On Day of Caring, ETS will be working at the Harbach Ripley Center located at 6225 Northdale.  Transportation will be provided to and from the Enron building to the Center.  Bright yellow t-shirts are available for all of our ETS volunteers.  T-shirts can be picked up at EB1638E.  

Box lunches will be available for Day of Caring volunteers at the Enron building.  Morning volunteers will get their lunch when they return to the Enron building, and afternoon volunteers will get their lunch when they leave for the Harbach Ripley Center. 

Specifically, during the Day of Caring morning and afternoon shifts, we'll be painting, replacing baseboards, cleaning and interacting with the seniors and the children at the Center.  All of these activities are indoors.    

There have been several questions about whether you have to take vacation to participate in the ETS August 9 Day of Caring.  You DO NOT have to take vacation.  However, please make sure you coordinate your time out of the office during Day of Caring with your team and/or supervisor.

Please sign up to volunteer for Day of Caring via the on-line link below, and indicate which shift, morning or afternoon, you prefer.  

Please contact Kimberly Nelson (x33580) with questions.  

Pull out your working boots and let's have some fun together at ETS Day of Caring!

Kevin Hyatt, Director for the TW Commercial Team,  is a member of the Enron 
Kids Committee.  He has again volunteered to be the GPG coordinator for those 
of you interested in adopting or contributing to the Enron Kids Christmas 
campaign.

This year the Committee has adopted HISD's Burrus Elementary.

If you're not familiar with Enron Kids, this is the program where Enron 
adopts all the kids in a local school where a majority of the families are 
living near or below the poverty line.  The adoption consists of groups of 
employees selecting one or more children and buying a full set of clothes 
(including socks, underwear, shoes, and an overcoat) plus a toy and book.  
The approximate cost is $125 per child adopted.  All the gifts are 
distributed by the Committee during a party at the school several weeks 
before Christmas.  In a lot of cases, our gifts are the only things the kids 
will get this year.

If you're interested in participating--  Here's what you do:

Reply via email to Kevin Hyatt with your anticipated $ donation.  Kevin will 
be in charge of collecting funds and coordinating the buying of presents.  If 
you (or your spouse or significant other) want to volunteer to assist with 
the shopping, please let him know.  Kevin will provide a daily update of the 
donations total.  Please let Kevin know your donation by Tuesday November 
14.  We will adopt the maximum number of kids on Wednesday November 15.

Thanks for your assistance.

We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. 

At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of "safety net" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.

The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under "ETS HR Manuals". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . 

I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

Stan

No impact is expected.
July 12	
>From 11:30 p.m. through 7/13 at 3:00 a.m., the ETS server team will move the existing EMC box approximately six inches.  During this maintenance Prestige Flooring will install additional floor pedestals in preparation for installation of the new EMC box.  No impact is expected.
July 13
>From 3:30 - 5:00 p.m., Telephony services will transition a second fiber ring from in-house fiber to MAN.  This maintenance will create redundancy for the ATM Network for telephone systems at EB, 3AC and ECS.  No impact is expected.
July 13
>From 5:00 - 5:15 p.m., the Corporate Server team will migrate one General Purpose 2 Terminal Server from Oracle 7.3 to Oracle 8i and put it in the GP2 cluster as the primary server.  All applications on Terminal Server are Oracle 8i compliant.  Applications being developed require Oracle 8i, and current Terminal Server General Purpose cluster is running Oracle 7.3.  No impact to ETS users is expected.
July 13
>From 6:00 p.m. through 7/15 at 5:00 a.m., Facilities will perform the monthly routing maintenance on the EB34 data center's CRAC (Computer Room Air Conditioning) units.  This maintenance includes checking/changing air filters and belts, and cleaning out condensation drip pans, pipes, and drains.  No impact is expected.

July 14
>From 7:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Facilities will install water piping to supply emergency backup CRAC units in the EB34 data center to provide emergency cooling capacity.   No impact is expected.

July 14
>From 7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m., Facilities will install new power whips on the 34th floor in the ETS server area.  While no outage is expected, due to the nature of the work, the possibility of a power disruption does exist.

July 14
>From 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m., Facilities will switch the EB34 data center's cooling loop to the backup roof chillers to verify functionality.  If a partial failure of chillers occurs, problem identification and resolution will proceed with data center load still on roof chillers (which could result in a gradual temperature rise in the data center until resolution is complete).  A protracted run of the chillers will continue through Saturday.  No impact is expected.

July 14
>From 9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m., Telephony services will add Caller ID Name & Number to ISDN PRI Trunks on EB and 3AC telephone systems. Trunk groups will be taken down in stages so that back-up trunk groups will still send and receive calls.   Software and hardware changes will be made to trunk groups and circuit boards to allow for new caller-id protocol.  Intermittent service disruptions could occur including fast busies, no dial tone, and call disconnects if you are on a trunk that is busied out during the change.  If you are disconnected, redial to hit a back-up trunk.  These changes will not affect long distance calls.  Please call Harold Williams at x58917 or Cindy Siniard x30558 with any questions.  

July 14
>From 7:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will connect the core Enron Center North and Enron Center South switches.  No impact is expected.

July 16
>From 6:00 p.m. through 7/17 at 10:00 p.m., Facilities will temporarily remove the door from EB3460 to allow access for the new ETS EMC equipment.  Plastic will be installed to control environmentals.  A guard will be placed 24 x 7 while door is down.  All traffic will be routed to EB3450 doorway.  After ETS EMC equipment is moved in on Tuesday 7/17/01, in the evening the door will be reinstalled.

July 20	
>From 9:00 p.m. through 7/21 at 1:00 a.m., the Messaging team will reboot servers as part of their normal maintenance schedule.  Users on the mailservers listed below may see intermittent outages during the reboots:  ECTHOU-LN3, ECTHOU-LN4, ECTHOU-LN5, ECTHOU-LN6, ECTHOU-LN7, ECTHOU_LN2, NAHOU-LN10, NAHOU-LN11, NAHOU-LN12, NAHOU-LN14, NAHOU-LN8, NAHOU-LN9.

It is a special pleasure to announce that Steve January has been promoted to Senior Director, effective immediately.
Steve's promotion is well-earned recognition of his significant impact on Gas Control, Market Services and ETS.  His 28 years of operations, pipeline dispatch and scheduling experience, as well as his credibility with our customers and other ETS and Enron business units influenced the ETS Management Committee's decision to promote him.
Please join me in congratulating Steve.

	ETS Intranet Consolidation Project Updates (www.ETS.enron.com)
What is the status of the consolidation?

Completed Sites:
The core ETS Intranet Site, www.ets.enron.com
ETS Solution Center 
http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/Solution_Center/default.htm
Self-Directed Task Force http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/SDWT/default.htm

Sites in Progress:
Safety Site http://www.ots.enron.com/safety/default.htm
Design and Records Management
Engineering Standards http://www.ots.enron.com/docs/stds/0000-1.htm

How will this consolidation affect me as a user? As we roll out new sites, 
any bookmarks to the old sites will need to 
be modified.  If you navigate to an old site, you will see a redirect message 
requesting that you update your bookmarks and a link to the new site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team will be contacting Webmasters with content or applications 
on the current ETS website (www.ots.enron.com)
to discuss the migration.  All content and applications on this web server 
will be moved to the new ETS Intranet before the end of the 2nd quarter.

Questions
LaDonna Dervin is the project manager for the project and can be reached at

We continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award. This week, please join me in congratulating:

Bob Martinez
Johnny McGee
Corrine Miller
Jim Nelson

Bob, director of non-IT development in Houston, is a highly revered person. He goes above and beyond the call of duty to treat others with respect at work and outside of work. Bob is well respected by his teammates and coworkers.

Johnny, director of right-of-way in Houston, sets the pace for the pack to follow. He can follow, but he is also a great leader. He shows that we can be more than we are if only we believe and trust our business sense. While setting goals, he wants you to succeed and is an encourager. Johnny is the type of person who thinks it is better to be well done than well said.

Corrine, senior project coordinator in Omaha, was a crucial part of the new accounting/ management reporting system (SAP). In her commitment to excellence and desire to make Enron the best it can be, Corrine worked many long hours to assure the project cost issues were given high priority during development and implementation.

Jim, senior tech O&M in Willmar, MN, shows invaluable integrity as a Willmar team member and an Enron employee. He provides excellent quality customer service. While responding to some tense issues of customer/company relations, Jim acted very professional and followed up to all questions and concerns of both Enron and the customer. Jim always carries a greeting smile and a waiting handshake.

Again, please join me in congratulating Bob, Johnny, Corrine and Jim.

Subject:	August 1 Fuel Rates

Rosemary - Please forward to everyone in marketing.

Anticipating FERC approval this week, Reg Affairs has loaded the revised fuel rates into the system to be effective August 1.
Any nominations made for August, beginning on Saturday, July 28, will be calculated using the new rates.
In in the unforseen event that FERC has not approved the new rates by August 1, we will restore the old rates & reprocess all August  nominations.

The revised rate matrix is attached.  Please Click on the Excel file & print for reference (3 pages)
(TI & TF rates are unchanged.)

The new UAF is .24% (.0024).
The new FDD Fuel rate on Injections, August-October, is .92% (.0092).

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.

We have a great deal of work underway with our continuing operations, bankruptcy related issues, managing asset sales transitions and major operating environment issues.  While I have great confidence in our ability to overcome challenges, we will need to simultaneously direct our attention on a number of key areas to be successful.

In light of the above, I have asked Danny McCarty to take on a new role as managing director of special projects for Enron Global Services (EGS).  Danny's responsibilities will include a number of complex bankruptcy related activities, the workout of certain troubled assets and optimizing the value of selected businesses.

Until the question of our right to repurchase Northern Natural Gas is resolved, it is better to minimize organizational changes.  Consequently, I do not plan to replace Danny as managing director and chief commercial officer of Enron Transportation Services (ETS) at this time.  Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Rob Kilmer, Shelley Corman and the business development efforts will report directly to me.

I truly appreciate Danny's willingness to take on this responsibility.  His involvement should ensure that we dedicate the necessary attention to key business issues, while allowing Jim Hughes and me to focus on the priorities of a reorganization plan and our day-to-day operations.

As always, thank you for your continued dedication and support.

Stan

With the realignment of ETS, we want to remind you of the procedures for 
booking company aircraft service.  As you probably know, one Enron plane has 
been designated for use by ETS for travel between Houston and Omaha and for 
other trips as approved by the vice presidents or us.  Of course, a key 
consideration for approval is the number of passengers, which generally is a 
minimum of 4 - 6, and/or the difficulty of reaching the destination(s) by 
commercial airlines.  The plane is booked on a first come, first served 
basis.  To encourage maximum utilization of the plane, a weekly schedule is 
published and distributed to ETS support team members each week.

Virginia O'Neill coordinates the plane schedule and will continue to do so 
for all trips originating from Omaha.  In addition, we have begun utilizing 
charter aircraft service for trips originating from Omaha within a mileage 
range of 700 - 800 miles.  The utilization of charters for these trips will 
reduce travel costs by eliminating deadhead costs.  Virginia will continue to 
coordinate charter trips from Omaha also.  Beginning today, Julie Armstrong 
will coordinate trips originating from Houston.  Julie and Virginia will work 
together to continue publishing the weekly plane schedule so that travelers 
can utilize the plane when available.   Please remember that company plane 
usage requires the approval of your vice president.  If employees are 
reserving individual available seats on a scheduled flight, vice presidential 
approval isn't required.

If space is available, personal travel for employees and their immediate 
families is permitted.  Imputed income for the cost of the flight will be 
included in the employee's W-2 form at the end of the year.  Please remember 
that personal travelers are always subject to being bumped up to departure 
time by business travelers and that the schedule is subject to frequent 
change.

Please have the following information available when contacting Julie or 
Virginia to book a flight:

 Date of travel & destination  
Lead passenger's name
Other passenger's names (generally need 4 - 6 passengers)
Departure & return times
Ground transportation requirements (if rental cars are required, 
please have the individual's American Express number or Emerald Isle number 
available).
 Purpose of the trip
 Coding if the trip is being charged to a work order

We will continue to monitor usage of the company plane to maximize its usage 
and provide needed private aircraft service for ETS.  In addition, we expect 
that, except for NBPL, the actual aircraft usage cost will be billed directly 
to the user's cost center in year 2001.  However, the billing details are 
still being worked out and will be communicated when finalized.  If you have 
questions or comments, you may contact either of us or Julie or Virginia.

Recently, Julie Armstrong, senior administrative assistant to Danny McCarty, was honored by the Arthritis Foundation with the "All Star Salute to Excellence" award. This award is given annually to a person who suffers from arthritis and demonstrates excellence towards the community and the foundation.

As an individual who battles with arthritis, Julie's been involved with the Arthritis Foundation for over four years. During this time, she has worked on various committees for the Arthritis Foundation's All Star Salute to Secretaries.

In addition to the Arthritis Foundation, Julie volunteers her time and support to other non-profit organizations, including the Sunshine Kids and Houston Aeros Charities event benefiting the Stehlin Foundation.

Congratulations Julie.

Recently, Enron Corp received a request from the U.S. Environmental Protect=
ion Agency (EPA) to provide information relating to any spill, discharge, o=
r release of "oil" (broadly defined but excludes natural gas or liquid petr=
oleum gas) from any EOTT pipeline facility for the time period from July 1,=
 1998 to July 7, 2001. A "pipeline facility" includes those fleet operation=
s where tanks are connected by/to pipelines or to other tanks through pipin=

iled information concerning releases of "oil" during this period, including=
 among other things, the extent and nature of the spill, which EOTT or EPSC=
 representative/employee was the first to learn of the spill, remedial effo=
rts, weather conditions at the release site, etc. The request also seeks in=
formation concerning pipeline management system(s) in place during this thr=
ee-year period and efforts or investments made by EOTT to prevent the relea=
se of "oil," including capital costs, expenditures and maintenance costs.=
=20

In order to respond to the EPA information request, you are instructed to i=
dentify and locate any relevant documents or information and ensure that no=
 responsive information or documents are destroyed or discarded. You may be=
 contacted about this inquiry in the near future, because we will be sendin=

een contacted/visited by one of our teams by August 17, 2001, please contac=
t the designated document custodian, Don Hawkins (713-646-7358).

Due to the length of the EPA information request, we have not attached the =
document here. However, if you would like a copy, have any questions concer=

Gina, this one is going to   Enron Transportation Services - Houston



I want to take a moment to say "thank you" to all the employees who 
participated in the ETS Food & Toy Drive. We delivered over 10 boxes of food 
and toys on Friday to the Downtown location of the Head Start program.

There are many people in the Houston community who need our help and support, 
especially during the Holiday Season.  Through your kindness, the Head Start 
Program, ETS' adopted United Way agency,  will be able to help those less 
fortunate.

The pictures below capture some of our employees displaying the donations 
that were collected in the Enron building.  The collections in Three Allen 
Center were significant as well.   

Thank you, again, for your overwhelming generosity.

The GPG Safety Declaration of Interdependence signed by all GPG pipeline=20
operations staff is our promise to each other that safety on the job is fir=
st=20
before all other concerns, that we will positively act to assure safe=20
practices. This Safety Advisory Bulletin No. 6 is issued to reinforce the=
=20
need for personal safety at all times and in all circumstances.

On April 12, a One-Call ticket was issued for the work being done adjacent =
to=20
one of GPG=01,s pipelines. The ticket did not identify GPG as having facili=
ties=20
in the area so GPG was not notified.=20

Sometime after April 12, a GPG employee observed a contractor working in th=
e=20
vicinity of an active pipeline. The employee located and marked the pipelin=
e=20
in the area where the contractor was working. On May 8, the contractor was=
=20
excavating approximately 75 to 100 feet downstream of the marked pipeline,=
=20
routing a water line, and uncovered a 12-inch pipeline that was assumed to =
be=20
abandoned. The contractor was willing to incur the cost of removing a secti=
on=20
of the abandoned pipeline if the facility owner would ensure it was=20
abandoned.=20

The contractor requested a One-Call ticket to mark all underground faciliti=
es=20
in the area of the excavated 12-inch pipeline. GPG was notified, via fax, o=
f=20
the line locate request. The GPG employee who previously had located and=20
marked the pipeline informed the contractor that he was unaware of any=20
abandoned pipelines in the area, but that he would investigate further.  Th=
e=20
employee checked his pipeline drawings and consulted with other team member=
s=20
and learned that there was an abandoned pipeline in the area. Team members=
=20
also informed him that the accepted practice for checking abandoned pipelin=
es=20
was to drill into the pipe. =20

On May 9, the GPG employee entered the contractor's excavation and drilled=
=20
into what he assumed was the abandoned pipeline. The employee, believing th=
e=20
escaping medium was air, decided to let the pipe vent until the pressure=20
relieved. After two hours of venting and no noticeable reduction in pressur=
e,=20
the employee re-entered the excavation to check cathodic protection reading=
s.=20
At this point the employee determined that the drilled pipeline was venting=
=20
gas. Gas Control was informed of the situation and steps to shut-in, blow=
=20
down and repair the pipeline were implemented.   =20

After a thorough inquiry by the GPG Incident Investigation Team, the Senior=
=20
O&M Tech involved in the incident was disciplined as a result of his failur=
e=20
to follow the procedures listed below, and to reinforce the importance of=
=20
safety interdependency.=20

GPG Operating Procedures, 110.310, Gas Testing; 110.170 Confined Space Entr=
y;=20
110.260 Excavation; and 110.570 Work Permits :
No gas testing was done by the GPG employee to identify escaping medium.
No gas testing was done before the GPG employee entered the excavation=20
considered to be a permit entry confined space.
No gas testing was done before an ignition source was introduced into a=20
possibly hazardous atmosphere in the excavation.
No Confined Space Entry permit was issued when the employee re-entered the=
=20
excavation to take cathodic protection readings.
The employee entered an excavation with inadequate means of egress.
No hot work permits were issued by the employee.

GPG Operating Procedure, Blowdown and Purging 80.409 :
The employee did not communicate, in a timely manner, the planned blowdown =
to=20
residents of the adjacent neighborhood.

GPG Operating Procedure, Event Notification Sequence  10.101A :
Gas Control did not notify the GPG environmental specialist of the release =
of=20
natural gas.

GPG Environmental Procedure, Spills and Releases 2.1.10  :
The release of natural gas was not reported to the GPG Division Environment=
al=20
Specialist.

GPG Operating Procedure,  Damage Prevention 80.102 :  =20
The employee did not properly use maps when marking the pipeline.
The employee did not mark bends or other changes in the direction of the=20
pipeline.

PLEASE NOTE THE PRACTICE OF DRILLING INTO A PIPELINE TO DETERMINE IF IT IS=
=20
ABANDONED IS UNACCEPTABLE AND SHALL NOT BE UTILIZED.

Pre-existing abandoned pipe removal practice shall be as follows :

GPG employees shall contact local management when a pre-existing abandoned=
=20
pipeline must be removed to allow routing of other facilities. Local=20
management will contact the Engineering Department to evaluate the facility=
=20
and provide guidance to the team on how to proceed with pipeline=20
identification and the ensuing removal of the facility.=20

Abandoned pipelines that will not be removed shall be treated as an active=
=20
pipeline and marked in accordance with  GPG operating procedure 80.102

Moving Forward

The Pipeline Safety Department will review and revise GPG Operating Procedu=
re=20
80.102 to ensure that team members use all available resources to clearly=
=20
identify an existing pipeline as active or abandoned.

The GPG Pipeline Safety Department is investigating why the GPG facility wa=
s=20
not identified on the April 12 One-Call ticket.=20


Near Misses

 There was potential for the contractor's backhoe operator to rupture and=

 There was potential for  natural gas to ignite under traffic plates coveri=
ng=20

I figured these would be pretty self explanatory.  As always, let me

eProcurement

Today marks the launch of the iBuyit eProcurement tool within Enron Transportation Services.  While many employees are using eProcurement through the B2B procurement tool, starting today, employees throughout ETS should utilize the iBuyit eProcurement tool to purchase O&M expense materials, office supplies, IT hardware and both fleet and capital work order material.  

Using iBuyit is a milestone in the Enron-wide cost saving effort.  This new tool will enable us to monitor and analyze our expenses and enhance our value with preferred suppliers, as well as help us control costs more effectively.   

The iBuyit eProcurement tool also has the potential for unlimited growth when partnered with the ETS Procurement organization, the GSS organization and good business sense.    

As you use iBuyit, please provide Morris Brassfield and the iBuyit team feedback to ensure that the eProcurement tool becomes and remains a valuable and integral part of our purchasing activities.

Please visit the iBuyit portal to logon to iBuyit eProcurement to access training information and materials and learn more about Enron's business-wide cost savings opportunities: <http://ibuyit.enron.com>.  To logon enter your User ID (P number) and Password (initial password is ENRON1).

If assistance is needed, please contact your trainer or call the ISC Customer Care line at 713.345.4727.

For general information about iBuyit or the eProcurement upgrade, please send your questions via e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>. 

Thanks, in advance, for using the iBuyit eProcurement tool to minimize costs.

As we continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award, please join me in congratulating:

Robert L. "Bob" Johnson
Rich Jolly
Hasan Kedwaii
Greg Lewis
Teb Lokey

Bob, senior facilities planner in Omaha, demonstrates a zeal for excellence in his work and in his desire to meet customers' needs. Bob's efforts towards revenue management goals, expansion projects, and development of new tools are direct contributions to Enron's goals.

Rich, regional director for Transwestern in Albuquerque, doesn't demand respect, but earns it by deeply caring for all those who work under him. Many times he may be required in the field at 7:00am and may have to drive 3-4 hours to get to the location, but he is always there. He believes in open communications and never holds back information unless it is confidential. Rich doesn't point out anyone's faults, but suggests ways to improve, then assures all the resources are there to make the improvement.

Hasan, manager of IT development in Houston, is always honest and sincere in letting customers know what can and cannot be accomplished by his group. He does not promise what cannot be delivered. Hasan listens respectfully to everyone's viewpoints and replies courteously with a full explanation of why he agrees or disagrees with their ideas.

Greg, manager of IT non-development in Houston, is open, honest and sincere with customers and vendors, along with being a good negotiator. Greg listens to his employees and passes information along to keep employees updated on projects.

Teb, director of rates and tariffs in Houston, can always be depended on. When he commits to do something, it will be done. Teb does his part, and keeps others on track to get their part completed within the deadline and often helps others in a bind to get the job done.

Again, please join me in congratulating Bob, Rich, Greg, Hasan and Teb.

Stan

Effective immediately, Joe Jeffers, Manager of Technical Training and Skill 
Based Pay Administration, and his team of Dick Heitman, Cliff McPherson, 
Andrea Woody and Lupi Trevino will move from ETS Human Resources to ETS 
Operations Technical Services.  Joe will report to Steve Klimesh.  

This move will better align Technical Training and SBP Administration with 
Operations and enhance the interfaces that take place between this group and 
ETS Operations management and the field teams. 

Joe and his team have provided outstanding support to Operations in the past, 
and it is expected that this high standard of customer service will 
continue.  We will be sending more information in the very near future with 
regard to the individual support accountabilities of the team members.  

Please join me in welcoming this team and helping to make their transition a 
smooth one.

	  ETS Intranet Consolidation Project Updates (www.ETS.enron.com)	

What is the status of the consolidation?

Completed Sites:
The core ETS Intranet Site, www.ets.enron.com
ETS Solution Center http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/Solution_Center/default.htm
Self-Directed Task Force http://www.ets.enron.com/Services/SDWT/default.htm

Sites in Progress:
Safety Site http://www.ots.enron.com/safety/default.htm
Design and Records Management
Engineering Standards http://www.ots.enron.com/docs/stds/0000-1.htm 

How will this consolidation affect me as a user? As we roll out new sites, any bookmarks to the old sites will need to 
be modified.  If you navigate to an old site, you will see a redirect message requesting that you update your bookmarks and a link to the new site.

What are the next steps?
The Intranet team will be contacting Webmasters with content or applications on the current ETS website (www.ots.enron.com)
to discuss the migration.  All content and applications on this web server will be moved to the new ETS Intranet before the end of the 2nd quarter.

Questions
LaDonna Dervin is the project manager for the project and can be reached at 713.853.7103 if you have any questions regarding the project.

The Pasadena Chamber of Commerce has selected the Enron Clean Fuels Methanol Plant as "Industry of the Year" for 2001.

The selection was based on the plant's community activities; awards/recognitions received related to safety, environment and quality; organizations supported by plant employees, and the positive impact the plant has on the local business community.

Hats off to the employees of the Enron Clean Fuels Methanol Plant for this special recognition!

Once again, we continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award. Please join me in congratulating:

Julie Cobb
Jackie Griffith
Rod Hayslett
Arnold Hill
Steve January

Julie, a senior tax and audit specialist in Omaha, offers insightful perspectives and helps employees see the bigger picture of reasons behind an occurrence. She speaks openly and strives to provide balanced views on an issue. 

Jackie, a transportation administrator in Omaha, is polite, respectful and professional when dealing with both customers and internal employees. She is often the first contact many customers have when they are getting acquainted with Northern Border. She received her 25 year service award in the year 2000.

Rod, managing director and chief financial officer, Houston, has a great capacity for listening and has an open and relaxed manner creating an atmosphere where people are encouraged to suggest new ideas. He is helpful in exploring new ideas, listening attentively and providing constructive comments. He makes his employees feel like an important member of the team.

Arnold, a division technical specialist in Glasgow, MT, was a key player in establishing a professional rapport with the station site contractors personnel, inspectors, vendor representatives and engineering staffs throughout the course of the Northern Border Chicago Project . Arnold identified many items requiring change at the first station being constructed to facilitate ease of maintenance that were incorporated into the design of subsequent stations.

Steve, senior director of gas control in Houston, treats all employees with respect and fairness. While listening to all thoughts and ideas, Steve enables employees to be the best they can be.

Again, congratulations Julie, Jackie, Rod, Arnold and Steve.

Stan

As many of you know, yesterday we closed on Dynegy's option to acquire Northern Natural.  Shortly, a more comprehensive message will be distributed about that transaction and what it means for all of us.  

One important requirement under that transaction is that Enron Operations Services Company has agreed to continue providing certain services to Northern consistent with our past operations.  Northern will be billed for those services, and we will be required to demonstrate the basis for those billings.  

Effective, Feb. 1, all employees in the ETS family of companies that perform any services for Northern or related to Northern's operations in any way should keep timesheets documenting the amount of time spent on Northern projects or supporting personnel and activities related to Northern projects.  

If there are any questions about this requirement, please communicate with your department head or with me.  Thanks for your help in implementing this important requirement.  

Jim

The Team concept has given us numerous opportunities for improvements over 
the past several years with Team members continuing to be recognized and 
rewarded for their positive efforts and accomplishments. As accomplishments 
are made, trust and responsibilities increase, and the Team experiences 
growth, maturity, and the associated rewards.

A part of this growth and maturity must include the realization and 
acceptance of the Teams responsibility to monitor and enforce Company 
policies and procedures. As you heard from me in 2000, I will protect those 
who are complying with and enforcing our requirements, but I have zero 
tolerance for those who choose not to do so. Along with the rewards for 
positive efforts, there are also consequences for those who fail to act when 
circumstances call for action. 

During the year 2000, several ETS employees received disciplinary action as a 
result of their failure to act and/or ignoring safe work practices. These 
cases were distributed to all employees in the form of a Safety Bulletin. It 
has been my intention that we all learn from these instances to make our work 
place even safer. 

As we publish this first, and hopefully only, Safety Bulletin in 2001, I 
would like to share with you two instances from last year.

After repeatedly counseling a fellow team member observed violating several 
safety requirements (including hard hat, safety glasses, FRC), one Team took 
action, which ultimately resulted in this person being discharged. While this 
may seem to be a harsh outcome, it is much better than the person injuring 
themselves, or even worse, a fellow team member. This person had others 
expressing concern over his well-being and chose to ignore the warnings. 
Individual team members acted on their responsibility and the team as a whole 
accepted their accountability.

In the second case, a team member chose to drive a Company vehicle without 
using a seatbelt. The employee was involved in an accident ejecting him from 
the vehicle, causing injuries that could have been prevented if the seat belt 
would have been properly used. This employee is lucky to be alive. Use of 
seat belts by all occupants of Company vehicles is one of the most basic 
elements of our program and has been a requirement for over 20 years. As the 
use of seat belts is habit forming, could this have been the first time the 
employee failed to use them? Is it possible that other Team members had 
observed this failure in the past and not acted? Could this have been 
prevented through positive interaction? Had positive interaction been taken 
but ignored?

When the Declaration of Interdependence was introduced in 1998, we made the 
commitment to each other that we would be our Brothers and Sisters Keeper and 
to remind each other of the need to comply with safety requirements at all 
times. While some employees may feel uncomfortable enforcing our 
requirements, that does not relieve the person from their responsibility. 
Likewise, a Team is responsible and accountable for the actions (or lack of a 
required action) of each Team member. Each individual team member and the 
team as a whole are responsible for the outcome and any disciplinary action 
that management may be required to take.

Please assist us in creating the safest work environment possible.  Our most 
important personal goal should be to do whatever it takes to arrive home 
safely each and every night, and should expect nothing less from peers or 
members of your leadership to hold you accountable for doing just that.

Thank you for your participation in the Pulse survey this past October.  We achieved our highest response rate ever, with more than 1,400 ETS employees (63%) participating in this important feedback process. 

The survey results, too, are very encouraging.  Most elements improved and ETS' strengths continue to be in the area of our employees, just as Enron as a whole has been recognized by Fortune magazine for our employees and management.  ETS received high marks from employees for the following areas:

	?	People are treated with respect and dignity - 76%
	?	Information from management is believable - 74%
	?	Supervisors deal fairly with everyone - 72%
	?	Teamwork is encouraged - 71%
	?	Employee benefits are satisfying - 68%
	?	ETS is well-managed - 66%

I am pleased with these results, because I believe they exhibit a strong belief in Enron's core values, Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.  These results are indicative of the quality of ETS employees at all levels.

In this recent survey, just as in 1999, workload was a concern, with 39 percent of survey participants saying they believed they did not have enough time to complete all of the work required of them.  While we have made some strides at alleviating this concern as compared to the December, 1999 and June, 1999 surveys, I believe that we can do better still by shifting resources as business needs change, eliminating unnecessary work and more effectively using technology.  I would also encourage you to consider the variety of training and development offerings available in the areas of workload planning and management.  

You also voiced concerns with communication across departments.  I take your concerns very seriously and will ensure that ETS focuses on further improvements in this area.
 
A summary of what we heard from ETS employees has been added to our intranet site.  Click on the following URL to view our survey results:   http://www.ots.enron.com/etc/PulseSurvey.htm

Even beyond this survey, I continue to be interested in your thoughts on improving the ETS organization.   Please feel free to send me your ideas via e-mail or interoffice mail.  You can also send your ideas to Gary Smith, Vice President of Human Resources or to any of the ETS management team.

The Pulse enables us to focus on real issues affecting each employee, so your continued participation is critical to its success.  I hope you will choose to be a part of future surveys, the next of which is scheduled for the fall of 2001. Your input is essential in creating and shaping ETS to be the best it can be.

Thank you again for participating in the 2000 Pulse survey.

Once again, we continue our salute to the ETS employees nominated for the 2000 Chairman's Award. Please join me in congratulating:

Janet K. Place
Jim Prentice
Gaye Lynn Schaffart
Derike Shelton

Janet, a vice president and general counsel in Omaha, constantly faces numerous projects on a senior management level. She is always cognizant of others' challenges on a business and personal basis and takes it into consideration in working with others. Janet's character shines through her work and how she deals with others.

Jim, President of Enron Clean Fuels, Houston, has been an employee on Enron for 30 years. He is committed to being the best and bringing out the best in all those who come in contact with him. He is highly respected both as an individual and also professionally. Even after all his years at Enron, and so many positions along the way, past employees still contact Jim with ideas, problems to solve, or just to stay in touch. Jim is a leader in excellence.
 
Gaye Lynn, director of business planning and analysis in Omaha, creates a very open environment as a supervisor and team member. She freely solicits new ways of doing things from her employees and her coworkers and is willing to share the success of a team project. By creating an open environment, Gaye Lynn brings out the best in her employees and coworkers by allowing and encouraging team members to take risks and try new ways of doing business.

Derike, a senior tech O&M in Trimont, MN, is a great communicator with an enormous vocabulary which is used to inform, enlighten and instruct all who come in contact with him. He is often the team spokesman because of his ability to not only convey messages in a clear and precise style, but with passion. Derike shows the spirit and drive that makes Northern Border, ETS and Enron extraordinary places to work.

Again, congratulations Janet, Jim, Gaye Lynn and Derike.

Stan

	As you may be aware, I am conducting an in-house seminar on compliance with labor and employment laws and the practice of good employee relations.  This 4 hour, interactive program is tailored to Enron's culture and ETS-specific issues.  Stan Horton and the ETS Division Heads have mandated attendance for all Managers and above, and for those persons who have supervisory responsibility.

	The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-related litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee productivity.  In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to understand the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal requirements.

	Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassment free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance management; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to effectively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.

	There are three sessions open in October -- the 3rd, 17th, and 31st.  They run from 8:00 to Noon.  Please 
contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in one of these sessions.  She will then provide you the exact location and other particulars.

	Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Effective, July 1, 2001, a number of measures and recommendations were implemented to reduce costs associated with travel, entertainment and professional services throughout Enron.  As ETS employees, it is our responsibility to follow the Enron-wide cost-savings guidelines below:

Travel and Business Expenses

?	Air Travel - Reducing air transportation costs is Enron's top priority.  Please take advantage of Enron's negotiated discounted airline fares by using ClickTrip, the Enron-managed online travel booking service, located at <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.  Although use of Travel Agency in the Park ("TAP") or the Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS)-approved preferred travel agency for your location are still available, ClickTrip is the tool we should all use.

ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination (excluding proprietary carriers) and assists employees in making the most cost-effective travel decisions by providing the most current information.  In addition to bringing an estimated savings of 20%, ClickTrip is easy to use and is accessible 24 hours a day from any internet-enabled personal computer.  After-hours telephone support is also available.

When making travel reservations, please purchase non-refundable coach tickets when flying in the U.S., for these tickets can cost up to 65% less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed, if necessary, for a $100 fee.

?	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has negotiated preferred rates at a number of worldwide hotel chains, as well as with National and Alamo car rental companies.  For more detailed information, please visit <http://travel.enron.com>.

?	On-line Expense Reporting - All requests for reimbursement of business-related expenses should be made through XMS, the new on-line expense account reporting tool.  Please access XMS at <http://xms.enron.com>.

?	Off-site Meetings - To schedule off-site meetings and events for more than 10 people, please contact Tracy Ramsey, GSS Director, Travel and Transportation Services Portfolio Team at (713) 646-8311.

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 646-8311.  


Professional Services

To better leverage Enron's purchasing power, all new professional service expenditure arrangements including legal, financial, accounting, engineering, information technology and others, and those due for renewal, must be negotiated through, or in consultation with, GSS.  Contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by both GSS and ETS. Prior to engaging GSS, please submit all service requisition forms to Rod Hayslett, Danny McCarty, Phil Lowry or me for business unit approval.  

To comply with the professional service procedure, a Professional Services Requisition form must be completed.  This requisition can be accessed on-line at <http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/servicesprojectrequestform.xls>, or by contacting Ron L. Smith, GSS Director, Administrative and Indirect Services Portfolio Team at (713) 345-6329.
    
Additional information about Enron's cost-saving initiative will be on ETV, in eBiz and Enron Business, as well as in information booths in the Enron Building.

As we all work together to reduce costs across Enron, please forward additional cost-saving ideas to <recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com>.  

If you have additional questions, please contact Derryl Cleaveland, GSS Senior Director of Operations, at (713) 646-7024.
