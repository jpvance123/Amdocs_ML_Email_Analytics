John,

Sorry to bother you with this but, we are working with these cities to assess 
the extension of their gas supply contracts with Engage.

The price under the Engage contracts is effective July 1st - June 30th of 
each year and is based upon indices in the US Southwest and Alberta for the 
previous 12 months.  Thus, we can project the price for the contract and 
compare it to our forward curve (at AECO) to determine the best course of 
action:  extend or terminate.

The following summarizes the comparative pricing I need.  If the analysis 
indicates that these contracts should be terminated, Enron would be in a 
position to supply gas to these entities at AECO.

Quantity:    8,000 MMBtu/d baseload
Term:     July 1, 2000 - June 30, 2001
Delivery Point:   NIT (AECO)
Pricing:    Fixed in $US/MMBtu

Thanks for your help,

Laird

I agree.  If we ultimately trade out of Toronto, the P/L responsibility will 
probably role into you.  It looks like we were trying to close Garret Tripp 
(Associate) to move to Toronto and start looking at this stuff.  If he is 
going, you should meet with him before he goes.

John,

Thanks for your help with Husnain.  I think he will be a solid asset for EBS

As for the "trade", I do not think that I should be brokering a personnel 
deal like that without the individual's input.  However, I would definitely 
encourage you to talk to any of my people that you would like to have.    I 
have an open door policy, if they want to pursue other internal jobs.  

After speaking with you last week, it was very clear to me that you were 
unsatisfied (unhappy) with my failure to be specific about individuals that I 
was recruiting.  I will not make that mistake again.  I would ask only that 
you inform Jim or myself of the individuals that you would want to recruit.

Additionally,  I think that you and Kevin Hannon have spoken about an 
exchange program in which our junior commercial people would be able to 
rotate through a transaction intensive trading group.  I think this type of 
program could be mutually beneficial and I would appreciate if we could talk 
about this in greater detail.

Regards,

Paul

We have shown you the following:

The power spreadsheets reflect the actual contracts closed and we have 
demonstrated in the charts the number of active transactions by month. I.E. 
you are correct. Welcome to "emerging power markets".

On the gas side there was some confusion of how to reflect the supply 
transactions. It has been corrected and is noted below. 



In either case the volumes and numbers are small but there is a market 
willingness to transact. The question is "are there clear two ways". The 
reality is that this is very far away from the world of US energy. I have 
stated that this is not trading but rather structured origination based upon 
a trading principals and philosophy and cleared through a trading format. 
Maybe the market will emerge to a more sophisticated level but for now we 
just need to be able to clear the positions reasonably.

We are also trying to advance the model to a more liquid format but that is 
done through our regulatory efforts and commercial education. Every day is a 
new challenge.  

Do you have any other questions or formats I could assist you with?

MFG

The number of trades doesn't seem to match between your presentation and the 
spreadsheet data.  The spreadsheet shows 17 power trades this year and your 
presentation shows almost that many every month.  Same comment for the gas 
side.

It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of 
power in Ontario.  

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to 
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including 
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the 
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the 
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for 
Ontario.  

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto 
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could 
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have 
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use 
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there, 
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know 
the people and the technical resources available to him.

If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.

John

Just to confirm from our telephone conversation, I will be depositing 
$8,046.60 Canadian to your TD account.  This is a retroactive payment per 
David Oxley.  I'll forward you the calcuation as well.

I have a 1:10 meeting so I can't attend your marketing meeting.  I thought it 
might be a good idea to grab Lambie at noon and get him to attend your whole 
meeting.  He might have some insights into Alliance among other things.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

Subject: athena vs quark

With regards to the message below, we must have athena (server) to run our 
nightly risk books for the power group.  We run one of our three east power 
calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

Subject: NYMEX Advisory Committee Meeting

A quick summary of the NYMEX meeting I attended on August 10.

1.   eNYMEX  NYMEX has begun developing an internet based trading system to 
replace Access and to handle basis trading.
   The system is targeted to launch some time during Q4  2000.   The basis 
products that might be traded are    Nymex swap, AECO (C$/gj  fxd/float), 
Transco Z6, Chicago City Gate, Houston Ship Channel.

2.  TAS   Overwhelming support of the TAS pilot program from trade players 
with locals opposed.  A motion was passed to    add expiration day to the 
current TAS pilot program.  The motion is to be presented to the NYMEX board 
in the    next few weeks.    

3. AGA data release Favorable comments regarding the 1pm release of the 
weekly storage data.     

4.  Sabine Hub discounts  Sabine is considering offering some discount 
through the Hub for volume commitment. 


Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject: EES Pre-holiday Update

Regulatory:

Based on the on-going CA PUC hearings and opinions of Enron legal and 
regulatory groups, it seems that the Commission is likely to increase tariff 
rates by anywhere from 10 to 20% (PG&E and SCE are arguing for a 30% increase 
- not realistic). The critical decision is to leave EES direct-access 
customers on that tariff. Alternatively, if the PUC rules to end the rate 
freeze, eliminates the existing CTC credits and does not allow EES customers 
to switch to this tariff, we stand to lose somewhere between $600-650 
million, as EES would have to serve their customer loads by buying expensive 
CA power during 2001.

A 10% increase in tariff rates results in ~$50 million loss for EES. However, 
if the tariff is extended beyond 2001, it will create additional value for 
EES (the tariff is lower than Cal-02 power prices). 

CA Gov. Davis met with Clinton yesterday where they have decided to extend 
the emergency status in the state.

Ken Lay is scheduled to meet with Davis today to address the following topics:
 - clarify any inaccurate information about Enron's role in CA markets
 - urge the Governor to not go overboard with this situation and give the 
"world" to the CA utilities
 - remind about the upside PG&E and SCE will realize from high valuations of 
hydro plants (increased almost three-fold from a year ago)

Hearings and oral arguments will continue this week. CA PUC decision is 
expected to come on Jan-4th, followed by multiple appeals.

Credit issues:

 - Enron is attempting to reduce credit exposure with PG&E, whereby PG&E will 
assign its out-of-the-money trades with Avista and MS to EPMI and    EES will 
assign its in-the-money positions with PG&E to EPMI, creating an off-set. 
These assignments will reduce PG&E exposure by ~$265 MM,    in exchange for 
Avista and MS exposures.
 - PUC is not likely to rule removal of retail tariff retroactively (to May 
99) - this will enforce EES position in collecting its accounts receivable 
from    PG&E of ~$150 MM (so far, they have not paid Enron on the premise of 
retroactive ruling).

Market Risk:

12/27 VaR is $7.8 MM - limit violation. An increase of $0.5 MM because of:
 - addition of long Feb-01 positions at MidC
 - overall increase in prices
 - incorrectly booked trades at PJM (50 MWs Cal-03 Long instead of a Short)

My suggestion, at a high level, to Don Black and Dennis Benevides to sell MWs 
in both East and West in order to reduce VaR. However, because of the 
holidays the liquidity in the market is very scarce.

Vlady.

I wouldn't mind waiting a few weeks to go to Portland.  PRC is going to eat 
up a lot of time in the next few weeks and it would be nice if Mike Swerzman

John,

Terrell Benke was a summer Associate from the University of Chicago who has 
just accepted Enron's full-time employment offer.  Erik, her husband, 
currently works at Goldman Sachs as a junior trader in Chicago.  Therefore, 
since Terrell will be moving to Houston, Erik is very interested in pursuing 
potential trading opportunities at Enron.

Please look at his resume and inform me if you have any interest in his 
background.

Jonathan,  in the email below are examples of the US Natural Gas Long 
Descriptions we have come up with for the Tokenised Periods "Day Ahead" and 
"Balance of Month".  The Short Description for these products will have the 
specific dates in it whilst the long description will not.

Thus we need toi have language that will adequately describe the tokenised 
period.

I am not familiar with the rules and specific calendar holidays that needs to 
be referenced in the relevant part of the long description.

Can you use the US ones we have done below as a start point come up with 
language to describe the:
Day Ahead
Balance of Month
periods for Canadian Gas that will cover the weekend and holiday periods.

Mark, are you the appropriate legal counsel to review the tokenised 
descriptions for Canadian Gas?


Thanks

Now that the accrual book is fresh on your mind, I would like to propose the 
following for Schedule C prudency:

1)  Monetize $20 million of the 2001 accrual gas position to be utilized for 
the following Schedule C prudency accounts:

$10 million against the JEA (Northern Florida) short position (170,000 MWh's 
on-peak).   We have mid-marketers attempting to buy energy for 01 and 02 in 
FL, however, the market is extremely tight with no competitive offers.   The 
JEA position is covered with FPL non-firm power, therefore, we are exposed to 
on-peak price volatility due to FPL economic curtailment during load 
management periods.
$3 million against the VEPCO market-based call option with a look back audit 
on pricing.  This deal is an absolute pain in the ass because we are forced 
to quote a price to VEPCO that is representative of an actual transaction at 
reasonable prices with a rationale counterparty in the SE market.  They can 
call on the MW daily, weekly, or monthly.   We can lose as much as $2-3 
million/yr on this BS position due to the logistical issues and look back 
audit rights that VEPCO has.
$2 million against the MJMUC (inside Associated Electric Coop) 40 MW 7x24 
short position in a transmission constrained market area with absolutely no 
liquidity.  We have this position marked against the Entergy curves, however, 
physical delivery is a major issue which creates curtailment (and LD$) 
uncertainty.
$5 million against the OPPD 110 MW daily shaped call (with hourly 
flexibility) that is nearly impossible to hedge cleanly.   OPPD is in 
Southern MAPP (Nebraska) and delivery risks are significant.  The total deal 
is in our books at negative $25 million (10/2/00 curves) and we potentially 
have an additional $5 million of exposure due to illiquid nature of MAPP, 
scalar risk, and physical delivery risk.

We have several other customer deals that have hair, however, they are 
generally more manageable from a physical delivery standpoint.   Each of the 
deals above are in illiquid markets with delivery problems and scheduling 
flexibility for the counterparty that is incosistent with the current power 
trading market.   For these generic reasons and the specific issues outlined 
above, I am recommending Schedule C prudency for the amounts indicated 
above.  
>From my standpoint, it is prudent and appropriate to use $20 million from gas 
accrual gains to finance these prudency positions.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its "Safety First" culture and track
record of commercial success.

I'm expecting more details from Bill re. Perry Gas but I'm quite pissed about 
this.  I will deal with my traders when I have the details.  On the Retail 
side, I think this is the problem in trying to set up a separate Wholesale 
trading group in retail which is clearly happening.  This wouldn't of 
happened it they were trading through us.

Subject: Perry Gas Companies, Inc.

John,

As discussed today, I have attached a summary of ENA's credit exposure to 
Perry Gas Companies, Inc (approximately $1,800,000).  They have filed for 
bankruptcy on August 28, 2000.  It should also be noted that our July 
settlement was not offset by our purchases due to an apparent oversight by 
the Settlements group, resulting in an additional $678,000 of credit 
exposure.  EES's credit exposure is still being researched but is estimated 
to be over $5,900,000 of additional exposure.  We are working with EES to 
resolve these issues as well.

As I mentioned today, Perry Gas Companies, Inc. was not approved for credit 
on any of these transactions and was on our Credit Watch List.  This company 
was not an approved counterparty and was granted a zero credit line.  

We are still trying to get the list of trades and traders for the July 
transactions.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Bill

Ed, sounds like you have this handled - I would like to use your report as 
the example to use in other groups.  It can wait until you have it all 
completed.  You may want to think about EOL as well (ie) how many companies 
have you brought on-line, etc.

 summary:
  - coverage metrics;
  - market iniatives;
  - completed deals;
  - hot list;
  - EOL metrics.

Dave:

I want to be sure I am on the right track for providing you ,John and Kevin 
with meaningful account coverage data. I envision a one page 
summary that provides you with a monthly and quarterly sub-region coverage 
ratio. I propose that the quarterly coverage standard be set 
at 100%. The monthly coverage standard would be at least 50%. These standards 
would drive consistent, ongoing coverage of commercially 
active customers. Less active or inactive customers would be contacted at 
least once a quarter to determine status changes and propose 
product structures. This reporting format would also place emphasis on each 
commercial team's coverage effectiveness or lack thereof.  I will 
derive this summary from a master customer list that will show contact dates 
and specific comments on customer status. I anticipate this master 
list to be 20-25 pages. I propose to provide you a copy of the master list 
quarterly in order to corroborate the monthly summary. Do my proposed 
coverage standards and reporting format meet your expectations?

In addition, I have asked my commercial teams to prepare regional business 
plans by July 12. A primary component of these plans will be
identification of major new business initiatives by sub-region. Tammy 
Shepperd asked me to provide you with an initial report this week. I 
don't want to provide you with something "half-baked".  Is it acceptable to 
allow my commercial teams to complete their plans then provide
you with our suggested initiatives by July 13 ? 

Finally, I have provided Tammy with reports on 1st/2nd quarter completed 
transactions plus a deal flow "hot list" .

Sorry for being verbose. Please advise. 

Thanks,     Ed

Its really hard to tell how well we are doing with fundraising so far this 
year.  Kelly Trout tells me there is about $90,000.00 in the bank.  In 
addition, she has been told of a $10,000.00 donation and that other companies 
will be donating, although the exact amount is uncertain.  From my phone 
calls, it looks like there may be $20,000.00 -$40,000.00 out there that has 
not been received by Kelly.  I really hope that I am not being overly 
optimistic though.

Last year, I think we had about $140,000.00 in the bank on the night of the 
party and thought that we would raise a total of $150,000.  Somehow, after 
all of the donations came in, we received $165,000.00 in donations.   So, it 
may be that if I am estimating things correctly, we are on track.

If I am being overly optimistic, however, we have a lot of work to do.  
Please ensure that you follow-up on letters and make some last minute cold 
calls.  Its not too late.

I'm attaching a list of donors from the last 2 years.   The lists show names 
of donors who we have not yet received donations from this year, at least not 
to my knowledge.  Beside the donors are the names of the deputies who 
obtained the donations.  If your name is beside a company, please call the 
company to find out if they will match last year's donation (or exceed it), 
you may be surprised, they may have budgeted for this donation!  Also, even 
if your name is not beside a company, call these companies if you know people 
there.  The more phone calls, the more likely it is that we receive a 
donation!

Please keep up the hard work.  We want to meet our target!!!!

Also, email Kelly Trout at Kelly_Trout@Scotia-Mcleod.com any names of donors 
who have confirmed that they will donate, plus the anticipated amount of the 
donation.  We want to be able to know by Monday how close we are to our 
target -- so your communication with Kelly if important.

Thanks to everybody who is working so hard, but keep pushing yourself to get 
those extra donations.

Liz

PS  I just rented my costume on Thursday!!!  It got me pretty hyped about the 
party as I stood there trying on dresses and mile high white wigs!!!

Regarding the repairs that need to be done on your property, I will

of the vacation payment ($12,308.56) less $756.80 in tax.

And yes there are still some corporate tickets available to help close those
deals for donations !  Please call if you need them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Its really hard to tell how well we are doing with fundraising so far this
 year.  Kelly Trout tells me there is about $90,000.00 in the bank.  In
 addition, she has been told of a $10,000.00 donation and that other companies
 will be donating, although the exact amount is uncertain.  From my phone
 calls, it looks like there may be $20,000.00 -$40,000.00 out there that has
 not been received by Kelly.  I really hope that I am not being overly
 optimistic though.

Last year, I think we had about $140,000.00 in the bank on the night of the
 party and thought that we would raise a total of $150,000.  Somehow, after 
all
 of the donations came in, we received $165,000.00 in donations.   So, it may
 be that if I am estimating things correctly, we are on track.

If I am being overly optimistic, however, we have a lot of work to do.  Please
 ensure that you follow-up on letters and make some last minute cold calls.
 Its not too late.

I'm attaching a list of donors from the last 2 years.   The lists show names 
of
 donors who we have not yet received donations from this year, at least not to
 my knowledge.  Beside the donors are the names of the deputies who obtained
 the donations.  If your name is beside a company, please call the company to
 find out if they will match last year's donation (or exceed it), you may be
 surprised, they may have budgeted for this donation!  Also, even if your name
 is not beside a company, call these companies if you know people there.  The
 more phone calls, the more likely it is that we receive a donation!

Please keep up the hard work.  We want to meet our target!!!!

Also, email Kelly Trout at Kelly_Trout@Scotia-Mcleod.com any names of donors
 who have confirmed that they will donate, plus the anticipated amount of the
 donation.  We want to be able to know by Monday how close we are to our 
target
 -- so your communication with Kelly if important.

Thanks to everybody who is working so hard, but keep pushing yourself to get
 those extra donations.

Liz

PS  I just rented my costume on Thursday!!!  It got me pretty hyped about the
 party as I stood there trying on dresses and mile high white wigs!!!

Shelly,

I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.

Li was scheduled to meet with me last Thursday but  she never showed 
up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up.
I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Shelly, 

Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in 
Vince's group doing modelling, etc.  This will give her the broadest 
experience for a first rotation.  I'm sure the other person in question, 
Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group.  

Thanks for your help.

Can we put something into our trading system where it would stop us from 
entering a counterparty in if we were full on credit.  This could help the

I think we are making great progress on the systems side.  I would like to 
set a deadline of November 10th to have a plan on all North American projects 
(I'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by 
commercial, Sally's world, and Beth's world.  When I say signed off I mean 
that I want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the 
plan for each project.  If you don't agree don't sign. If certain projects 
(ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan 
will be complete.  I want much more in the way of specifics about objectives 
and timeframe.

Thanks for everyone's hard work on this.

John

We need the hourly data.  If they do not release it OPG has a significant 
advantage in a deregulating market.  Please push the issue.

Good morning,

I hope everyone has recovered from the party last Friday.  I think we 
definitely have maintained our 'best party of the year' status.  It was a 
great night!

To wrap everything up, we want to get the names of our donors to the Calgary 
Herald as soon as possible.  We are hoping to have the Herald run the full 
page ad showing our sponsors next SATURDAY.  That means that I need you to 
make any final phone calls to donors by the end of this week, Monday at the 
VERY LATEST.

Please send the names, money, etc. to Kelly.  If you have someone who is 
confirmed but will not donate until later, we will put them in the ad.

Kelly, Lauch, Sheila, Shannon/Micheline, Jim, Mike, Bill and Chris can 
confirm this, but I think we had about $225,000.00 in the bank the night of 
the party, we made about $5,000.00 on the balloons, $8,000.00 on the silent 
auction, $18,000.00 on the ticket sales and Sheila just received a large 
donation $10,000.00 (?) from CanOxy (I think).  So, it looks like we're at 
over $260,000.00 now.  Great job everyone.  It was really wonderful to be a 
part of such a successful night!

Thanks again for all your hard work, and get those names in to Kelly,

 Elizabeth Stock

John,

I wouldn't ordinarily send these past you but are you OK with below for 
Calgers guy in San Fran? The numbers seem ok given it is equity rather than 
cash.

Also - Let's leave out where they graduate to.  This might be an issue with

Subject: Credit Issue

We have finalized our P&L for Q3.  On the last day of the quarter we had 
about a half dozen deals that were closed that credit still had not given us 
a number for.  We were hit with credit reserves for three deals on the last 
day of the quarter.  These deals were done more than a month ago and credit 
materially changed some of the reserve numbers at the last minute.  We still 
have not received credit numbers from three deals that were done in Q3.  What 
level of service should I expect from credit?

The P&L is not yet done for yesterday.  Our risk group was here until 
midnight.  Our systems were not working right.

Please give me an update on the overall status of Chris Dorland relocation 
from Calgary to Houston.  As Lavo has already indicated to you, Chris will be 
joining the East Power Trading group as the PJM cash trader.  Chris is 
anxious to get the process rolling so he can make the transition to Houston 
no later than October 2, 2000.  In particular the following package needs to 
be put together and overnighted to Chris this week.

 1) Visa paperwork (Canada to US)
 2) Relocation specifics (move coordination & $'s for move)
 3) New US salary (Chris expectation is $80k/yr US)

Please give me an update as soon as possible.

Thanks David.

Jim

This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information. The only 
difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four 
Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) 
followed by one each year after that.  Your report says that all Pickering 
units would come back in 2001.  Even in your report, however, they seem 
doubtful that this is realistic.  The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead 
for a long time if not for good.

Regards,  John

P.S.  I'll call you soon on are project, currently on hold until 2001 if we 
decide to build in Ontario.

Subject: TDC Energy

I need to make you aware of a potential lawsuit we may be filing jointly with 
Columbia Energy Services/Nisource against TDC Energy regarding a CES 
transaction.  I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in 
because this is moving quite quickly.

TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with 
CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions 
were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing 
the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for 
them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' 
exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is 
approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue 
and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file 
the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're 
interested and explain the reasons for this.

In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with 
TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   
TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; 
however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go 
bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, 
plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  
Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we 
should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted 
and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through 
this.

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

Thanks for your memo outlining your positions and strategies.  It was very 
helpful for me to understand your thought process which seems very sound.

I hope to spend more time with you guys in the future.  I am also working on 
the human resource issues you mentioned.

The PPA auction is going along well I think.  We are leading on Sundance B 
and have been for 3 rounds now.  Some weird things are occuring so it is too 
early to tell what will utimately happen.  The government has said that it 
will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning.  We 
would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on Sundance B.  
Currently we are bid  $112,000,000 Canadian and a swap price of 33.5 CAD.  
But again its too early to get our hopes up.

Attached is some very preliminary correlation work that Joe Hrgovcic did on 
understanding the dependence of PJM consumption/demand on a basket of 
temperatures.  As you will see from the spread sheet Joe was able to get a 
correlation of 97.7%.

Should you have any questions on the analytical work Joe's phone number is 
33914 and mine is 37480.  Both Joe and I have spoken with Vince about this 
idea. We on the weather desk are interested pushing this idea forward with 
your support.

Subject: N.A. Systems



I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin

Despite my veto eBiz decided to publish something on California energy 
prices.  I think Palmer overrulled me.  He said that the article was harmless 
but I still think it is stupid for us to be writing articles about this.

Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the "Executive Impact &

"peer/other" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that 
all feedback be submitted.  

I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt 
of the feedback forms.

Many Thanks,

Barry,

FYI the California QF's are negotiating a settlement deal with Edison and the 
state of California which would fix energy payments over five years.  
Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority 
of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will 
likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent 
about 500MMCF/Day of gas.

Subject: Alberta Power Purchase Arrangement Auction

I have considered on a preliminary basis the potential use of a limited 
liability subsidiary of Enron Canada Corp. for the purposes of bidding on the 
PPAs.  The issues and preliminary answers are in summary the following:

1. It is not clear that Alberta would permit qualification of another Enron 
Canada entity at this point.  I believe that it would be more sellable if 
that Enron Canada entity was a replacement to Enron Canada as a Qualified 
Bidder, rather than an additional Qualified Bidder, and if that Enron Canada 
entity was similarly guaranteed by Enron Corp.  I need to discuss this matter 
further with Rob Hemstock, Alberta and Charles River.

2. With respect to the Enron Corp. Guarantee, as mentioned, it is not free 
from doubt, but I believe that the Guarantee is only in respect of bidding 
on, and paying for a PPA and not for ongoing performance or payment 
obligations under the PPA.  In other words, the Guarantee guarantees 
"Obligations" which relate to the bidding process and not to the PPAs 
themselves, although there is some wording which could be viewed as including 
in "Obligations" ongoing obligations with respect to the PPAs themselves.

3. With respect to limiting liability, such Enron Canada entity would limit 
exposure for a successfully acquired PPA to the contributed capital to such 
Enron Canada entity, assuming the Enron Corp. Guarantee would not extend past 
the bidding process as noted in paragraph 2 above, and subject to the common 
law relating to "piercing the corporate veil", which in essence means that 
the limited liability protection of a shareholder through a corporate entity 
can be looked through if the courts determine that the corporate entity was 
established merely for the purposes of avoiding liabilities properly 
attributable to the shareholder.  Although this is a difficult test to prove 
given the intended purposes of corporate and other limited liability 
entities, it is best to establish the limited liability entity in such a way 
that it has the greatest appearance of an operating company (for example, a 
separate board of directors, separate management, separate employees, 
separate operating agreements and leases, etc.).  As mentioned, however, it 
is all a matter of degree and generally speaking it is difficult to establish 
a case where the courts will allow the "corporate veil" protecting 
shareholders to be "pierced".

4. With respect to capturing tax losses incurred in the limited liability 
entity, if Enron Canada is the sole shareholder so that there is no change of 
control on a winding-up into Enron Canada, Enron Canada can avail of tax 
losses incurred in the Enron Canada entity through a winding-up.  Obviously, 
however, this would mean that Enron Canada takes on the liabilities of the 
special purpose entity as a result of the winding-up, including the 
liabilities for any acquired PPA.  Otherwise, the general rule is that the 
tax losses, if any, would be captured inside in the Enron Canada entity and 
would not be available to be used against Enron Canada's taxable income.

5. With respect to Project Stanley, there is really no established case 
authority directly on point, but the better view is that any sanction, if and 
when imposed on Enron Canada, would be imposed in a way that would prevent 
Enron Canada from indirectly avoiding the application of the sanction, such 
as by moving certain business operations into a special purpose entity.  In 
other words, if Canada or Alberta were intent on suspending or affecting 
Enron Canada's abilities to transact through the PPAs or otherwise in the 
Alberta Power Pool, it is likely that the sanction would be imposed upon 
Enron Canada and its affiliated entities also transacting through the Power 
Pool.

Based upon the preliminary answers, please let me know if you want a more 
detailed legal opinion to consider these issues further and whether Hemstock 
and I should be approaching the Government to qualify a special purpose 
entity.

Regards, Peter

Lavo tells me this guy needs to leave but apparently there is some debate 
about him staying?

Can you tell me:

Where he is  HE WORKS IN M&A.  CURRENTLY HE IS HELPING WITH THE SALE OF THE 
GAS BUS. UNIT.  CLOSELY WORKS  WITH BAXTER BUT ACTUALLY REPORTS TO KISHKILL.  
WE TOLD HIM BACK IN DECEMBER THAT HE NEEDED TO REPATRIATE AT THE END OF THE 
MONTH (JAN).  HE WENT ON VACATION AND NOW HE IS OUT SICK.  HE TOLD US THAT HE 
IS COMING BACK TO THE OFFICE NEXT WEEK.  I'LL BE TALKING TO HIM ON THE 
REPATRIATION AND JOE ON HIS PERFORMANCE (WE RATED HIM ISSUES BUT AT THE 
GLOBAL VP PRC IT WAS CHANGED TO NEEDS IMPROVEMENT).  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING 
THAT HE IS GETTING A JOB WORKING AT EBS.  THAT IS THE LAST COMMUNICATION WE 
HAVE (INITIALLY BAXTER WANTED HIM).   BASED ON THE INTEREST FROM BAXTER AND 
OTHERS WE PLACED HIM ON THE TRANSITION LIST BUT WE WANT HIM OUT AS OF THE END 
OF THE MONTH.  LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFO.  MP
Who he works for
What issue is
etc.,

John,

FYI Clickpaper should be up and running by the end of the month.  We will be 
quoting mostly the same products as we currently do in EOL (except longer 
term and one new physical offering).  We will also continue to make quotes on 
EOL but probably with a wider spread.

Some newsprint stuff for you.  As with any other commodity, the inventories 
and operating rate/capacity are the key drivers.

Hi, Tony Borelli the recruiting writer here. (the guy you just talked to)

Below I've pasted the text of your brief interview/profile blurb for the
Enron recruiting web site. It consists of a main section and a short
"callout quote" to be set apart from it, maybe in a different typeface.

Please review it ASAP, and reply to this email, either approving it as is
(which I would love) or listing any changes that I need to make. NOTE:
Please list any changes separately, rather than editing the text directly.

I ask that you focus on looking for any errors of fact, revelations of
proprietary information, statements that will genuinely make someone look
bad, or other such serious problems.

The informal style and tone, the general content, and the length have all
been predetermined, and they need to match all the other blurbs we're doing
for the site. So I'd ask that you not focus on those issues or change those
parameters, and that you avoid doing any wholesale rewriting unless you
think it's absolutely unavoidable.

Please be brave! Keep in mind that whole platoons of Enron communications
and legal specialists will review and edit everything carefully before the
public ever sees it. And of course, since this will appear only in web
format, even after it "goes live" it will never really be permanent.

Thanks for all your help!
--Tony
TEXT IS BELOW:


John Lavorato
Managing Director (trading and risk management)
Enron North America

I started in Calgary in 1995, building our Canadian natural gas and
electrical power trading operation from scratch, and I left as president. It
was absolutely awesome. I had the time of my life. I hired the people I
wanted, with very little supervision, back when gas and power trading was in
its infancy, and today we're the biggest market maker and risk manager
there. These days, as many people know, we're using that same expertise to
create liquid markets in many other products, from broadband capacity to
paper pulp. So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in
Canada-to help build revolutionary new businesses.

But what some people might not realize is that even in our established gas
and power trading operations-where we're by far the dominant player-it's
hugely interesting and complicated, with a million variables to figure out,
from the weather to the available storage capacity in Montana. You can't
ship natural gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like
other commodities. And it's not like trading bonds, where you sit around
waiting for the Fed. If you like solving incredibly complex problems, and
you're very good at it ... get down here! We need you!


<JOHN'S CALLOUT QUOTE>
Enron's not a place where you can hide-or where you'll be hidden. If you
can't get it done, you won't fit in. But if you can, and you work hard,
you'll get noticed, you'll excel, you'll get paid, and we're going to love
you.

We are moving forward to transfer the positions from the emissions books (SO2 
and NOx) to the coal group at close of business 5/23/00.  The SO2 marks for 
both the underlying and volatility positions currently in the 2007 through 
2010 timeframe create a value differential of $2.6 million between our 
evaluation and their marks.  For the sake of not continuing the unproductive 
task of negotiating this value, we will move forward to transfer despite our 
differences.

I strongly recommend continuing to use and pay for all personnel in risk, 
documentation and settlement that currently perform these duties for 
emissions. 
I would like to utilize these resources until further notice.  I am not 
comfortable committing to any transfer of risk, documentation and settlement 
duties until we have the time to evaluate this further.  I would appreciate 
if you could help on this matter to ensure a smooth transition.

Attached is an e-mail Aleck got from Seabron Adamson who is an 
economist/consultant with Frontier Economics that Aleck has recently used in 
Ontario.  Seabron use to work at London Economics and was the author the of 
January 1998 London Economics Report that was commissioned by the Government 
of Alberta to assess market power in Alberta and develop alternatives options 
for the mitigation of market power in the Alberta Power Pool.  The idea of 
the PPA Model was first introduced/described in Seabron's Report and his 
ideas formed the basis of what has ultimately been developed into the PPA 
Model we have today.  

It looks like Seabron is available to help you out if you need him.  Aleck 
has his phone number, etc.

Dear Aleck and Paul:

Any news from the OEB?

Do you guys have any interest in the Alberta PPA auction process? We saw
that Enron was listed on the website. As you know Kevin and I played a role
in designing the thing and have also done some modeling work on looking at
the contract packages.

I will not accept Amerex having the ability to execute over the phone.  Take 
this out of the deal or kill the deal.

John,

As of 6/15 the value in the ICAP curve was $79MM.
I have executed bilateral trades creating $3MM of New Deal value in my book.
There is now $65MM of value left in the curve.
$11MM has been spent in hedges.

FYI

We've interviewed this guy before and had no interest then, have no interest 
now, and won't in the future.  I think he is trying to get in the door again 
somehow.

August 1, 2000
Mr. Jeff Shankman
Enron North America
Houston, Texas
Jshankm@enron.com
Regarding: positions in natural gas trading

Dear Mr. Shankman:

I  am  writing to inquire about positions in natural gas trading with Enron
North  America.   I  have been working with EOTT Energy Corporation for the
last  four  months on a temporary basis on a project involving setting up a
profit/loss  report  for  the  various regions within the United States for
EOTT's  crude  oil trading and marketing business.  Previously, I worked in
the  energy  industry  for  over  two  years  in  trading, risk management,
structured  products  and  marketing of electricity and natural gas for the
western  United  States.   Additionally,  I  was  actively  involved in the
physical  markets  and  gained  a strong understanding of the western grid.
Furthermore,  I am an expert in options trading and have a strong knowledge
of the commodity and financial markets.  Moreover, I have also traded NYMEX
natural  gas  futures,  options  on futures, forward contracts for physical
power  and  options  in  SERC, SPP, MAAC, MAIN, ECAR and ERCOT.  Finally, I
have  had  experience  setting  up/operating  market  simulation models and
maintaining the underlying databases for fixed income securities.  Prior to
entering the energy markets, I worked as the senior trader/risk manager for
Mellon  Mortgage  Company  in  Houston,  Texas.   At  Mellon,  I positively
affected  the  bottom  line  performance  of the company for over two years
through  strategic  trading  and  hedging of mortgage backed securities.  I
received the Premier Achievement Award from the Chief Executive Officer for
outstanding  financial  performance  and  the  Employee  Choice  Award from
co-workers for my tenacity and diligence in work.  My expertise with listed
futures  and  options  on  futures,  OTC  options and swaps, as well as the
ability  to  positively  affect  the  bottom  line could definitely make an
impact  with  your  team.   In addition, my competitive and entrepreneurial
personality  allows  me to constantly look for profitable solutions or cost
effective ways of managing risk.

As  you  will  note  from  the  enclosed  resume, I managed the trading and
hedging  of  the  interest  rate risk on mortgage loans for Mellon Mortgage
Company.   The  interest  rate risk was managed by use of forward sales and
purchases  of  mortgage backed securities, put and call options on mortgage
backed securities, and 10 year CMT Index floors.  In addition,  futures and
options on futures on U.S. Government Treasury notes and bonds were used at
the  appropriate  time  taking into account the basis between mortgages and
treasuries.   Previously,   I worked for The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
in  New York as a proprietary trader in fixed income. Earlier, I worked for
Garvin  Guybutler  Corporation,  a  major  international  money and deposit
broker.    Primary  responsibilities  at  Garvin  included  uncovering  and
executing  arbitrage EuroDeposit transactions in order to enhance placement
yields   and   reduce   borrowing  costs  relative  to  Eurodollar  deposit
transactions  of  similar  maturities.   In addition, I was involved in the
brokering   of   Term  Federal  Funds,  EuroDollar  deposits,  EuroCurrency
deposits, Interest Rate Swaps and Forward Rate Agreements.

It  would be my pleasure to discuss these qualifications with you and learn
more  about  positions  in  natural  gas  trading with Enron North America.
Please contact me so we can talk about possible opportunities.

Thank you,

Rick J. Wurlitzer

Thank you very much for your support of me and Enron in the annual Summer 
Stroll for Epilepsy.   The event took place this past Saturday and was a lot 
of fun.  Your generous donation of $50 enabled me to pass my personal goal of 
$3,000 by $65. Thank you!!

We have been asked to collect the money by Friday, May 19, so if you will 
call me once your check is ready, I will be glad to pick it up.  Please make 
your check payable to the Epilepsy Foundation.  Thank you again for your 
donation and support!

You know, when the accountant does the spreadsheet, it looks exactly right.  
The numbers I sent you were pulled out of context of the big picture - I need 
to re-do that (again!) for Jane's letter.  However, what you were paid is 
correct (except for the gross up on the vacation pay which we still owe 
you).  Laura says this will make complete sense when you see her spreadsheet 
and I believe her.....

David

I'm going to extend and offer to someone who currently works at Koch.  I will 
extend the offer at the Director level but this person could easily pass as a 
Vice President.  I think I need to add some stock or options to the offer.  
Can you please advise me on how I can accomplish this.

Thanks

John Lavorato

John, I thought I would send you a note to outline our conversation re. David 
Redmond.  Dave will return to the London office in late May.  In late 
February we will pinpoint the group/job that will best suit Dave and Enron.  
All  efforts will be made to get Dave an option trading related position.

Regards


John Lavorato

A couple of points and questions:

1)   Is the EIP position going to get traced on the DPR - because this has 
gotten fouled up in the past
2)   Can we be more explicit on what constitutes the Capital Portfolio - I 
think there has been
       confusion on what is here as well.
3)  Also why not show if Lavo or I have the overview role.  For example now 
that LNG has moved under Shankman
      Lavo should take the oversight role rather than me.

John

Gentlemen (and I use the term loosely!):
Now that you have been duly authorized by the COO and CRO of Enron to have 
global risk responsibility, you need to authorize the individual responsible 
for each individual commodity group delineated in the Risk Management 
Policy.  I took the liberty of making a stab at it for you.  Please review 
attachment and let me know if you have  any changes.  If ok, I will forward 
to you for your signature and on to Rick Buy to make official.  These 
individuals will then be responsible for designating those that can transact 
on their behalf.  
Any questions, please call me asap.

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

John  Thanks for the update.  I found out after we talked that there were 
also several expense account related problems, which will not happen under 
our responsabilty.

On Ed Graham.

I pushed the issue with Cliff and Kevin Hannon.

Kevin, Cliff and Jeff Donanue (current head of M&A for Broadband) met on the 
issue after I talked to them.  They have decided to give him 6 months to 
perform or he will be let go.  His bonus for 2000 will be 0. 

I know you wanted a different outcome but this is the best I could do.

John

John,

I am interested in a power options trading position at Enron.  I have a track
record of profitable options trading and market-making in illiquid markets,

structured products for customers.  I attach my resume for your review and
would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and background
with you in person.  I can be reached at 214-812-8560 during the day and
214-891-1705 in the evening.

Regards,

Manu

Subject: Memo re Ontario/Alberta power markets

John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.

My regulatory lawyers wrote a biief update of the Canadian Power market.  If 
you have any questions please give me a call.

I would like to request a temporary increase of the Natural Gas var limit for 
the next 10 business days.  I suggest Natural Gas Trading's limit increase to 
45 Million limit from the current 40 Million limit.  The floor is very 
bullish and we don't want to take off our West Basis positions which are 
eating up a lot of var.

Please advise.

Subject: Final Associate/Analyst 2000 PRC - Jacoby

PRC Representatives
Thank you for your participation in the year-end 2000 PRC.  Listed below are 
the Associates/Analysts you will be representing:



As you may know, the final PRC will be conducted on December 12th (Analysts) 
and December 13th (Associates).  Your participation in these meetings is 
essential.  Prior to that date, each business unit has been asked to conduct 
a pre-rating meeting to determine each employee's pre-rating.  The 
pre-ratings will be loaded into the PEP system.  The PEP system is open and 
available for employees to select reviewers.  You have been listed as a 
secondary supervisor so that you may review each of your Associates/Analysts 
feedback.  You are responsible for contacting the Supervisor and/or 
Associates/Analysts to discuss and obtain valuable performance information.  
The Associate and Analyst Programs will also provide you with a copy of the 
completed feedback for each of the people you represent once the PEP system 
is closed.  The more information that you can secure regarding your 
Associates/Analysts will ensure that each person is cross-calibrated 
correctly at the final PRC.  If you are a new PRC Representative and are 
unsure of the process, please contact either Jana Giovannini at x3-9233 or 
Shelly Butler at x3-4584 with any questions.

Supervisors
You should approve/add/delete the reviewers selected by the 
Associates/Analysts that work in your group.  You should then consolidate 
this feedback including your over-all thoughts, which should be presented at 
your business unit pre-rating meeting.  If your business unit is not 
conducting a pre-rating meeting due to it's size, please make sure that the 
rating you provide is loaded into the PEP system prior to the final PRC.  
Please contact the PEP help desk at x3-4777 option 4 or Terry Bosien at 
x3-5230 if you are unable to load this data yourself.  You should wait to 
provide feedback to your Associates/Analysts until the final decisions have 
been made to avoid any confusion.  All pre-ratings are subject to the final 
cross-calibration and may change in the final PRC meeting.  You are 
responsible for contacting the PRC Representative listed above whom will be 
representing your Associates/Analysts prior to the final PRC.  Keep in mind 
that the more information you can provide, either verbal or written, will 
ensure that the final PRC is a success.

Associates/Analysts
You are responsible for selecting your reviewers.  You should have received 
your logon ID and password from the PEP team.  If you have not received this, 
please contact x3-4777 option 4 with questions.  Please go into the system 
and select your reviewers.  Your direct supervisor may let you know how many 
people to select and will be ultimately responsible for approving your 
reviewers.  Remember that it is important to select a broad range of 
reviewers that include internal/external customers at any level.  You will 
also be asked to complete feedback on yourself.  Be sure to take the 
opportunity to detail your accomplishments and specific ways in which you 
have added value to your unit.  This is your chance to be heard.  You may 
hear from your PRC Rep to discuss your roles and responsibilities.  If you do 
not, we suggest that you contact them either verbally or in writing.  

An Enfo-session regarding the PRC is being held at 3:30pm on November 1, 2000 
at the Doubletree Hotel, La Salle Ballroom A for all Associates and 
Analysts.  We encourage you to attend.  Final PRC results should be 
communicated to the Supervisor by 12/31/00.  The feedback should be 
communicated to the Associates/Analysts by 1/15/01.  If the 
Associates/Analysts have not received feedback by the deadline, they should 
contact their Career Development Manager (Jana Giovannini x3-9233 or Shelly 
Butler x3-4584).  Thank you for your cooperation and we look forward to a 
successful final PRC

If you bring Dina some cheesey (spelling) 80's movie on DVD like "16 Candles" 
she would be in heaven.  We got a crazy cold spell last week but it should be 
gone when you come.  In case you guys want to go to a nice place to eat you 
might want to bring some casual pants but for the most part jeans should be 
fine.

I am working with CIBC on another credit mitigation deal.  They are 
interested but they have said nothing yet on pricing levels.  I am sending 
them something on Monday that will propose a Enron payment on Friday December 
17th of approximately $16 MM CAD.   Again, this payment would come from the 
U.S. office so if there are any administrative things that need to get done I 
suggest we get on it quickly.  I assume Juanita needs to deal with funding 
and Louie needs to secure a letter from CIBC re credit mitigation.  I'm in 
Houston part of the week but you can track me done through my secretary.  

Regards

I just realized that you do have "financial desk excluding futures" on report.

Get rid of the other "financial desk" and when you aggregate it exclude the 
futures trades.

Thanks

This memo follows up on our discussion this morning.

With respect to the 15 million of increased VAR that the Board allocated to 
Rick Buy and Jeff Skilling I propose the following:

1.  5 Million be allocated to EES and therefore remove EES's positions from 
the Wholesale gas and power groups (This has already been done).

2.  Move the control and decision making of 5 Million of VAR each to the 
trading heads of North America (Lavorato) and Europe (Sherriff).

3.  With respect to North America I intend to create a group called the 
"Cross Commodity Trading Group" which will warehouse the 5 Million of VAR and 
use it as it sees fit (I will run this group and currently be the only 
employee).  This will start out as an administrative structure to use if we 
need to throw more VAR at certain positions (I see the individual trading 
groups staying within their VAR limits).  However, I do see the need for a 
true cross commodity group that would search for low risk / high probability 
trades accross the commodities that we trade.  This structure may help to 
start us down this path.

Please let me know what you think.

John

On Ed Graham.

I pushed the issue with Cliff and Kevin Hannon.

Kevin, Cliff and Jeff Donanue (current head of M&A for Broadband) met on the 
issue after I talked to them.  They have decided to give him 6 months to 
perform or he will be let go.  His bonus for 2000 will be 0. 

I know you wanted a different outcome but this is the best I could do.

Hi John, I hope all is going well.  I have heard lots of great things about
your on-line system.  I hope it is going well on your end.

I just wanted to touch base with you to see how you are doing with the
fundraising.  I find it a very humbling process asking people for money.
You should hit up Chris at Koch :)

I don't know why this is coming up now and why we don't address this at year 
end in conjunction with the PRC process.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=
=20
to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=
ver=20
EWS reporting in addition to his current role in North America.

Attached for your review is an organization chart for Enron Wholesale=20
Services which summarizes the changes described here.  As this organization=
=20
continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes.

ENRON GLOBAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
AND ENRON WIND

 As part of our company-wide initiative to examine our assets and investmen=
ts=20
around the world, we are considering a variety of options with respect to=
=20
EGEP and EWC.  As a consequence, we are putting these businesses under Clif=
f=20
Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=
nron=20
Wind, will report to Cliff.

CORPORATE STAFF

 We are consolidating the corporate staff functions: Human Resources,=20
Government Affairs, Public Relations/Communications and Administration.  In=
=20
that regard, Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President of Human Resources and=
=20
Community Relations, will report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President an=
d=20
Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=
=20
growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=
=20
be the communication of relevant information across Enron=01,s businesses a=
nd=20
the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20
drawing on this group to lead company-wide initiatives such as the=20
performance review process and evaluation and creation of new businesses. =
=20
The Executive Committee membership is shown on the attached list.

 We are also forming a new committee =01) the Enron Corporate Policy Commit=
tee. =20
This group will be responsible for overall corporate policy, personnel=20
management policy and corporate strategy.  The Enron Corporate Policy=20
Committee membership is also shown on the attached list.

 We are confident that these changes will align our talent and our capital =
to=20
our highest return opportunities.  Please join us in congratulating and=20
supporting all of these individuals in their new roles.

By now everyone should have received Kelly's email -- reporting our current 
fundraising tally to be over $176,000.00!!  Well done everybody.  I couldn't 
believe my eyes this morning when I saw Kelly's email.

This is a great day to be a member of the Order of Good Cheer!!!!

But, don't stop there.  Keep up the hard work, because there is no reason why 
we shouldn't be striving for $200,000.00 now.  Afterall, the last 3 years we 
have blown our targets out of the water.  It would be great to report that we 
have doubled our official target of $100,000.00!!!!!

Kelly tells me that even more cheques have arrived today and that she has 
been hearing from lots of you with corrections.  Brian Boulanger and Kelly

Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan 
under the following  conditions.

1 -  Volumes will not fall.  In fact they will increase.

2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then 
East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,

3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.

4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer 
pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not 
keeping.

Give me a call if there are any issues.

The ERCOT team has met with Joe Des Champs for the Mid Marketing position in 
our region.  It is my understanding that you must interview Joe before we can 
make him a job offer.  I would like to proceed with the interview process.  
Joe worked for me at Williams as the lead trader in the West.  Here are my 
thoughts on Joe and why he is a good fit for our group.

1.  He has a very good understanding of the trading business, especially 
natural gas in Texas and the western US.
2.  His personality is a great fit for Texas (especially with the loss of Jim 
Ducote).  Joe has a lot of successful relationships within Texas and relates 
well to Texans.  His initial appearance and manners appear to be easy going 
and laid back, however he is a very agressive and effective trader.  His 
command of the physical gas business is outstanding.
3.  Learns fast and relates well to traders.  I believe Doug and Joe will 
work well together.
4.  Likes to work the phones.

What he is not:
1.  He is new to the power business.  However, he served the Williams/AES 
plants in California.  So he is familiar with the power.

I would be glad to discuss Joe in detail or set up the phone interview.  I 
have attached Joe's resume.  Thanks.

Hello again everyone.  One last structure pre-christmas.  I'm am working on 
an option structure with TD bank that would see 20,000,000 CAD go out the 
door on Wednesday December 22nd or Thursday December 23rd.  There will be no 
special documentation necessary, only standard option confirmations.  The 
money will return equally over the 12 months of 2000.  TD is charging us a 
fee of 50K CAD for the idea but since it is different than the deals we have 
already done I'm OK with it.  What I need is the following.

1 -  If there are any questions or concerns please call me early Monday 
morning.

2 - Jordon - Please call me and give me your OK.

3.  Juanita - Let me know if you can handle the payment in time.

4.  Joe - How's are Line of Credit coming - we're running out of time.

Thanks 

John Lavorato

Happy New Year!!

1.    A couple of things on fundraising:

PPPPLLLEASE send your cheques to Michael Leahy with the attached form 
correctly filled out.  DO NOT send to Enviros.  The reason for this is that 
we need to keep records so that we can prepare the list of donors for the 
Brochure, the newspaper ad and the thank-you letters.

Keep up the hard work on getting donations.  Let me know if you need other 
information, such as Michael's address (see attachment), tax info, more 
brochures, flow through share donation infor, etc. etc.

Subject: Memo re Ontario/Alberta power markets

John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.

We actually forced Craig Breslau and Fred Lagrasta to unwind an unapproved 
one year trade with their subsidiary Savannah Foods in April 2000.  In 
hindsight, it appears to be quite a good call.

  Holly Sugar Corporation


At the present, we have no trades with either of these counterparties.

SEABROOK P&L
Booking the 200 MW Seabrook position through for calender 2001 results in a 
positive $23.5 million.

For background purposes, UI has a 17.5% ownership interest in the Seabrook 
nuclear facility (total facility is 1142 MW).   The other owners of Seabrook 
are as follows:
  Northeast Utilities 40% (they are driving the sale - it is a condition on 
their Con-Ed merger)
  Great Bay Power  12% (they have announced their intention on selling)
  New England Power 10%
  Other minority owners 20% (8 small minority municipal & IOU owners)

The Seabrook facility has been on the auction block for the past 6-9 months, 
and given the uncertainty of the timing of the sale, Dana & I felt it was 
imprudent to book calender year 2001 until we knew with certainty that the 
plant asset transfer (and associated state, NRC and FERC approvals) would 
occur after 2002.  Remember contractually, EPMI's 200 MW PPA position 
terminates upon final closure of a UI sale of its 17% interest.   With 
respect to Millstone, Pilgrim and Maine Yankee nuclear asset sales, the 
majority owner drives the sale process and minority owners generally almost 
always sell their interest at the same price as the majority owner.   With 
respect to UI's 17.5%  interest in Seabrook, UI has already informed us they 
intend on selling their interest along with the majority owner.

Obviously, the plant has not yet been sold and I feel comfortable (given a 
10-12 month approval process coupled with Seabrook's politically sensitive 
location in New Hampshire) booking the 200 MW position through 2001.

ICAP P&L
Given the huge regulatory uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of ICAP 
in NE,  Dana is uncomfortable taking any of the $55 million to income at this 
time.   Basically, our opinion is that the regulatory decision will either 
result in a default price of $0.50-1.00/kW/Mo (resulting in approx $20-30 
million postive P&L) or a default price of $3-3.50/kW/Mo (loss of $20-30 
million).

The ICAP decision has once again been removed from the FERC agenda for next 
Wednesday's meeting.   This is the 3rd time that has happened in the past 2 
months and indicates a lack of consensus at FERC.   Given this FERC 
indecisiveness and the current situation in California and reliability issues 
in both the Western and Eastern US in general,  I am very concerned that FERC 
does not have the political guts to pull the plug on ICAP (or lower the 
default price to low penalty rate).

Given this regulatory situation, there is a 50/50 chance we lose additional 
money and a 50/50 chance we make additional money.   Said another way, we 
would likely use the entire $55 million in ICAP $'s to completely hedge ICAP 
through the term of UI.

In addiiton, there was a FERC ruling regarding PJM ICAP today that said 
$4.00+/kW/Mo for PJM ICAP was indeed market based and not market 
manipulated.  This coupled with FERC's lack of decision for 3+ months on NE 
ICAP makes us very uncomfortable.   The good news is we are not short PJM 
ICAP.

I said at yesterday's meeting that I would get back to you concerning the 
speed issues of the V@R calculations - here's the response...

I spoke with Steve Stock, the Director of RAC systems.  He agreed that there 
are performance problems and this is being addressed in a technology review 
being conducted by my application architecture group.  There are plans to 
re-architect the application so it can handle real time calculations.  Once 
the results of the review are known - I will be more than happy to share them 
with you.  The V@R process currently takes 11 hours from start to finish.  We 
also find this unacceptable!

Also, the front end is very slow in accessing data.  There is a new front end 
in development that will address these problems.

I'll keep you posted as new developments occur.

The incremental financing cost, by my calculation is less than 100,000 and it 
was determined to be prudent in light of ENA's interest in keeping these 
off-balance sheet, regardless of their use in Canada or the US.  My estimate 
is based on 26MM balance, four month average duration (staggered payments), 
6% interest rate and 15% withholding tax.  Matt Berry of ENA Finance and 
Morris Clark were part of our discussion on this matter.  The reason that we 
do not look at it over an extended term is becasue this West LB structure was 
put in place as a bridge until Enron determined if the machines were to be 
used in Canada or the US.  At that time Enron would put in place either a 
Canadian or US permanent structure that would be more tax-efficient.

I am available to talk about this further.  Let me know.

Subject: WestLB Transaction

John, the attached is a summary by Greg of the financining for the turbines 
purchased from New Brunswick Power.

In summary, ECC pays the bank, West LB directly in three installments under 
an off-balance sheet lease financing arrangement.  The first installment of 
$US 9MM was made Dec. 1/99.  The next installment is due Feb. 1/00 of $US 
8MM, and the third installment is due roughly March 31/00 of $US 8MM. The 
"drag" on the financing is that West LB through whom ENA structures its 
off-balance sheet turbine financings is not a Canadian resident for tax 
purposes, and therefore is not tax efficient to ECC in that there is a 15% 
withholding tax payment on the interest (not principal) component of each 
lease/financing payment.  An off-balance sheet financing with a Canadian 
resident financial institution would eliminate this tax inefficiency, and 
this is what I was referring to when I indicated some work may still be 
required to restructure the turbine financing.  The withholding tax if we 
keep this structure will total roughly C$ 500,000 over all of the 
lease/financing payments (Chris Calger has the exact figure).  Any decision 
to change the structure should have regard to these costs and the transaction 
costs and fees associated with finding a new Canadian resident off-balance 
sheet lender.  In addition, if we decide to keep the turbines, or sell or 
transfer the turbines to ENA or a third party (depending on commercially what 
it is we decide to do with them), additional work may be required to take 
title to the turbines, or to assign/restructure the West LB financing and the 
New Brunswick Power purchase agreement.  I am confident that the bulk of 
commercial legal work for any of these transactions can be handled 
internally, but that the tax legal work may require the input of outside 
counsel.

We are also obligated to pay GST, but this is ultimately reimbursed through 
the lease financing (althoguh there is a time value of money component that 
is not recovered from the time GST is paid and when the GST rebate is made).

Subject: WestLB Transaction

Peter, referring to your request for an update as to the status and mechanics 
of the West LB transaction relating to our acquisition of the NB Power 
turbines, please be advised as follows:

1.  Although ENA executed the Acquisition and Development Agreement (the 
"Agreement") with WestLB, all of ENA's interest in that Agreement was 
immediately assigned to Enron Canada, meaning that we are directly 
responsible for making all funding requests and all cost of borrowing 
payments to WestLB.

2.  The initial payment on the turbines was made through WestLB for an amount 
of US$9,000,000 on December 1, 1999.  GST was payable on US$5,000,000 of that 
amount.

3.  The next installment is due to NB Power on February 1, 2000 and is for an 
amount of US$8,000,000.  Laura Scott will be initiating the funding request 
in the next day or so to allow the advance to be a LIBOR advance.  WestLB 
will then attend to paying the installment payment (plus GST) to NB Power on 
Feb 1.

4.  The final installment payment is for an amount of US$8,000,000 and is due 
on the earlier of the date on which we commence disassembling the turbines 
and March 31, 2000.

5.  The cost to Enron Canada for utilizing WestLB, who is not registered in 
Canada to carry on business, is that we are required to pay withholding tax 
of 15% on all costs of borrowing (ie. interest payments).  The interest is 
calculated at a LIBOR rate.

6.  WestLB has now registered themselves in Canada for GST purposes and will 
be making the required GST payments to NB Power and then applying for the GST 
rebate, which rebate amount is for our account under the Agreement.

7.  WestLB is aware that, depending on how we proceed with our required use 
of the turbines, they will be taken out either with respect to (i) the 
interim financing or, if the interim financing period is short (ie. if we 
were going to proceed immediately to finish paying for the turbines and 
commence moving them), (ii) when we put the SPV in place to build the 
project.  

8.  If we determine that the turbines are to go to Houston and be moved into 
the US, the withholding tax issue obviously disappears.  If we determine to 
proceed with the project in some fashion but the interim financing period 
will be more than a month or so, it probably makes sense to remove WestLB 
from the interim financing, thereby saving ourselves the cost of the 
withholding tax.  One potential fix is to bring in a Canadian bank to act as 
funding agent, with WestLB continuing to bear the transactional risk, which 
could reduce the cost to us of getting a new bank comfortable with the 
financing arrangement.  We have not yet canvassed all the possible solutions, 
so I have not thought through to the full extent whether this proposal is 
viable.

I think that you are aware of the reasons that the determination was made to 
proceed with WestLB despite the withholding tax issue, but if you would like 
to discuss this any further or if there is anything else you would like to 
discuss, I am happy to do so.  

Greg

I asked about loss limits a couple months ago and Ted said that they no 
longer report these numbers to the board. However, I think we should get rid 
of the whole concept.  VAR is the relevant concept.

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its "Safety First" culture and track
record of commercial success.

Also can you make sure that I have a computer set up for me in Portland and 
Calgary and that it gets me into my network.  I especially need to be able to 
get into the executive reports.

Inn at Spanish Bay for 4 guests arriving Thursday, March 8, 2001 departing 
Sunday, March 11, 2001.  There is a minimum of a two night stay but you can 
use any combination within these dates.  Ocean View room rate is 
$525.00/person/night.

Golf Availability:
Links at Spanish Bay - Friday, March 9 at 7:20 a.m. - Golf Fee $185.00/pp 
includes 2 carts
Pebble Beach Golf Links - Saturday, March 10 at 12:00 p.m. - Golf Fee 
$300.00/pp includes 2 carts

$225.00/pp includes 2 carts
(Please note:  Only these courses and these tee times are available to play 
on these dates.)

If you are not planning to stay on property, tee times can only be reserved 
60 days out at The Links at Spanish Bay, 30 days out at Spyglass Hill and one 
day in advance at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Average high temperature in the Monterey area during the month of March is 62 
degrees and the average low temperature is 45 degrees.

Attached is some information on the hotel and golf courses as well as driving 
times and directions from nearby airports.

The resort will only hold these dates until the end of the week so please let 
me know if you would be interested in confirming.  If you choose to look at 
alternate dates, I would be happy to check availability for you.
THANKS!!

It seems that Bradford still feels that we are commercially objecting to some 
credit mitigation.  Can you talk to him,

Thanks Lavo

P.S.

Great job of minimizing the p/l hit late last week.

Just in case my recent lack of emails has left you thinking that you can wait 
until the New Year to get working on your Order of Good Cheer 
fundraising...think again!!

Its now time to take 15 minutes out of your day today to send those letters 
off.  You will be so glad when you come back from ripping up the town/ski 
hill/beach, etc. on New Year's Eve to know that you just have to call up your 
prospective donors and close the deal.  Too easy!!    If you arn't already, 
get motivated -- there are a whole bunch of kids showering in freezing cold 
facilities up at the wilderness school, and studying in cramped quarters who 
will appreciate our help.

I have heard from about half of you and I know that lots of you are ahead of 
the game -- your letters have been sent out and you are working hard on this 
-- keep it up and let me or Brian B. know if you need more brochures, etc.

Have a great holiday and I look forward to hearing about the BIG BUCKS you 
are raising!

Liz

a) Variable Cost of Fuel = $4
   b) Fixed Operating Cost = $16
   c) Transmission = $15.60 (i.e. based on a $100 average pool price)
   d) Freight on Energy above target = $2.40
   e) Availability Incentive Payment = $26
    f) Amortization of Initial $300 MM bid - using 6% = $4
                using 15% = $7.8
    
Total of a) to f) = $68-$72.  Total of what is considered variable cost 
(a+c+d+e)=$48

These costs are based on dispatching the full target availability of 612 MW.  
If the plant is dipatched down to 386 MW, then the 386 MW
have to be priced at 49*612/387 = $76

Hi everybody,

Bill Ketcheson has asked me to let everyone know that if you are interested, 
you can by up to 15 tickets for the Order of Good Cheer. I realize that some 
of you will not be making the dinner tonight so we can make other 
arrangements to get you your tickets. For those of you who are coming, I have 
included Bill's price table should you be interested in more than ten tickets.

Just as a reminder, tonight's dinner is bein held in Rancher's Hall at 
Heritage Park. Drinks will start at 7:00 and a buffet dinner will begin at 
8:00. Be prepared for another one of Maggie's tough quizes for after dinner 
and we'll see you tonight. If you have any questions, my work number is 
262-5971.

Subject: Hedge Fund Update & Summary

Fred asked me to pull together an update for you on our dealings with Hedge 
Funds. Look forward to seeing you at 2PM today.

We have active trading relationships with two hedge Funds, Tudor & Ospraie, 
and have documentation negotiations under way with 11 others. In addition, we 
were trading with Tiger earlier in the year before they closed down. The 
commodity traders I dealt with at Tiger (Paul Touradji & Rob Ellis) are in 
the process of setting up their own hedge fund and will trade with us again 
in late Autumn once they get their paper work in order.

2000 Hedge Fund Origination Summary

Tiger   $112,000  (began trading in Dec 99 and stopped in Mar 00)
Tudor   $384,700 (began trading in Mar 00)
Ospraie  $589,940 (began trading in May 00)

Total year to date $1,086,640 (My budget est for 2000 is approx $2mm)

I've attached two files. The first is a spread sheet with all our hedge fund 
trades year to date in detail. In there you will see a tab for work in 
progress, these are the funds I am targeting to get signed on for trading 
with us and the state of play with each.  The second is a word document 
listing the hedge funds I have had contact with.  While the Hedge Fund 
universe is large, 1500-2000 easily, the ones that trade commodities and more 
specifically trade OTC rather than futures are limited. The entire universe 
is probably no more than 30-50 names, many of which are too small to bother 
with. For the most part I look for them to have $100mm under management since 
the allocation to energy commodities is usually a small percent of that, e.g. 
10-15%. A few of them, however, specialize in commodities and represent my 
priority target clients.

It sounds like the urgency on the Wind Power decision wasn't a reality.  
Kevin says that they are working on it.  If you need me to do anything let me 
know.

Sorry I didn't get back quickly.

You need to tell me what the premium translates into from a dayrate 
perspective.  In addition, I thought you were going to write an outline of 
what they would try to do in the next little while. (ie how much one way 
exposure)  This way I don't have to get involved in every deal until they 
prove to me that is big enough to allocate a risk manager to the market.

Through the course of the year 22 people have been identified by east power 
as the key to their real time group.  No request will be granted on an 
emergency basis but will go through the usual process of getting facts and 
checking with me.  Another thing is that I don't know why we are not doing 
these things in conjunction with PRC so late in the year.

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $1.05/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.

John,

Thanks for the time today.  I enjoyed talking to you about your plans for 
East Power and the 24 Hour Group.   I have been nothing but impressed with 
the caliber of people here at Enron during my short tenure, and you are no 
exception.  Leadership starts at the top, and I am encouraged that you 
represent this through your clear direction for the group and willingness to 
listen to the ideas and suggestions of your employees. 

Thanks again,

Larry

Subject: Enron Europe Support

We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
appropriate for our activities.

The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
states of development and application of business strategies.

The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
experience and corresponding strategy.

I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
business.  

MFG

FYI:  The PML valuation process resulted in incremental "value" which can be 
taken into income.  I told Juanita and Andrea that it would be ridiculously 
imprudent to take any more income.  Andrea and her analytics staff tend to 
agree with me but Delainey is on to it and will likely push to take it.  I 
told Ondarza and Delainey that I will not sign off on it.  Without my 
signature, Delainey may end up calling you.  ENA has a Q4 hole that Cliff is 
trying to fill.  The income that ENA may try to squeeze from PML is 
US$2-4MM.  

On a related matter, Paul wants to take over the Board responsibilities (and 
overall management) of the deal.  Paul is comfortable with the value 
recognized to date, and agrees with us that we should not take any more.  
Given the related income form energy management (C$500M) and financial 
advisory fee (approx C$1,500M), I think it is a good thing for Enron Canada 
to manage.

John,

Hunter Shively needs Doyle Baughman to monitor the construction of a pipeline 
in the U.S.  Doyle has done this for us in the past.

The terms of the agreement are as follows:

1st month $10,000 + expenses
2nd+ months $  9,000 + expenses

Hunter anticipates that we will use Doyle for several months.  We can 
terminate our agreement at anytime.

Regards,
Brad

First of all I'm going to kill you.  Belfor asked me to advise him on his 
portfolio.  I'll do it once.  I have a call with him on Tuesday at 2:00.  Can 
you meet me Tuesday morning with all the deals they have with us.

John

P.S.  I'll never call one of your customers again.

John: 

On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be 
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate 
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was 
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the 
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing 
deals. 

This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We 
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship 
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th, 
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM 
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet, 
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your 
attendance.

See you there.

John,
The Policy was re-written in haste in the fall of 1998 (by some chump named 
seyfried) to attempt to incorporate a new paradigm in the way we managed our 
Merchant Portfolio.  The new paradigm never materialized for a number of 
reasons, leaving the Policy somewhat ambiguous.  We had been hesitant to 
change it given that we were never quite sure whether or not this thought 
process would be resurrected.  It appears that now would be a good time to 
consider changes to reflect current business practices and add clarity.  I 
will take a shot at it myself for the August Board meeting, however, I would 
prefer to do so with your and Lavo's input.  Please advise at your earliest 
convenience.
 On some specifics:
Officially, the EIP portfolio has never been used.  It was a holdover from 
the SPP (supply positioning pool) associated with the Sithe transaction.  
There have been those that have referenced EIP/SPP in the past, however, I 
believe that this was done so in error and not in compliance with Policy.
The Capital portfolio was originally intended to provide capital market 
hedges for the Merchant Portfolio and trade the stock of Enron Corp and other 
Enron Corp public entitiies (EOG) on an opportunistic basis.  The capital 
market transfer process has yet to take place (nor does it look like it is 
ever going to), therefore this portfolio has been used solely for the 
CFO/Treasurer to take mark-to-market postions in Enron.  
I will adjust the authorized trader list to reflect the oversight 
responsibility and the change of LNG to John.  
Thanks for your input.
Ted

A couple of points and questions:

1)   Is the EIP position going to get traced on the DPR - because this has 
gotten fouled up in the past
2)   Can we be more explicit on what constitutes the Capital Portfolio - I 
think there has been
       confusion on what is here as well.
3)  Also why not show if Lavo or I have the overview role.  For example now 
that LNG has moved under Shankman
      Lavo should take the oversight role rather than me.

Gentlemen (and I use the term loosely!):
Now that you have been duly authorized by the COO and CRO of Enron to have 
global risk responsibility, you need to authorize the individual responsible 
for each individual commodity group delineated in the Risk Management 
Policy.  I took the liberty of making a stab at it for you.  Please review 
attachment and let me know if you have  any changes.  If ok, I will forward 
to you for your signature and on to Rick Buy to make official.  These 
individuals will then be responsible for designating those that can transact 
on their behalf.  
Any questions, please call me asap.

Earlier this year, Dana had several mis-booking issues with the UI 
transaction, which resulted in negative trading hits in Q3 (already 
incorporated in P&L).   The significant items were:

 RESCO PPA (outages not booked properly) - $8 million
 Congestion & Ancillary Assumptions  - $8-10 million
 Millstone nuclear option ($32/Mwh option) - $5-6 million  (With sale of 
Millstone, this option goes away)

The $32/Mwh Seabrook nuclear plant daily option was not modeled for 01-03 
because the sale of Seabrook (expected to occur earlier this year) is an 
automatic termination of the $32/Mwh option, therefore the value was not 
booked.  Since the sale of Seabrook sale has not occured yet and a minimum of 
10 months is required to get state & local, NRC and FERC approvals for the 
sale of Seabrook, we have a positive value surprise to the tune of $10-12 
million (assuming option is booked through 9/01.

Let me know if you want us to take the value for 4th quarter or wait until 
next year to take the income.    Since we have a pact to not hide anything, I 
wanted to make you aware of this situation.

John,

I have attached some updated appendices from last May's Ontario Electricity 
Supply & Demand report created by Eric LeDain.  Unfortunately, the IMO has 
not updated the Monthly Generation by Type, Monthly Imports & Exports by 
Intertie and the Nuclear Performance Reports.

In early November, we had requested all IMO Transition Information be 
updated.  To date, the IMO has only updated hourly demand information.  As we 
continue to pressure the IMO, more information will be available.

Updates were made on the following appendices:

1. Ontario Net Exports/Imports - January 1997 through August of 2000

2. Scatter Diagram of Load and Cooling Degree Days

3. Ontario Average Peak Demand at each Temperature 1998, 1999, and 2000 
(through the month of October)

4. Peak Supply and Demand 2001,2002, & 2003



I would like to submit a complete report when the IMO Transition Information 
is updated.

Toronto is great.  We have a quality team here. I'm am anxious for the market 
to open.

Garrett

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile

Sign-ups are still going well.  The following is the status as of Friday, 
Feb.4

MEU's signed up to firm contracts: 34
# of customers: 730,000
Load: 2700 MW
Gross Revenue: CAD$2.8 MM/yr = CAD$8.5 MM over 3 years.  Revenues begin as of 
market opening.

Also, 970 MW of load has nominated for our Power Pool concept.  This 
represents CAD$1.7 MM/year = CAD$5.1 MM over 3 years in Power Pool 
administration fees.  Any term power sales to this pool is incremental - we 
do not have an exclusive supply basis to this pool.  This is not absolutely 
firm at this point as we need to develop how the Power Pool will work prior 
to committing from our end.  As well, this is subject to the MEU's choosing 
to carry out their SSS obligations through a third party. (ENERconnect's 
lawyers view this nomination as allready firm - I would rather wait until we 
have spent some time with the MEU's who have signed up for this to ensure 
they know what they have done....)

MEUs with string interest and paper in (either not signed right or with 
conditions, etc.): 23
# of customers: 245,000
Load: 600
Gross Revenue: CAD$1.5 MM/year = CAD$4.5 MM over 3 years. 

Cheers, Paul D

John, attached is a brief memo for you to pass on to J. Sutton.  It address 
both Ontario and Alberta.  My understanding is that the two people that Mr. 
Sutton is meeting next Wednesday at the Canadian Embassy  are Jim Wilson 
(Ontario Minister of Energy) and Tony Clement (Ontario Minister of the 
Environment , also Minister of Municipal Affairs).  Accordingly, I suspect 
that the  part on Ontario will be most relevant for Mr. Sutton's purposes.  
It occurs to me that Mr. Sutton might want: a) a brief profile of each of 
Wilson and Clement  (i.e there is some personal data that he may find of 
interest for conversation purposes - i.e. Wilson is very proud of the fact 
that his great- uncle, Father Jim Wilson, founded Little League baseball in 
Houston); and b) a memo setting out some key messages which Mr. Sutton might 
deliver regarding the Ontario market.  Let me know and I can get that stuff 
to you on Monday to forward on.

Please do not email this to John.  I believe that I have been receiving a

the event that this is an update or different information, always direct it

I think Overdyke is still working on the peaker insurance deal.  He has Per

Thanks

P.S.  

At the end of the term of each simulation do we assume that we close the 
position on that date and take a hit or do we leave the simulation with an 
open positon.

Subject: Re: New Associates  

In the fundamentals group under Hunter, there is also research going on 
regarding LNG, and distillates, (and gas, weather, etc).  Vikas' background 
is in crude and products, and worked at Aquiva with two of Lagrasta's 
marketers.  I agreed to take him (6 months ago) and was planning for him to 
research crude/products.  Celeste Roberts knows the conversations we had with 
Vikas in particular becuase he wanted to start meeting people in my group and 
originally did not come through the associate program, where we finally put 
him, and she was involved from the beginning.  Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that 
Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was 
slated to go elsewhere.    I picked her up, after that, and she too is 
someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last 
summer, and at Wharton recruiting events.  Prior to John's coming down 
Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do 
research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler.  I have no 
idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either 
of them.  

I suspect now that we have delineated recruiting and staffing, which occurred 
recently, we won't have this confusion among the associate program 
administrators again.  

Not trying to kill you,

Jeff

risk business in gas and east power in the short run.  This was well planned 
effort.

Dave and John, I spoke to Jeff Shenkman and he has indicated that the 
following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets:

Dustin Collins
Vikas Dwivedi
Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are 
identified in our system.

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact 
with Jeff regarding these associates supporting him.

Dave, can we discuss this matter?  I can be reached at 713/853-7351.  My 
pager # is 1-800-980-1665.  Thanks.

John,
Doug asked me to send you the amended model for the proposed collar structure.
You will see that is is essentially a larger version of the previous model, as
it covers the full calender year of 2000.  There are therefore 48 options 
which
results in daily volume being reduced to 42K GJ/Day.  There is an amortization
schedule to the far right which calculates the implied interest rate on the
deal.  Call me if you have any questions about the model or changes you would
like to see.

I've taken a look at your resume and pulled your internal reviews.  We have 
decided to go another route.  Sorry.  I'll be in Houston for the next three

I agree with all your points.  There had to be a first time.  
I've been blowing Ted off because of the markets last week.
Let's get together this week with Ted and discuss the future.

Kim please set up meeting with Ox and Bland and me.

Hello Guys-

As of a year and a half ago, Enron cancelled their membership to the AGA.  
This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online 
database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage 
facility.  One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need 
to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $100,000 per year in order to keep 
the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.  
(Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders 
those are VERY critical seconds).

Regards,

Julie  :-)

John,

Just wanted to make sure everything went o.k.  I neglected to remind you 
again when we talked today about obtaining the Certificate of Occupancy, so I 
hope that the Seller delivered it as she had promised.  If not let me know so 
that we can find an immediate solution.  The only other things I would 
caution you on at this point would be as follows:

1)  Make sure to put together your list of warranty repairs prior to 30 days 
from today's date and to deliver same to the Seller within such time period 
(per the warranty agreement).

2)  Make sure to follow up with the Seller about the fireplace.  She is 
supposed to finish that work within 60 days from today's date.

3)  Make sure to compare your title policy, when it comes in the mail, to the 
marked Title Commitment you received today.  There shouldn't be anything in 
the policy that is not in the Title Commitment.  When you get the policy, you 
can send a copy to me and I will be glad to confirm this for you.

4)  You should get the recorded deed in the mail from the title company or 
the county clerk.  If you do not receive it within 30 days, call the title 
company and ask that they find it or obtain a certified copy for you.

If there is anything you need, just let me know.

If you call changing the world not much to do, so be it.  I know Texas is a
big state, but is there enough room to accommodate your arrogance and
Waldren's?

By the way, I want to bring Dena (I think it's with an 'e') something for
putting up with Rich and James.  What kind of perfume does she like?  - Or,
what else might she appreciate?

Give me an idea of required clothing for the evenings.  I assume shorts for
golfing.

I'm sensing that you don't have much to do during the day.  I'm thinking
about inviting Mark Waldren down at the same time.  Please advise.

1.  I didn't know much about ag products but Ted Murphy is trying to include 
me in the loop.

2. Chris Calger says that he has aggregated his CPI positions for the west.  
Can check if Dave Duran has done this for the east and try to aggregate the 
position.  If you need help let me know.

John -- Sorry we did not catch up when I was in Houston in December.? At the 
time, I was in the process of leaving the company I helped to start? and have 
joined a sports marketing agency to build their international business.

At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some projects 
(domestic and international) that we're working on.? One of our business 
groups specialize in the stadium/properties naming rights field and there are 
some great opportunities including the new Pittsburgh Steelers stadium.? I 
thought one of your companies or possibly New Power might have an interest in 
taking a look at it.? Let me know when you have a free moment.

Cheers, BA

 I have been receiving a few calls about where to pick up a costume?
The address is as follows:

 Costume Shoppe 570-2466  1317 - 9 Ave. SE
 It seems that most people are leaving the task of picking out their
costume until the last minute.  Margo has introduced lots of new costumes
for this year.  Hint, Hint - the later you leave it, the bigger the line up
at the Costume Shoppe.

 We would really like to encourage all of our Deputies to wear a
costume.

 If you have any questions, please give me a call at 260-3412.

 thanks,  Sheila

Subject: Friday Meeting on Dayrates

Just as a reminder to everyone, there is a meeting in John Lavorato's office 
this Friday June 2nd regarding Dayrates

John

Enclosed is the presentation that Keith MacIvor and I gave to Noble 
Drilling's CEO, Jim Day and Pride International's CEO, Paul Bragg, their CFO, 
Earl McNiel, and their COO, James Allen this morning 5/30.  Both sets of 
leaders were extremely interested in pursuing dayrate transactions with us.  
Both sets said that they believed this product would have a very positive 
impact of the drilling business.

Jim Day assigned us to his leading financial innovators, Mark May and Steve 
Manz.  Paul Bragg and Earl McNiel are wanting to sign an ISDA asap and begin 
discussions asap.

 I will be giving the same presentation to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, Jim 
Tisch this Thursday (in New York) and a "deal specific" presentation to the 
CFO of Chiles Offshore the same day.

Can you type up thank you letters for me.


Dear xxxx

I would like to thank you for your generous donation to The Order of Good 
Cheer fundraising effort.  Our organization raised over $200,000 for the 
Enviros Program.  The money was much needed and will allow this wonderful 
program to continue to improve the lives of young Calgarians who have 
experienced hardship.

Yours Truly





John Lavorato.

Mr. Lavorato,

Hello.  Below are estimates on the vacation we discussed last week.  I
know that Jamaica was not a set destination but I really feel something
like the FDR Resort might be a good options for a family vacation.  One
of the biggest pluses is the nanny you are assigned upon arrival I think
most people find it really makes the vacation stress fee.  I will be
honest with you there are other resorts in the Caribbean that are nicer
but they are not family resorts.  Programs and things are offered for
children usually starting at 4 years (sometimes 3) of age nanny services
are not really provide and just babysitting that must be prearranged.  If
features like the nanny service are not as important to you then I will
make other suggestions.   I am not including rates on the Boscobel Beach
Resort because they just closed to do renovation that will last until
December 2001.  If you have any questions, need additional information,
or would like to set up reservations please do not hesitate to call or
E-mail.


Regards,
Crystal Schwartz

On a quarterly basis, the Executive Compensation group provides a report to 
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which details Executive 
Committee member stock holidings.    Such holdings include:

shares held in a family trust, 
your personal brokerage account, 
in certificate form, or 
in an IRA.  
any shares held in connection with Company plans (i.e., ESOP, savings plans, 
phantom shares, option grants, or restricted stock grants), although shares 
acquired that are held free-and-clear should be included.

Because of your inclusion in the Executive Committee, we will be requesting 
this data from you prior to each quarter's report.  Your response is greatly 
appreciated.

However, with the recent announcement and the revised Committees, I am in the 
process of updating this report in preparation for the December 11 meeting.  

I have access to shares held in the Company Plans (last bullet above).   
Please provide me with your current personal ENE stock holdings (as of 
11/30/00). 

Please contact me if you have any questions (713-345-8085).

I appreciate your response.

Mary

I thought I was very clear that we are not publishing anything internally 
about California gas prices.

John,

New deal was done on the gas side.  Deal was with Vinatage petroleum in 
Bolivia.  Michael Popkin can fill you in with the details.

The attached report is something that is being put together by Scott Mills 
group.  It is what I look at to get a snapshot.  Is this what you are looking 
for?  Please let me know/provide guidance as to what you want to see.  Do you 
want to be copied on this or some variant? 

Thanks,

Kish

A couple of questions.

1.  Where did the Gas Trading P/L derive from this month.

2.  How are you coming on the position reports we discussed.

Talk to you soon.

I guess we were wrong.

We were totally surprised by the a.g.a. number.  We need to work on are 
ability to predict it.  

Therefore, we probably net sold contracts today and will be under our 40 
Million limit.   I don't think there is any reason to change what we did 
today.  We will keep it in our pocket for 10 days unless you disagree.

John, I think they have to do something to improve the customize pages.  At a 
minimum, they need to build something so you don't have to re add day gas 
everyday.

Subject: Hello

John:

I am not sure whether you remember or not but I met you couple of times in 
Calgary at the trading floor and at parties (Enron's Cajun Party), while I 
was working for Enmax in 1996. I worked with Chris Calger on a number of 
trades and getting the ISDA signed. 

I started with Enron in the Commercial Structuring group earlier this month. 
I am sure the decision to purchase the entitlements (PPA) in Alberta will 
strengthen our position. I used to work in TransAlta as well, so I know the 
units pretty well. Please let me know, if I can be of any help.

I would like to stop by your office for a brief conversation or perhaps go 
for lunch, if your schedule permit.

Regards,

Sanjeev

As part of the info you should put together I thought it would be good to 
have the historic head count (for 1-2 years) by month and by level to try to 
get a sense of how many people we hire.  Might even need the number of hires 
and fires/resignations.  My thought is to try to figure out how difficult it 
would be to have a few committees to interview candidates before offers would 
be made.

01/22 12:52 UPDATE 1-Enron distances itself from Calif. power crisis 

HOUSTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Energy powerhouse Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday 
distanced itself from California's power crisis, saying the turmoil which has 
brought the state's two largest utilities to the brink of bankruptcy would 
not impact its bottom line. 

"We do not expect the California situation to have any significant effect on 
Enron's financial outlook, specifically our ability to hit 2001 targets," 
Jeff Skilling, the president and chief operating officer of North America's 
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas, said in a conference 
call with analysts. 
Skilling also said there hadn't been any significant impact on fourth quarter 
earnings, noting that Enron did not own electricity generation assets in 
California, where rolling electricity blackouts were imposed last week and 
the state's top two utilities are running out of money as they face soaring 
wholesale electricity costs. 

Having sold electricity to the state's main utilities, generating companies 
such as Reliant Energy Inc. <REI.N> and Dynegy Corp. <DYN.N> are now at risk 
of not receiving payments from Pacific Gas and Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp. 
<PCG.N>, and Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International 
<EIX.N>. 

At the same time, some have claimed that power generators have taken 
advantage of the crisis by over-charging the state's utilities, which, as 
part of deregulation, cannot pass on skyrocketing electricity prices to 
consumers. 

"California is a much smaller percentage of our overall earnings than some of 
the other energy companies, particularly generators," Skilling said, adding 
that the company only participates in the merchant business of buying and 
selling electricity. 

"The bottom line is this: We are not overexposed in California or anywhere 
else for that matter." 
Shares of Enron rose $2-3/8 to $73-7/16 on the New York Stock Exchange after 
it reported earnings before nonrecurring items rose 34 percent, to $347 
million in the fourth quarter.

In the fundamentals group under Hunter, there is also research going on 
regarding LNG, and distillates, (and gas, weather, etc).  Vikas' background 
is in crude and products, and worked at Aquiva with two of Lagrasta's 
marketers.  I agreed to take him (6 months ago) and was planning for him to 
research crude/products.  Celeste Roberts knows the conversations we had with 
Vikas in particular becuase he wanted to start meeting people in my group and 
originally did not come through the associate program, where we finally put 
him, and she was involved from the beginning.  Li Sun is a Wharton MBA that 
Lavo did not originally pick when he went through the list with you, and was 
slated to go elsewhere.    I picked her up, after that, and she too is 
someone about whom Celeste and I had many conversations. I had met her last 
summer, and at Wharton recruiting events.  Prior to John's coming down 
Celeste and I had agreed she could come into my organization (gas) to do 
research, or to work with Vince--she is an unbelievable modeler.  I have no 
idea who the other two are or where they are going, and have not met either 
of them.  

I suspect now that we have delineated recruiting and staffing, which occurred 
recently, we won't have this confusion among the associate program 
administrators again.  

Not trying to kill you,

Jeff

Dave and John, I spoke to Jeff Shenkman and he has indicated that the 
following new associates are to support him in his role in Global Markets:

Dustin Collins
Vikas Dwivedi
Li Sun

Although Jeff mentioned a fourth associate, these are the only 3 that are 
identified in our system.

John after speaking with you, it is clear that you have not been in contact 
with Jeff regarding these associates supporting him.

Dave, can we discuss this matter?  I can be reached at 713/853-7351.  My 
pager # is 1-800-980-1665.  Thanks.

Mark

We can make this even simpler.  All broker trades are confirmed the next 
day.  We would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which 
is rare and all marketer deals.  If we do this we might consider keeping the 
tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape.  

Please advise.

I thought the EIP was the stock option hedging.  Who is doing that and how 
are we tracking
it so it doesn't get screwed up like it did earlier in the year.

Subject: Re: Authorized Traders  

John,
The Policy was re-written in haste in the fall of 1998 (by some chump named 
seyfried) to attempt to incorporate a new paradigm in the way we managed our 
Merchant Portfolio.  The new paradigm never materialized for a number of 
reasons, leaving the Policy somewhat ambiguous.  We had been hesitant to 
change it given that we were never quite sure whether or not this thought 
process would be resurrected.  It appears that now would be a good time to 
consider changes to reflect current business practices and add clarity.  I 
will take a shot at it myself for the August Board meeting, however, I would 
prefer to do so with your and Lavo's input.  Please advise at your earliest 
convenience.
 On some specifics:
Officially, the EIP portfolio has never been used.  It was a holdover from 
the SPP (supply positioning pool) associated with the Sithe transaction.  
There have been those that have referenced EIP/SPP in the past, however, I 
believe that this was done so in error and not in compliance with Policy.
The Capital portfolio was originally intended to provide capital market 
hedges for the Merchant Portfolio and trade the stock of Enron Corp and other 
Enron Corp public entitiies (EOG) on an opportunistic basis.  The capital 
market transfer process has yet to take place (nor does it look like it is 
ever going to), therefore this portfolio has been used solely for the 
CFO/Treasurer to take mark-to-market postions in Enron.  
I will adjust the authorized trader list to reflect the oversight 
responsibility and the change of LNG to John.  
Thanks for your input.
Ted

A couple of points and questions:

1)   Is the EIP position going to get traced on the DPR - because this has 
gotten fouled up in the past
2)   Can we be more explicit on what constitutes the Capital Portfolio - I 
think there has been
       confusion on what is here as well.
3)  Also why not show if Lavo or I have the overview role.  For example now 
that LNG has moved under Shankman
      Lavo should take the oversight role rather than me.

Gentlemen (and I use the term loosely!):
Now that you have been duly authorized by the COO and CRO of Enron to have 
global risk responsibility, you need to authorize the individual responsible 
for each individual commodity group delineated in the Risk Management 
Policy.  I took the liberty of making a stab at it for you.  Please review

to you for your signature and on to Rick Buy to make official.  These

on their behalf.  
Any questions, please call me asap.

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas 
desk VaR dropped to $3.8


Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think 
it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider 
sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, 
maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to 
both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them 
to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

Subject: EnronCredit Move

John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.


1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.


I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Darren Adamik

As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention=
=20
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a=

o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups. =20
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale. =20

There will be a Trader's Roundtable meeting every Tuesday at 4:00PM in 
EB3321.  

First Message that was sent out:
As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Without Detroit Edison, the Moore Power Project involves development of the 
project to supply merchant peak power to the Ontario market starting November 
1, 2000.  Permitting and interconnect agreements would be completed to 
interconnect to MECS as well as Ontario Hydro SERVCO, however, the execution 
of the Detroit Edison interconnection agreement would be deferred 
(optionality maintained).  Interconnection would be made to Ontario Hydro for 
November 1, 2000.

There are three project scenarios going forward:
1. Develop the project and maintain 100% Enron interest
2. Develop the project and sell part or all of equity
3. Sell turbines, and possibly developed site (separate from turbines)


Here is the action being taken at this time:
1. Stop work order and request of all consultants to provide the following:
 -  Confirmation of costs to date on permitting and preliminary engineering 
(just an update of our weekly cost tracking system)
 - Provide costs to completion (permit approval), and schedule
 - EPC schedule for a November 1, 2000 start date, and critical path
 - Costs for the further technical support we require with interconnects etc.
The above will be linked in with the payment/decommissioning schedule for the 
turbines, and interconnect studies/agreement costs (including gas agreements) 
to come up with a total activities, cost and schedule projection to 
completion of permitting (at approval) and interconnection agreements, 
linking that to the schedule for a November 1, 2000 start-up.
2. Compilation of all data on the Ontario market, to provide a picture of 
generation type availabilites, hourly demand trends for each month of the 
year, peak demands for 1998 and 1999 and growth pattern. historical 
generation on the margin, imports/exports, reserve margins, purchased reserve 
support, monthly supply guaranteed at $.038/kWhr and implications on OPGI 
drive to push spot market up during certain months, etc.
3. Confirmation of ICF Kaiser timing and costs for an Ontario market analysis 
and price curve projection preparation as support to a pitch document to 
potential equity participants.
4. Structuring in Houston have been asked to make an assessment of an Ontario 
"bid curve" based on NY West, and MECS/ECAR curves, winter peak dynamics, new 
market opening volatility (using other market examples), Ontario import 
capabilites etc.  We will also provide the appropriate supply/demand 
information to them.  They will have to support curves into RAROC.


Summarizing the timing:
1. Define costs and schedule to "develop" project to point of sale; (Jan 26)

2. Confirm potential of Ontario market, and link to structuring's "curve" 
projection (Jan 28)
During this time, seek commitment to re-initiate permit and technical support 
work to complete the permitting phase. 

3. Have ICF Kaiser prepare market price assessment (kick off Jan 28)

4. Prepare information memorandum in support of the project as potential core 
to a pitch book to potential equity participants
(dash type data but with just general financials assumptions plus details on 
market) (Feb 9 first draft)
During this time re-assess interest in developing the asset on our own, or in 
seeking equity participants, or in selling the turbines on their own prior to 
completing the information memorandum.

Subject: Power Hedges in Accrual Book

Stacy White informed me this morning there is discussions on moving all of 
the Power Hedges from the accrual book (approx $100 million loss) into the 
MTM books.  Is this true?

Do I need to be in the loop?

FYI - We successfully bought out of the 2001 supply commitment to OPPD at our 
mark ($4.7 million).  This leaves us with 3 customer deals that I would like 
to set aside as prudency C for East Power (not West Power or gas) for 
calender year 2001.   The 3 deals are MJMUC, VEPCO, and JEA.

Thanks.

John, as requested, please see the attached. It's password protected, so you 
will need to call me. 

On a related note, I wanted your guidance on how you have in the past had 
input into non-commercial bonus numbers. Did you call guys like Shapiro, 
Colwell, Beck, Haedicke, etc. to agree to numbers or will they check with me 
before approving any numbers?

I totally support having a separate marketing and trading team in Ontario to 
focus on the opening of that market.  However, with respect to creating a 
redundant physical system operation/real-time unit monitoring/dispatch 
function in Ontario, it simply does not make economic or logistical sense.  
With the integration of the  6 peaker plants into our operation and the 
associated IT support, control area operations, plant operations, hourly 
trading, and real-time monitoring system here in Houston, we could provide 
all the necessary tools and support personnel necessary to perform this 
function from Houston.   All the critical trading information would obviously 
be available to the Ontario office, yet they would not have to be burdened by 
the additional overhead to build a stand alone physical operation.

>From my standpoint, it just doesn't make sense to re-create the physical 
capabilities the Houston office has developed over the past two years.  The 
Ontario guys are doing a great job and I like their aggressive attitude, 
however, rationale business decisions should still prevail.

Your thoughts?

Attached is the data you requested today.   The schematic detail requested 
can be found in the email attachment at the bottom of this email.  Please 
also contact Ed Baughman on the TIE proposal for dispatching, scheduling and 
trading services that was recently done to leverage of the existing Genco 
facilities and staff.

On the dedicated ring downs all work was co-ordinated by Darren Adamik 
(713-853-4764) if you require additional details.

Generally it will take 4 staff for a 24 hour operation plus one vacation/sick 
relief.  Depending on the complexity of the operation you will have to 
determine the level of industry expertise.  A good plan would be to hire a 
senior lead utility type and then bring on junior staff.  The quality and 
quantity of staff will likely be based on the value at risk and the 
complexity of dispatching these units. 

If you consider the operation critical a diesel and UPS will be required.

Plasma displays run $10,000 to $15,000 per display plus any switching/av 
equipment.

We have a PI consultant on contract that could be available for your PI 
project - typically $ 150.00 per hour plus travel and expenses.

The above assumes that no special hardware/software is required from The IMO 
to dispatch these units.

John, the attached is a summary by Greg of the financining for the turbines 
purchased from New Brunswick Power.

In summary, ECC pays the bank, West LB directly in three installments under 
an off-balance sheet lease financing arrangement.  The first installment of 
$US 9MM was made Dec. 1/99.  The next installment is due Feb. 1/00 of $US 
8MM, and the third installment is due roughly March 31/00 of $US 8MM. The 
"drag" on the financing is that West LB through whom ENA structures its 
off-balance sheet turbine financings is not a Canadian resident for tax 
purposes, and therefore is not tax efficient to ECC in that there is a 15% 
withholding tax payment on the interest (not principal) component of each 
lease/financing payment.  An off-balance sheet financing with a Canadian 
resident financial institution would eliminate this tax inefficiency, and 
this is what I was referring to when I indicated some work may still be 
required to restructure the turbine financing.  The withholding tax if we 
keep this structure will total roughly C$ 500,000 over all of the 
lease/financing payments (Chris Calger has the exact figure).  Any decision 
to change the structure should have regard to these costs and the transaction 
costs and fees associated with finding a new Canadian resident off-balance 
sheet lender.  In addition, if we decide to keep the turbines, or sell or 
transfer the turbines to ENA or a third party (depending on commercially what 
it is we decide to do with them), additional work may be required to take 
title to the turbines, or to assign/restructure the West LB financing and the 
New Brunswick Power purchase agreement.  I am confident that the bulk of 
commercial legal work for any of these transactions can be handled 
internally, but that the tax legal work may require the input of outside 
counsel.

We are also obligated to pay GST, but this is ultimately reimbursed through 
the lease financing (althoguh there is a time value of money component that 
is not recovered from the time GST is paid and when the GST rebate is made).

Subject: WestLB Transaction

Peter, referring to your request for an update as to the status and mechanics 
of the West LB transaction relating to our acquisition of the NB Power 
turbines, please be advised as follows:

1.  Although ENA executed the Acquisition and Development Agreement (the 
"Agreement") with WestLB, all of ENA's interest in that Agreement was 
immediately assigned to Enron Canada, meaning that we are directly 
responsible for making all funding requests and all cost of borrowing 
payments to WestLB.

2.  The initial payment on the turbines was made through WestLB for an amount 
of US$9,000,000 on December 1, 1999.  GST was payable on US$5,000,000 of that 
amount.

3.  The next installment is due to NB Power on February 1, 2000 and is for an 
amount of US$8,000,000.  Laura Scott will be initiating the funding request 
in the next day or so to allow the advance to be a LIBOR advance.  WestLB 
will then attend to paying the installment payment (plus GST) to NB Power on 
Feb 1.

4.  The final installment payment is for an amount of US$8,000,000 and is due 
on the earlier of the date on which we commence disassembling the turbines 
and March 31, 2000.

5.  The cost to Enron Canada for utilizing WestLB, who is not registered in 
Canada to carry on business, is that we are required to pay withholding tax 
of 15% on all costs of borrowing (ie. interest payments).  The interest is 
calculated at a LIBOR rate.

6.  WestLB has now registered themselves in Canada for GST purposes and will 
be making the required GST payments to NB Power and then applying for the GST 
rebate, which rebate amount is for our account under the Agreement.

7.  WestLB is aware that, depending on how we proceed with our required use 
of the turbines, they will be taken out either with respect to (i) the 
interim financing or, if the interim financing period is short (ie. if we 
were going to proceed immediately to finish paying for the turbines and 
commence moving them), (ii) when we put the SPV in place to build the 
project.  

8.  If we determine that the turbines are to go to Houston and be moved into 
the US, the withholding tax issue obviously disappears.  If we determine to 
proceed with the project in some fashion but the interim financing period 
will be more than a month or so, it probably makes sense to remove WestLB 
from the interim financing, thereby saving ourselves the cost of the 
withholding tax.  One potential fix is to bring in a Canadian bank to act as 
funding agent, with WestLB continuing to bear the transactional risk, which 
could reduce the cost to us of getting a new bank comfortable with the 
financing arrangement.  We have not yet canvassed all the possible solutions, 
so I have not thought through to the full extent whether this proposal is 
viable.

I think that you are aware of the reasons that the determination was made to 
proceed with WestLB despite the withholding tax issue, but if you would like 
to discuss this any further or if there is anything else you would like to 
discuss, I am happy to do so.  

Greg

Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power announce leasing agreement at Bruce 
Nuclear 

    KINCARDINE, ON, July 11 /CNW-PRN/ - Ontario Power Generation (OPG) today
announced it has entered into a major agreement with Bruce Power Partnership
relating to the facilities at the Bruce nuclear site. Bruce Power is 95% owned
by British Energy plc. The transaction provides an opportunity for the two
main unions, the Power Workers' Union and The Society of Energy Professionals
on the Bruce site, to subscribe to 5% of the equity.
    This public/private partnership involves a long-term lease agreement for
the Bruce A (3076 MW-currently in lay-up), and Bruce B (3140 MW) facilities.
The lease runs until 2018, with an option to extend for up to another 25
years. OPG will receive an initial payment of $625 M to be made in three
installments. A first payment of $400 M will be made on closing subject to
normal closing adjustments. The remaining $225 M will be paid in two
installments of $112.5 M each.
    Bruce Power's annual payments include base and variable elements. The
variable elements include a share of the net revenue, and supplementary
payments for the management of used fuel. In total these payments are
estimated to be about $150 M in calendar year 2002.
    Bruce Power will offer employment to all employees at the Bruce site,
other than those being retained by OPG. Employees remaining with OPG include
those that provide waste management and centralized nuclear operations support
services. The agreement is expected to close, subject to Bruce Power obtaining
the necessary licences, in the summer of 2001.
    "Today's announcement is good news for employees, the community, the
electricity consumer and the shareholder" stated Ron Osborne, OPG President
and CEO. "This agreement injects private equity into the Bruce facilities
which in turn will provide new opportunities for employees and the community.
It is also a major step towards opening the Ontario electricity marketplace to
competition and providing electricity consumers with choice." Osborne noted
that an additional benefit of the agreement allows OPG to concentrate on
accelerating the performance improvements underway at its Darlington and
Pickering nuclear facilities while the new company focuses on the Bruce.
    Nuclear safety continues to be of paramount importance for Ontario Power
Generation, and safety has been a key tenet for British Energy. Both companies
are committed to ensuring high safety performance standards.
    "We are delighted to be announcing the creation of a new company. Bruce
Power will demonstrate that safety and commercial success go hand in hand,"
said Robin Jeffrey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of British Energy
Canada Ltd. "We have a high regard for CANDU technology and for the skill of
the staff at Bruce. We are confident that by working with the staff and the
unions, Bruce Power can achieve world class safety and commercial
performance."
    To reduce its market dominance, OPG is required by conditions in its
operating licence granted by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB), to reduce its
share of generating capacity to no more than 35 per cent of that available to
the province 10 years after the market opens.
    British Energy was selected following an extensive worldwide competitive
process over the last two years. They have significant operating experience
and a proven safety track record with a range of nuclear reactor types.
    To close the transaction, Bruce Power will be required to secure licences
from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) and the Ontario Energy
Board. Bruce Power will be required to follow the stringent licensing and
operating requirements established by CNSC, formerly the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
    Ontario Power Generation is a major North American electricity generating
company. OPG's principal business is the generation and sale of electricity to
consumers in Ontario and into the interconnected markets. OPG's goal is to be
a premier North American energy company, focused on low-cost power generation
and wholesale energy sales, while operating in a safe, open and
environmentally responsible manner.
    British Energy PLC is the UK's largest electricity generator. British
Energy owns and operates 15 reactors in the UK and a further two in the United
States through its joint venture, AmerGen. British Energy's goal is to be a
worldwide electricity leader building on its "Safety First" culture and track
record of commercial success.

John, I thought I would send you a note to outline our conversation re. David 
Redmond.  Dave will return to the London office in late May.  In late 
February we will pinpoint the group/job that will best suit Dave and Enron.  
All efforts will be made to get Dave an option trading related position. 

Regards,


John Lavorato

We need to think about trying to get more VAR for the gas floor before all 
these other commodities go to the Board and scare the hell out of them.  I 
have several reasons for this so lets discuss.

The Emmisions book under Kevin McGowan will take a one time $4 Million hit 
today.  This is to move the curves to better reflect the current market.  
This hit will stay in the Coal group but will be removed from its P/L from a 
performance measurement standpoint.  Now that the curves are corrected I 
expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following 
ways:

1.  Understanding the fundamentals.
2.  Taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast.
3.  Building more liquidity and being the primary market maker.
4.  Developing new traders.

Thanks
 
John

Subject: Updated WTI Trading Simulation

John,

The updated model does not give answers too different from the earlier 
version.   The changes made were in correcting the handing of contract rolls 
and correcting some of the roll dates.

The model still gives a higher profit, sometimes, for the cases of 1,000,000 
bbl position limit vs.  5,000,000 bbl limit.   I took a look in detail at the 
5 MM bbl case which gave lower profit (3 yrs out of Nov 95).   The intuition 
is that there are two offsetting things which happen when you raise the 
position limit.

1) you have a larger position to profit from when the market reverses a 
trend, but
2) you loose much more money in a long term trending market, and to the 
extent that you still hit your position limit, you will not make it all back 
when the market reverses.

In the specific above case, you hit the position limits for both 1 MM bbl and 
5 MM bbl, and the superior strategy is a trade off between limiting losses 
vs. having a larger position from which to gain on major market reversals.

--Stinson

John,

Here are the simulations for:

Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
Roll to fill price gap

I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all 
the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.


Normal Roll No Roll  Fill Gap





Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.

The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that 
I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me 
know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of 
Enron.

Regards,
Tim

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

The Zufferli stuff seems like it is getting a little confused in Canada.  
They might need to change his Contract to Canadian language but none of the 
terms should change including the end date except for his agreed upon 
Canadian $ pay.

The number of trades doesn't seem to match between your presentation and the 
spreadsheet data.  The spreadsheet shows 17 power trades this year and your 
presentation shows almost that many every month.  Same comment for the gas

Sorry If you tried to look at the web site:

http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/

The IT development group was working on it so it was out of commission.  It 
is available now.  However, like I indicated it is only a template.

John,
Just thinking out loud, I think the market has a better chance of seeing $5, 
maybe $3 dollars, before it see's $9.  I would recommend initiating a short 
position.

My stop loss, would depend on trade size, however, without doubt,  I would be 
flat if we got over unchanged.

Frank

The following points refer to the methodology that we are taking to rebook 
the New Albany Plant.  Please send me a note immediately if you disagree.
Assume that NewAlb is a non mark to market entity and Enron is the mark to 
market entity.  However, it is fully owned and operated by us for now.


*  The power mark to market book will pay NewAlb a capacity payment of $4.87 
for 5 years.  We shaped this payment as follows:

2001 - $5.06
2002 - $4.96
2003 - $4.86
2004 - $4.75
2005 - $4.65

*  This payments allows Enron to supply gas to NewAlb and receive power. 

*  Enron will pay NewAlb $1000 per unit start.

*  Enron will also pay NewAlb $2.00/MW hour for varialbe o&m.

*  This will create an entity "NewAlb" that will return 9% assuming a book 
value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently.

*  If NewAlb pays the 9% out that entity should be relatively flat each year 
for the next five.

Rick,
This is my initial attempt to summarize our meeting with John.  The next 
steps would be to solicit feedback from other interested parties and scope 
the resources and responsibilities.
Ted

Rick Buy, John Lavorato and I met to discuss priorities as it relates to the 
calculation of VAR.  We are making the following recommendations

 1) Inclusion of monthly index positions into VAR calculations as the 
indicies set in North American Natural Gas
 2) Development of a methodology to re-run correlations (factor loadings) 
including criteria, responsibilities and acceptance/rejection criteria
 3) Development of process by which to analyze the output of factor loading 
process.  Database to store output and management reports.
 4) Finalize debate on the calculation of Forward/Forward volatility
 5) Scope a project to analyze the possibility of calculating hourly 
volatility for power.

It was further recommended that we continue to not include unpriced index 
positions in VAR calculation.

Hi Jane - I'm trying to make this clear but let me know if I've missed 
something or if you have a different understanding of the arrangement:

Janice re-calculated the retro payment to include the 21% gross-up and is 
arranging to deposit to John's account (gross amt is 22,626.90 less taxes = 
$9,955.84).  In the meantime, the new USD amount for your moving package 
letter is $141,479.04 USD       (141,480, rounded).  When we convert to CAD 
(1.4978), it's $211,907.30 (211,908.74, rounded)

Here's the breakdown:
211,907.30 (Total Paid - Gross) CAD
-149,780.00 (100,000 at 1.4978) - original bonus payment
-31,453.80 (21,000 at 1.4978) - original bonus payment, grossed up
-8,046.60 (Add'l payment for new salary retro to Apr)
-22,626.90 (Gross-up adj re retro payment)
0.0

Key Points:
John Lavorato's effective transfer date from Calgary to Houston is June 16, 
2000
a payment of $141,479.04 USD (141,480, rounded) is made to John for 
completion of duties in Canada - this is converted to CAD $211,907.30 
(211,908.74, rounded)

Jane, please send me a copy of the revised letter (relocation) so we can have 
something authorizing us to make this payment.  
Thanks!!

He was owed $74,240 for the retro payment, he was paid $59,943.40, so the 
difference is 14,296.60 less taxes of 6,250.00.  The net deposit is $8,046.60 
Canadian.

I understand John received a retro payment of salary.  In order to document 
the payment as received in Canada, can you give me the exact amount of the 
payment and when it was made?

Thanks.

The model looks great except when I changed an input and hit go it blew up.  
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  One thing that I would like changed is that 
I want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last 
day.  So the role should happen on the second last day not the last day.  
Please change that if you can.

Subject: Authorized Traders

Gentlemen (and I use the term loosely!):
Now that you have been duly authorized by the COO and CRO of Enron to have 
global risk responsibility, you need to authorize the individual responsible 
for each individual commodity group delineated in the Risk Management 
Policy.  I took the liberty of making a stab at it for you.  Please review 
attachment and let me know if you have  any changes.  If ok, I will forward 
to you for your signature and on to Rick Buy to make official.  These 
individuals will then be responsible for designating those that can transact 
on their behalf.  
Any questions, please call me asap. 
Ted x3-3324

I am with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and am trying to find out 
more information on market and financial risk management devices.  Enron 
appears to have one of the largest varieties of measures and is extremely 
well respected in this field.

Can you provide some information about the Market & Financial Risk Management 
products that you provide for the US Natural Gas Industry.  I am looking for 
pricing information  as well as availability.  Information pertaining to the 
Northwest would be greatly appreciated.  For example cost of a natural gas 
future (range of premiums)  Cost of weather insurance based on what measure? 

If you do not have that kind of information but can point me in the right 
direction it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your assistance,

Michael Fuss

Subject: Possibility of Delay in Alberta Restructuring

Rob, I spoke to Larry Charach of the ADRD on Friday and specifically asked if 
the Government was considering a delay of its restructuring timetable to: 1) 
address concerns of consumers that it is impossible for them to make a choice 
of supplier prior to November 1, 2000, and/or 2) to give time to develop a 
workable Plan B.  Larry was adamant that there will be no delay in Alberta 
and said there is no point in any stakeholder even proposing a delay because 
it such a proposal was a "non-starter" and won't happen.  He told me during 
the discussion that investors will not invest in a jurisdiction where the 
government does not follow through with what it says it will do and he 
referred to the Jan 1, 2001 date as a firm commitment of the government 
entrenched in the legislation.  I agreed with him that this was absolutely 
the right approach and told him that the Government had Enron's full support 
on this issue.

Wow I don't think so.   I thought I would rewrite yours and correct some of 
the factual errors.  If you disagree please write me back.

I moved from our Houston office in 1994 to Calgary and in 1999 was named 
President of the Canadian operation.  We went from a small gas marketing shop 
to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in Canada.  It was 
absolutely awesome.  I had the time of my life.  We built the business with 
very little supervision from Houston into a major contributor to Enron Corp's 
bottom line.  These days, as many people know, we are using the same trading 
and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create 
liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others.  
So our newer people still have the chance to do what I did in Canada and help 
build revolutionary new businesses.

What a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk 
management presence is in Natural Gas and Power.  The opportunities our 
outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.  These 
businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different 
variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage 
in Montana to how to move power from New York to South Caralina.  You can't 
put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other 
commodities.  Its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to 
figure out what the Fed is going to do.  It has much more complexity, and if 
you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down 
here! .... we need you!

John's callout quote

Enron's not a place where you can hide.  If you can't get it done you won't 
fit in.  But if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll 
excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you.

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently 
distributed to the appropriate trading and origination groups for review 
prior to going live.  The intent is to capture as much of the corporate 
credit market as possible, as quickly as possible, by leveraging our internal 
resources (people, processes and systems especially EnronOnline) and the new 
mediums for communication.    To this extent, any ideas that you might have 
for getting the eyeballs of potential counterparties please let us know.  

This email marks the first of regular updates on our credit trading 
initiatives.  We will use this as a mechanism to keep all of you in the loop 
as to where we are in the implementation process and solicit your input on 
ways to integrate credit products into your existing business models and 
customer base.

DJ Ontario Power CEO: Up To 7,000 MW 'In Play' By End 1Q

 TORONTO (Dow Jones)--About 7,000 megawatts of Ontario Power Generation's
operating generating capacity will be "in play" by the end of the first
 quarter, company President and Chief Executive Ron Osborne said Monday.

 As reported, the oil-and-natural gas burning Lennox plant near Kingston,
and the coal-fired Lakeview generating plant in Mississauga have joined the
 Bruce nuclear plant on Ontario Power's divestiture list.

 Osborne said Ontario Power would like to auction the 2,140-megawatt Lennox
and 1,140-MW Lakeview plants before November, when Ontario's
 competitive electricity market is due to start.

 He refused to speculate on the plants' market values.

 "When added to the 2,700 megawatts of planned independent generation in
Ontario, and to the 1,700 megawatts that independent generators
 supply today, and the roughly 4,000 megawatts that can be brought into the
province through interconnections, by this time next year we could see
 up to 15,000 megawatts provided by other companies," Osborne said in a
luncheon speech.

 The company chose to put Lennox and Lakeview on the block because they are
peaking plants and thus frequently set prices in Ontario's near
 monopoly wholesale market, Osborne explained after his speech.

 Ontario Power has agreed to give up wholesale market share to enable more
competitors to participate in the upcoming spot market.

 The company must first "decontrol" or give up control over 4,000 MW of
price-setting plants, typically coal-fired or hydro powered.

 Lennox, whose four 535-MW oil-fired units have recently been reconfigured
to burn natural gas as well, is known as Ontario's "last-on, first-off"
plant
 because it is run when electricity demand is greatest.

 As for Lakeview, four of its eight coal-fired units aren't operational.

 The plant, located west of Toronto in Mississauga, was supposed to be the
site of a new natural-gas fired generating station called Lakeview New
 Generation. The project, announced in December 1998, was to be developed by
Ontario Power, Calgary-based Atco Power and two Ontario
 municipal utilities.

 One of the four partners, municipal distributor Hydro Mississauga, recently
withdrew from the project.

 A spokesman for Ontario Power said any sale of the site would likely
involve negotiations for the new gas project. "But as far as the partners
are
 concerned, it's still a viable proposition they're looking into," said the
spokesman.

 If Ontario Power's Bruce A nuclear station can be brought back into service
either by the company or by a new investor, "this would also contribute
 another 3,000 megawatts of clean electricity" to the provincial supply
picture, said Osborne.

 The company has met with "several potential partners" in its Bruce nuclear
plant and expects to report to its shareholder, the provincial government,
 in the next few weeks, he said.

 Jake Brooks, spokesman for Independent Power Producers Society of Ontario,
said the two divestitures announced Monday are important.

 "These are large enough power plants that it's a good step towards breaking
up the concentration of ownership in the power sector," he said.

 Ontario Power's small hydro-electric plants are also rumored to be for
sale, he said. It makes sense that the company would try to sell those, too,
 because they're best run by small operators, said Brooks.

 IPPSO's concern is that the divestitures be conducted in as open a manner
as possible, said Brooks.

 "And as we've said before, any proceeds over book value should be dedicated
to paying down the stranded debt of the former Ontario Hydro," he
 added.

 Ontario Power is the largest of five successor companies to Ontario Hydro,
which left behind a legacy of C$38.1 billion in outstanding debt and other
 liabilities when it was split up in April 1999.

 The successor companies are responsible for paying of a portion of that
debt, but the provincial finance ministry estimates C$7.8 billion of the
total
 is "residual stranded debt" that will likely be borne by electricity
customers.

This memo documents the timing of when we set aside reserves for the Colorado 
Springs Utility deal.  It also documents the history of money flowing into 
and out of Matt Motley's P&L.  This is simply an fyi -- there is no action 
needed from you.

The net effect is that we have a $10 million reserve set up for CSU.  With 
respect to trader performance, $5.2 of that came from when Kevin McGowan 
managed the book (his entire ytd earnings before he moved to coal) and $4.8 
came from Motley's P&L.  I thought it would be useful to record it in a 
quasi-official manner to give Motley comfort that he won't get dinged for an 
old shitty deal that happened before he arrived.

Well, to date it looks like we're just over $176,000.  Way to go!

Thank you to everybody that has contacted Michael and I regarding

donations that have been reported to date.  This should give you a good
idea of where we're at.  Please take a look at it - if you have any
comments please let me know.

We have not heard from a few of you yet, and rumor has it that there are
still a few donations that haven't been reported to us.  Please e-mail
me or phone us by Tuesday with the name and $$ amount of the expected
donation and we will ensure they get proper credit in the brochure etc.

Regards,

Kelly Trout and Michael Leahy

Subject: Requested information on Transport

John,

I want to update you on the additional information you requested yesterday 
(intrinsic and extrinsic $ assigned to each deal when originally booked).  

Due to changes in personnel, the time that has elapsed, and the Excel model 
used in the original valuation of the deals, obtaining the initial values has 
proven to be more of a challenge than I had initially anticipated.  I am 
working with the current book administrators for the transport model to pull 
together what information we can find.  I have also spoken with Colleen and 
placed phone calls to the prior (and original) administrator of the transport 
option model.

I am not sure, at this point, that we will be able to pin down the original 
values for all of the deals.  I will get you what I can, as soon as I can.  
In the meantime, please let me know if you have questions and/or concerns.

Greg

Jane,

Sorry for the delay.   Please be advised of the following:

De Geurin Realty, Inc

Houston,  TX   77057

Contact:  Phyllis Peak (I believe Phyllis worked with David Oxley)
713-789-9999 - Office -
713-528-5801 - Home -

or

Greenwood-King Properties
3200 Kirby, Suite 200
Houston, TX   77098

Contact:  Jacque Morris
713-524-1228 - Office

Both of the above can provide the services requested.  I am not sure of the

Thanks.

John has asked me about hiring someone who will handle all the little matters 
of getting electricity and phone hook-ups, mail forwarding, etc.  Is there a 
company that can do this?  What kind of fees are usual?  David Oxley 
mentioned that his real estate agent did all of this.....

John, I've been meaning to drop you a note to say thanks for the golf
weekend, but things have been a little crazy since I've been back.
Shannon's mom passed away last Wednesday, so I was on a plane to Thunder Bay
within a couple of hours and up there until Sunday night.

It was great seeing you, Dina, Michael and Rich.  He's a great kid (Michael,
not Rich).  Please give my thanks to DIna again.  By the way, are you
missing a car key?  I just unpacked my golf bag and there was a key chain in
the golf travel bag with a BMW key on it.  My intuitive mind tells me that
the key is probably yours.  Give me your mailing address and I'll send it
down to you.

Mark

I said at yesterday's meeting that I would get back to you concerning the 
speed issues of the V@R calculations - here's the response...

I spoke with Steve Stock, the Director of RAC systems.  He agreed that there 
are performance problems and this is being addressed in a technology review 
being conducted by my application architecture group.  There are plans to 
re-architect the application so it can handle real time calculations.  Once 
the results of the review are known - I will be more than happy to share them 
with you.  The V@R process currently takes 11 hours from start to finish.  We 
also find this unacceptable!

Also, the front end is very slow in accessing data.  There is a new front end 
in development that will address these problems.

I'll keep you posted as new developments occur.

Beth

John,

FYI Clickpaper should be up and running by the end of the month.  We will be 
quoting mostly the same products as we currently do in EOL (except longer 
term and one new physical offering).  We will also continue to make quotes on 
EOL but probably with a wider spread.

Some newsprint stuff for you.  As with any other commodity, the inventories 
and operating rate/capacity are the key drivers.

		 Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list

Phillip,
 Below is the issues & to do list as we go forward with documenting the 
requirements for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport 
trade capture. What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; 
the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, 
on Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic 
consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time 
consuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the 
inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the 
consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can 
arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to 
happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the 
consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude 
building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the 
future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm 
requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project 
plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. 
The other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to 
themselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this 
project.

I have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been 
good. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now 
we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.

Subject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list


>From our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated 
positions, I think we still have the following issues:
We don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had 
three meetings which brought out very different issues from different 
traders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader 
requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.
We're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to 
be outside the scope of position consolidation.

Things left to do:
I think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to 
make it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this 
project.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.
Go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this 
project and which fall out of scope.
For those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and 
work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.
Define the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all 
drill downs.
Use the above to formulate a project plan.

Things requested thus far (no particular order):
Inclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal 
ticker.
Customized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that 
add up existing position manager rows/columns).
New drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, 
transport, swaps, options, ...
Addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values 
of all curves on which the desk has a position.
Ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be 
shown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid 
would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.
Ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the 
appropriate positions to show for each:
Gas Daily for monthly index,
Physical gas for Nymex,
Physical gas for Inside Ferc,
Physical gas for Mid market.
Ability for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of 
using official valuations.
Position and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.
Ability to include the Gas Price book into TDS:
Inclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility 
skew and correlations.
Ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  
Approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a 
gamma grid.
Valuation of Gas Daily options.
A new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.
Inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.
Ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position 
manager.
Ability to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, 
prior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.
Eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.
Position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of 
individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.
Benchmark positions in TDS.
Deployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit 
and explicit position break out issues.

-- Allan.

PS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for 
transport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that 
point.

You should include VP's and also you should make it a little clearer that I 
don't want to be on the schedule unless they have made a decision.

Book this deal very conservatively.  ie.  set the curve so you pay credit 
reserve but show no income.  We will discuss in 2001.

The 2000 Federal Budget was recently announced.  Here are some of the 
highlights that you might find interesting:

Stock Options:

The amount of the stock option benefit reported as income is reduced from 3/4 
to 2/3 on options exercised after February 27, 2000.  In other words, 33% is 
not taxable (was 25%).

Tax Rates:

Basic personal exemption will increase to $7,231 (currently $7,131)
this change will be effective on the July 1-15 pay and will be doubled for 
the remainder of 2000

Spousal amount is increasing to $6,140 (currently $6,055)

The new tax rate structure for 2000:

17% of taxable income up to $30,004 (was $29,590)
25% of taxable income between $30,004 and $60,009 (was $29,590 to $59,180)
29% of taxable income in excess of $60,009 (was $59,180)

Limits to Foreign Content Increased:

Despite a "hot tip" that RRSP contribution limits would be raised in this 
year's budget, it did not happen.  However, the foreign content limit for 
RPPs and RRSPs is increased from 20% to 25% for 2000 and to 30% for 2001.

Call me if you would like any further information.

The number of trades doesn't seem to match between your presentation and the 
spreadsheet data.  The spreadsheet shows 17 power trades this year and your 
presentation shows almost that many every month.  Same comment for the gas 
side.

John,
  In an attempt to keep you informed, Gary Hickerson is bringing in a

Agribusiness Consultant role.  Mark will be on contract for a 6 month period 
and may be brought on full time pending his success.  His rate of pay is 
equivalent to $80k annually.  If  Enron breaks the contract within three 
months Mark will be paid a breakage fee of 20k.  If contract is broken after 
three months Mark will be paid the amount remaining under his agreement.   If 
Mark is hired full time during this contract there will be no associated fee 
involved.

In the future, if you have a message regarding John Lavorato's schedule, 
could you please send it to me instead of sending it to John.  

Also, you did not provide the time, however, Kay Chapman indicated that the 
meeting will take place at 2:00 p.m.  John is not available at 2:00 p.m.

Thank you

Kim

Chris,

We will not be able to publish a preliminary DPR or position report for 
10/31.  Port Calc has suffered a serious code crash, and the numbers 
generated are erroneous.  Our IT support will be working through the night to 
repair the code (Zhiyong's group), and hopefully by tomorrow morning we will 
be able to rerun an official book.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to call.

Thanks,

I think it's time to review our disaster plan with respect to trading as we 
enter hurrincane season.  As I understand, there is no real cohesive plan, or 
course of action.  We could think about the Chicago office as an evacuation 
site for redundant trading, etc. This issue affects all businesses, and Sally 
and I have been talking about this problem.  John, should I get in touch with 
Phillippe or do anything else? 

Jeff

Sir,

I could not e-mail these reports to Kimberly Hillis as usual because I was 
getting the mail returned for insufficient disk space.  Kimberly should be 
able to print from your e-mail.  I also sent a back-up copy to Tim's 
assistant Debra Davidson just in case something happens.

Subject: Initial Thoughts On Alberta

As a result of meetings in Calgary last week, I have come up with the 
following capabilities that we need to develop in Calgary to effectively 
trade, schedule, and settle in that market.  I envision a series of 
transition teams, organized by function, that are responsible for 
transferring systems, knowledge, and people from the east and west power 
desks up to the Calgary office.  These are my initial thoughts.  Things will 
obviously change as we learn more about the market rules and when we get the 
head of the desk in place.

Trading
Transition team - Tim Belden, Mike Swerzbin, Bill Greenizen
Hire head trader.  John L. and Tim are currently working with John Zufferli 
to guage interest and come to terms on relocation.  John Z. is planning a 
trip to Portland and Calgary as soon as he is able to fly.  Hopefully the 
week of September 16th.
Get EOL products defined and posted.  Greenizen hopes to get this done by 
September 16th.
Develop curves.  Currently using implied PPA bid curves.
Develop position reports.
Give offers to origination team.  Tim/Mike/Bill will provide prices to 
origination until head trader has been hired.

Risk
Transition team - Monica Lande and Kathy ??
Kathy traveled to Portland on 9/5 and 9/6 to learn about our risk process and 
book deals.
Book positions.  In process of entering five deals.  One for each unit, line 
losses for each unit, and payment for the PPA.  Will run mini book to ensure 
that close to zero value is created when all deals are booked and run against 
our curves.  Should have this done by September 8th.
Drop curves.
Create position reports.

Scheduling
Transition team - Jeff Richter, Bill Greenizen, Peggy H.
Learn and define scheduling requirements in Alberta.
Learn about California scheduling systems.
Assess applicability of California scheduling systems to Alberta market.
Hire a scheduler.

Real Time
Transition team - John Forney
Assess whether we need to run real time group in Calgary.  We may be able to 
start with someone on days and have nights and weekends covered from 
Portland.  Legal issues with Portland providing service to Calgary.
Assuming we want a real time person in Calgary ... hire a RT trader/analyst.  
We may be able to draw from Portland's real time desk for this.

Fundamentals
Transition team - Tim Heizenrader and Stephan ??, and Chris Wiebe
We can use the Portland fundamentals team to do much of the work before 
January.  We have the systems and most likely the staff to come up with the 
first generation of Alberta fundamentals.
Train a person who will eventually be located in Calgary on West Power 
Fundamentals -- systems and processes.  Stephan or Chris W. may fit this 
bill.  Must get buy in from Heizenrader and head trader.
We have a person in Houston, Sanjeev Khanna, who used to work for Enmax and 
now works for structuring in Houston.  He is not interested in relocating to 
Calgary, but would like to help us learn about the market.
Should consider trying to hire industry expertise from local utility.  Derek 
will work on this.  Sanjeev may have some ideas here.
Establish better network connections between Portland and Calgary.  Dan 
Dietrich.

Volume Management
Transition team - Murray O'Neil, Peggy H., Laura Scott
Learn market rules for settlements.  Get 1 person from Derek's group to try 
to spell out the settlements formulas on both the pool side and the contract 
side.
Compare Alberta Power Pool settlements procedures to California settlements 
and determine whether Volume Management system will do the job.
Come up with a manual backup plan until VM system will work.
Hire someone to do volume management in Calgary.  We are currently assessing 
whether anyone from Portland could do this job.


I will be out of the office until September 16th.  We have already made plans 
for Bill G, Kathy, Peggy, and Laura to come to Portland to check out our 
systems and processes.  Shortly after I return we should be able to nail down 
the head trader position.  Tim Heizenrader will call Sanjeev to see if there 
is a role for him to play in our Fundamental Analysis effort.  It may be 
worth waiting until the head trader is in place to do this.

I'm off to Montana for a week.  Debra Davidson will be able to get in touch 
with me.  She can be reached at 503-464-3820.

Regards,
Tim

I have been requesting that the Canadian gas reports be broken down by trader 
for a while.  I am not comfortable not knowing the P/L or positions by trader 
in Canada.  Why is this not done yet and how can I help get it done.

John:

In the past couple weeks, Janelle Scheuer has been contacted about a couple 
job opportunities. Initially by someone on the crude desk offering her a job 
to head
their marketing group. Jeff Shankman followed up to encourage her to become a 
candidate for the job. Separately, Fred LaGrasta approached Janelle to ask if
she would be interested in coming back to work for him in Breslau's 
Industrial Group. 

My concern is  that none of these individuals provided me the courtesy to 
check if it would be appropriate to discuss job opportunities with Janelle. 
Given that she has been in power for only  5 months and is performing a 
critical role in our effort to increase deal flow, I will be in a bind if I 
loose her. Janelle did the right thing by divulging this information. I 
wanted you to be aware of this.

Thanks,   Ed

I view my bonus as partly attributable to my own trading and partly to the 
group's performance.  Here are my thoughts.

Here are Mike's numbers.  I have not made any adjustments to them.

I have given him an "expectations" speech, but you might do the same at some 
point.

John, below are several issues I wanted to bring to your attention prior to 
finalizing merit increases for East Power.  I have also given David Oxley the 
same information in order for you to discuss this morning when you meet.  
Call me if you have any questions.

 M. Dana Davis's employment agreement will expire in February 28, 2001.  I 
imagine we will want to renew with the new salary on the employment 
agreement.  K Presto would like to recommendation that we give him a $20,000 
increase.


Rogers Herndon' s employment agreement  will expire September 14, 2001.  Do 
we want to renew earlier and roll the base salary changes (if any) into the 
employment agreement. Kevin Presto would like to give him a $15,000 increase.


Who will be responsible for John Zufferli's increase (if any ) since he 
transferred to Canada and now has been promoted to VP.



Rob Benson was given a significant increase in the global comp system at the 
insistence of K.Presto.  Kevin states that John Lavorato indicated to him 
that Benson needed to be taken care of.  With that being said Kevin would 
like to bring him up more in line with a commerical director, which he was 
just promoted to.  His employment agreement will expire 2/1/01.  So would it 
also make sense to delete him from the merit database and renew an employment 
agreement rolling in his new salary?



Finally, I need you to decide on Chris Dorland's new salary.  He is currently 
making $81,000 and I have recommended $90,000.  He is an Associate that is 
being made a commerical manager.  He was ranked superior and Presto has 
indicated that he is expecting around $100,000.  Presto finally settled on 
$95,000 provided you concur.  Our plan prior was slightly stagger salaries 
for individuals as associates promoted to commercial manager based on final 
rankings.  ($85,000 strong, $87,500 for excellent, $90,000 for superior). The 
guideline from the program is $86,000 but is left up to the business unit 
discretion.

I would like to request an additional 15 million var for gas.  Prices have 
exploded and I'm working on it.

Rick

I thought I would give you an update on what I am doing from a systems 
perspective.  I'm trying to get a systems plan together from Beth.  We simple 
do not have one.  From there I will coordinate with traders and back office 
to try to create a plan that everyone can by off on.  My new motto is 
"Systems will be fixed or people will die".  I will keep you informed.

John

Okay fellow deputies, where are your prizes?

I can only assume that the prizes you've collected are so great you can't
bear to part with them because to date I have only received two balloon
prizes from you.  I know there are more out there so please send them to my
attention at CXY Energy Marketing, 2400, 205 - 5th Avenue S.W., Bow Valley
Square 2, Calgary AB T2P 2V7.

In order for the prize donors to be recognized in the brochure to be handed
out at the party I need to know who is donating what by no later than Friday
January 21st in order to meet our publishing deadline.  I will collect
prizes up until Wednesday January 26th but any entries after the 21st may
not be recognized in the brochure.

The balloon sale is a very easy way for us to raise $3000.  Our goal is to
have prizes in one third of the balloons which requires each deputy to
collect at least two prizes.  It's as easy as asking your favorite
restaurant, hairdresser, massage therapist or wine store to donate a gift
certificate.

If you have any questions or need more suggestions feel free to give me a
call at 260-3441.

Thanks very much,

Maggie

John,
I've had a couple of questions regarding ROCE, and trader's goals.  If it is 
okay with you, I would like to see the goals and objectives you laid out to 
be of better service to desk heads.  Right now I'm goal searching so that I 
can be better.  This type of information may help me in formulating a game 
plan.  I understand that all you've ever asked for is that the traders 
understand VAR, and that VAR be more accurate, but I'm trying to take this 
risk management game to the next level.

Let me know if this works for you if not maybe we could discuss this later 
...maybe over beers..

Frank

No not a promise but it more or less went like this:  Kathy:  "Lavo, you have 
caused me a lot of grief by taking both Ryan and Chad, you wouldn't believe 
the overtime I had to work.  I should get some kind of hiring bonus or 
something".  John:  "Well if you go three for three you're on".

I have read that the average cost of hiring/training someone is approx 
$80,000.  I am willing to accept much less than this.  Actually I don't 
really expect anything I just thought I would give it a shot.

Kathy

Following up on our summit.  I wrote down that you would follow up on the 
synergies or lack there of between the research group and the group run by

Same a mid year

I'm smarter than everyone else.

Just in Case

*  Managed a Trading group that is up 2 Billion (more if you included hits 
taken) - probably not due to me.
*  Left a lot of money in Canada - some is still there.
*  Led the PPA deal - which I will resign and buy personally if you want to 
turn it back.
*  Created the Gas Fundamentals Group which every business unit is copying.
* Came up with LTP which everybody hates but will fix our trader shortage in 
the future and every company is copying.
*  Trained many great young kids in Calgary that are now key players in 
Houston.
*  Created structure and communication around our system strategy - brought 
traders, IT, and back office together to create a plan that everyone has 
bought into.  The future success is unclear but the exercise was very 
worthwhile.
*  Had very few VAR violations and helped improve our understanding and 
reporting of VAR.  Completed mended the relationship between gas trading and 
the risk group.
*  Should get most credit for the increase in power trades on EOL and the 
continuation of the increase in Gas.
*  Turned the East Power group into a focused trading group not a think tank 
that bets on July-Aug power price - Still nowhere near completion.
*  Put a halt on the hiring of unqualified people - Have spent many hours 
devising a plan to bring in qualified - experience people.  You will see this 
implemented in 2001.
*  Experimented with the "Pay PRC"  which I think was very successful.  I 
think this will start our organization to think a little differently and 
hopefully in a way that will benefit us.
*  Possibly the best accomplishment is "Killing the Dragon".

I'm glad you made me write this list down because for the first time in 
months I realized that I was smiling while I was writing.

Regards

John

A couple of questions.

1.  Where did the Gas Trading P/L derive from this month.

2.  How are you coming on the position reports we discussed.

Talk to you soon.

Dale,

Further to my phone call this morning, I have contacted John Watts at Avista 
requesting a copy of the Force Majeure letter they are sending to APEA.  I 
will forward this as soon as I receive it.  The event in this case is 
preventative maintenance.  It appears that there are stress fractures in 
certain of Clark's generation equipment.  GE is installing equipment to 
assess the problem.  The installation and removal of this equipment will 
involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks.  The question is:  
Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the 
APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?

Thanks for your help,

Laird

We need to hedge funds.

		 Subject: EOL/ Hedge Funds

Most of the macro hedge funds want to trade global crude products and gas 
options immediately.  However,  I am having a big problem getting Tudor and 
like funds up and running on EOL-

Problems:
#1: Credit- major back-log on new names - we don't have enough resources to 
deal with these names (the structures of the funds can be complex- not like 
dealing with industrials).  
#2: With those that we have docs, credit has said we can not trade on-line. 
(???)

The only differences I see with funds trading online is that their trades 
need to go to credit's (Bill Bradford's group) to be included in daily MTM 
and 5 day VAR reports.  We calculate variation margin off these reports so 
its essential credit gets the trades...

AND

In the case of Tudor, they allocate trades between funds- the EOL trades 
would need to go to me or the backoffice, so we could allocate them.

I think the EOL reporting issues can easily be resolved- the credit back log 
is the real killer at the moment.

Rgds,
Caroline

We will wear the ICAP position with the following marks that represent the 
true mid.

 2001 2.00 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2002 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2003 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)

These new marks result in $9 million of incremental value that will hit 
Dana's P&L tonight.   Based on our discussion earlier, East Power (Dana 
specifically) is now fully wearing this position and fully assumes all 
downside and upside associated with the position.

As mentioned in our report last week, AB1X is expected to pass the Senate 
later this week.  Lawmakers were busy over the weekend and yesterday marking 
up the bill.  One change includes the Department of Water Resources will use 
a "weighted average" price of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour instead of the 5.5 
cents per kilowatt hour price cap.   

Another bill is currently being drafted by Assemblyman Keeley and Sen. Battin 
allowing QFs to sell electricity at 8 cents per kilowatt hour (down from 18 
cents) to Socal.  The bill stemmed from a series of negotiations that have 
been taking place with CA government officials.  However, a source close to 
the negotiations confirms that  PG&E was not involved in the meetings. 

Per Friday's update, negotiations continue on a bond issuance plan but sides 
remain divided on amount and if it would include the internal debt of the 
parent companies or just debt due to external creditors.

So I'm working some magic for Friday.  I think we are going to play a private 
men only club for free (except for caddie fees).  I figure the downside is 
that we get pummled and left for dead.  I'll let you know.

Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the years, 
it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Regards
Delainey

I have asked the crude group to give a presentation on fuel oil supply and 
demand which will take place Wednesday July 12 at 2:15 in the big boardroom 
on the 30th floor. I would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders 
that you think would benefit from it.

Thinking about bull move, the only trade I really like is being long physical 
and short NYMEX.  If you believe that NYMEX is doing a "buzz lightyear" 
(infinity and beyond), the next question is where does that put the cash.  
Back in '95, Chicago cash went to $40 and merc died out sub 5 dollars.  Also, 
'95 had a huge geographic basis rift, the structural shift had Z3 trading 
about $1.50 over Waha.  On the upside, cash will suffer constraints, causing 
demand spikes. On the downside, cash shouldn't materially outpace NYMEX.

Reviewing geographic arbs and considering the east coast political 
environment (high potential for congressional intervention) as well as ok-ish 
storage, the East may be the best basis sell vs. a long west trade (Waha I'm 
uncertain about, particularly if the cold doesn't hit Texas...Chicago might 
be better given what's going on there except for the Alliance issue...Socal 
appears to be the best geographic long...PGE citygate could really rock given 
storage and increase supply competition given Alliance PL...    The 
Z6/Chicago spread is trading around $1.56 for the winter  (FH) and  approx. a 
dime in today's intra-month.   The Z6 vs. NGI-PGE/CG spread has the Jan-Mar 
around .94 cents, Z6 over. Intra-month it is trading at $2.43, PGE/CG over 
Z6   (I'm waiting on additional stats, but I think I like this trade...)

Additionally, playing the '95 scenario, we should be long every basis 
downstream of Henry and short something else, maybe NYMEX, Waha, Katy  
(notice smaller font)   I'm still reviewing economic stats regarding the 
drivers to these trades such as, Sable Island, LNG, Chippewa (Canadian 
imports) and Chicago/California storage . As well as evaluating which 
geography would be the best buy....

Preliminary trades  (let me know which ones strike your interest and I'll 
focus my analysis..)

Long NGI-PGE/CG, Short Z6
Long CNG North Valley,  Short Z6
Long NGPL Lousiana pool, short MOPS, TETCO STX
Long CGT, short NYMEX  (not very exciting, small basis)
Long Z6, short Chippewa
Long physical, short NYMEX  

Still looking, still thinking,  but gun-to-my-head....

Now that we sent the first blow, lets get everyone together to discuss our 
future steps.  Next week is a nighmare but perhaps you could set  up a 
conference call sometime Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.  

Also, did Blakes definately drop us on this file or have they reconsidered.

A funny story:
Because Access was up 75 cents last night, Nymex made a trading limit of 
unchanged to +150.  After 20 minutes of trading, we were at unchanged and the 
exchange stopped trading for an hour.  
Rappaport, the exchange president, was standing by to make sure everything 
was orderly.  Obviously, the locals weren't too happy about the exchange 
closing.  One yelled at Rappaport...
"Why don't you take your million dollar bonus and go buy Enron stock"

Good Morning Mr. Lavorato,

I am e-mailing you to give you an update on the appraisal process.
Both appraisers went in to see the property on Friday June 16, 2000.  We are 
expecting one written report today and the other one tomorrow.  We should be 
in a position to give you your guarantee price by the middle of next week.

I was advise by Cendant Mobility that your spouse's first name is Dina.  
Please advise me if this is not the correct spelling of her name.  I will 
correct it in our system.   You can contact me by return e-mail at 
Pfournie@Royallepage2.com or by phone at 416-386-6028 or 1-800-410-2983 ext. 
6028
Since I'm not totally sure at this point if your family has already vacated 
the property in Calgary so I don't want to send any documents there.   I am 
attaching three documents to this e-mail so that you have them with you .

The first document is the offer information form and disclosure statement.  
Since this document forms part of the guaranteed offer,  and would ask you to 
please complete this document and return it to me by fax by Monday June 
26th.  My fax# is 416-448-6358.

The second document is a blank guarantee offer.   This document will be used 
in the event that you are able to negotiate a verbal agreement with a buyer 
prior to a guarantee price being established.
If this situation occurs, please insert the agreed upon price and sign the 
RLRS Offer,.  Return it by fax , along with the Power of Attorney which forms 
part of this package.
Once these documents are received by RLRS, we are in a legal position to sign 
an offer on your home showing RLRS as the vendor.

The last document is the amended sale program  procedures . This is the 
relocation program that has been approved by your company for your 
relocation. It outlines in detail the procedures to be followed under that 
program.
It is a program that has been designed by the I.R.S. and the U.S. relocation 
council to deal with the issues of relocation and taxable benefits.
One thing that I want to you to remember is that if you have an offer on your 
property,  you must negotiate it verbally and please do not signed nor 
initial anything on the offer.  Once you have come to a verbal agreement  
with a purchaser, Royal Lepage will sign that offer on your behalf.

You can contact me at the office between 8:00 to 4:00 or leave a voice mail 
message anytime.

I will be on vacation next week June 26th to June 30th. If you need 
assistance during that week please contact Jessica Desouza at 416-510-5764 or 
you can use the 800# and ask for ext. 5764.  Jessica will contact you next 
week with your guarantee price.

Could you also please e-mail me your mailing address where to courier your 
guaranteed offer.

Do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions

Thank you,

Patricia Fournier
Relocation Consultant

Dear Deputy:

Jim Murphy has asked me to pass on some exciting news about the silent 
auction prizes:

The Medieval dinner/murder mystery prize is now complete.  As you will 
recall, this prize for twelve people is a gourmet dinner and murder mystery, 
with full medieval costumes provided.  The Palliser Hotel has now kindly 
donated 6 hotel rooms for our diners to retire to and Sunday brunch for 
twelve the next morning, to complete the prize,

Jim tells me he is inches away from clinching the NBA package.  You will 
recall that he has 10 Grizzly tickets, accomodation for 10 in Vancouver and

The attached spreadsheet outlines the remaining income (assuming no further 
recovery) to be recorded on Blue Range.  There is an issue regarding the 
foreign exchange on the Houston reserve as detailed on this spreadsheet.  
Canada's position is that this is a Canadian dollar denominated transaction 
and we should be kept whole on the Canadian dollars.  Please review, Wanda, 
and let me know if you have any questions.  



Milly, I wouldn't quite have writtin this the way Laura did.  Let's talk.

Subject: Global Risk Management

On Friday, May 5, 2000 , Rick Buy and Jeff Skillling signed a memo 
designating John Lavorato (Western Hemishere) and John Sherriff (Eastern 
Hemisphere)
as the responsible parties for signing the Daily Positiion Report.  Please 
obtain Greg Whalley's approval for all DPR's prior to that date.  Going 
forward, please coordinate with each as to their preferred method of 
designating approval.  I assume you will use e-mail until such time that the 
Executive Reports Viewer can be changed to accomodate this change.  I will 
also assume that you are working on that solution unless otherwise informed.  

John Sherriff/John Lavorato
The memo was exactly as had been sent to you in draft form.  Responsibility 
for LNG continues to be somewhat unclear, however, as it pertains to global 
risk oversight, John Sherriff is officially responsible until further notice.

Any questions, please call me at 3-3324

Eric can you please forward this note to John Lavorato, I was speaking with
him this morning and I just wanted to pass my thoughts on through.  I
squeezed Ken Yewell in our office for your e-mal address.  Thanks./Lonnie
(TransAlta)

 PPA's -

John, yes you are right the negative bids will not be paid out as a lump
sum (credit issues), they will be paid out on a simple flat monthly basis (
I suppose you could use this cash flow to finance a purchase of positive
bid plants,  of course you would need to incorporate the appropriate
discounting).  Even without the alternative of taking the money and
running, you can still use the purchase of a negative value plant as a call
option on the market - the premium is the 3 month penalty payment outlined
in the auction process.

The company, Charles River Associates, has helped develop this wonderful
system (Maybe that's why their stock price has dropped 30% in the past week
- actually its earnings related, but who really knows).  The auction was
also developed by a group going by the name "Auction Design Inc" I think.

With the 13 or so PPA's and with a portion being negative we should have a
very interesting auction in the first week of July.  My understanding is
that the Minister has the unilateral right to declare the auction a success
or failure even if only 50% of the plants are bid.  To date there has been
considerable thinking around the issue of what do you do if the plants
don't get auctioned off, but I haven't heard anything concrete on
solutions.  I assume that if it's close the Minister will be forced to
declare it a success politically and then try for some re-auction for the
remaining plants and throw the rest into the balancing pool - or some
hybrid of that.

In reality it should be very easy to declare the auction a success, even if
one $400 million plant gets auctioned off the balancing pool will look
positive - the rest of the plants could then be auctioned in smaller annual
bits and the balancing pool would be used to "balance" the cash flows to
the owners.  If the balancing pool becomes negative - the DOE could add a
surcharge on EAL's tariffs and if positive - could send the cash into
general revenues.

Wish you luck - and when you win one of these I will forward to you the 5
techniques for gaming a pool.

Lonnie

Hi all

Just wanted to ensure everyone is proceeding with their ticket sales. If
you're having problems selling (more than 3 tickets left over) then
please email everyone what you have, otherwise you should be able to
manage to sell 3 or less tickets to someone between now and next Friday.

As a reminder, requests for Corporate Sponsor tickets go to Chris
Bishop. Make sure requests are made early as we will start to sell them
over the course of the week.

Thnaks

Bill

Kyle is working on the PPA.  However, Dave and I told Kyle that unless he can 
get Fastow to sign something that we can walk on the counterparty (in 
otherwords that it is truly non recourse) we are not interested.  

Let me know if we are missing something.

Subject: Approval for transfer to EBS

John:

My name is Husnain Mirza. I have been working for ENA as Senior Specialist.  
I work in Andrea Reed's group, and report to her through L'Sheryl Hudson.  On 
August 8th, on behalf of Andrea Reed, L'Sheryl Hudson told me that with the 
dissolution of CTG, Andrea's group would change significantly and that there 
would be  no growth opportunities for me in this group. I was told that I 
should look for opportunities and growth elsewhere. 

After talking to numerous people in Enron, I found someone who told me to go 
to EBS. In EBS I approached Paul Trieschman of HR and Larry Lawyer. Paul 
Trieschman said he would check in EBS and forward my resume to people who 
might be looking to fill in vacant positions. Larry sent me to Ravi 
Thuraisingham, who was looking for someone with telecom background. Ravi 
talked to Jim Fallon, who was also looking for someone with telecom 
background. 

My background in Williams Communications Group, Inc., and specifically 
working on Fibre build business plan and related subjects, like cost study of 
fibre capacity, provided a direct fit with the position that Ravi and Jim 
wanted to fill. Ravi, after asking what I had done at Williams 
Communications, went to discuss my background with Jim Fallon. In the 
afternoon he called and made me an offer to join EBS. I accepted the offer. 
He told me that the projects that I will be doing are about Fibre build.

Upon receiving the offer, I went to Andrea Reed and told her about the offer 
and the excellent fit that this position has with my telecom background.  I 
told her that this position gives me great opportunity to make contribution 
to Enron's broadband efforts. Andrea, knowing that there are no growth 
opportunities for me in her group,  said she fully supports my transfer to 
EBS. She has already called Paul Racicot and told him of her support for my 
transfer to EBS (Please see Andrea's email below).  

Jim Fallon and Paul Racicot, understandably, are very sensitive about my 
transfer to EBS. They want to finally check it with you and get your support 
for my transfer. Everything related to my transfer has been finalised, except 
that Jim and Paul want to hear directly from you and get your approval.  
Andrea Reed fully supports my transfer and has no concerns about it. I would 
appreciate if you could O'K my transfer to EBS. I do not want to miss this 
opportunity, and would like to start as soon as possible.

Regards,

Husnain Mirza

My gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well 
with the current strategic direction of Enron (Although I'm sure they are 
very high quality individuals).  If its not too late, I wonder if we should 
slightly scale back the number of Associates that we are attempting to hire.  
I'm not sure that Dave and I need that many individuals that are focused on 
International business.

Regards 

John

If they are so screwed why can't we get a couple million in fees.

Also, remember that the Canadian commericial group wears the debt not the

Sorry to hear you were "under the weather" yesterday.  I just wanted to 
confirm that the 1000 lot trade you did with Mike Maggie should go to your 
power book.  That is where it is being captured, if this is not correct, 
please let me know.

Kori.

I hope that the following clears up some of the  confusion regarding the 
above-captioned process.

Factor loadings are an input to Value-at-Risk (VAR).  Generally, you can 
consider them the determinants of relationships between curves,and points on 
curves based on trader inputs.   These pertain to all curves not just North 
American Natural Gas.  There is a specific program which calculates these 
relationships which requires a considerable amount of processing time (3 
hours per run) as well as another few man-days to evaluate the results.  

There is no "ideal" or recommended period in which these must be updated.  
More frequent is "better".  Given the amount of time it takes to refresh, it 
was "agreed" a long time ago amongst  RAC, Research, IT and Operations that 
it would be done every 2 weeks.  No commercial input was received.  The roles 
were to be simple as they are with most roles in and around VAR and other 
risk management controls: 

 Research specifies the math
 IT codes the program
 Operations runs the program
 RAC evaluates the results 

The process has been run every two weeks on the second Thursday of every 
month since February (as it had been prior) and RAC has rejected the results 
because the results did not reflect the underlying math because of the 
complexity of the math and the continuing addition of new products and 
curves.  This  created the need to recode the application from scratch.   RAC 
continued to agitate to get this done, particularly knowing that the pressure 
on the efficacy of VAR would be questioned as we went into the volatile 
period of 2000 ( e-mails from Rudi Zipter available upon request).  The new 
code was implemented last Thursday and the results were accepted resulting in 
an approximate 10% difference in VAR.

RAC had requested that the code be re-written on 6/10/99 @ 7:44 am with a 
target completion date of  8/2/99.  This was discussed and accepted by 
Phillipe Bibi on 6/17/99 in a meeting in his conference room with Rick Buy, 
Dan Bruce, Jonathon Le, Ted Murphy, Bill Bradford, Debbie Brackett and Rudi 
Zipter along with the rest of our task list.  

We have resolved that the process will continue as stated and will 
communicate to you the results. 

There are dozens of other processes that are important to the calculation and 
interpretation of VAR that need to be implemented, enhanced, improved or 
rewritten altogether.  For example, the jump-diffusion factors for North 
American Power have not been refreshed in 2000.  The prioirty is dependent on 
the level of precision required. 

I will provide a comprehensive list of those processes in due course.

Subject: July 5 Grant Awards

To All:

Per Corporate Compensation, all miscellaneous stock awards (June submission 
-July Grant Awards) have been approved with a grant date of July 5.  These 
awards were approved at the closing price on July 5 - $66.4375, and at a 
Black - Scholes value of $25 for a 7 -  year term and $28 for a 10 - year 
term. 


The ratio for a 7-year option remains at  .365.  This ratio  will be reviewed 
and updated as needed and is subject to change. Please encourage the focus on 
the dollar value the equity grant is intened to deliver vs. how many options 
will be awarded.  With the volatility of Enron stock, the BSV can change from 
time to time, which could effect the number of options awarded.


Regards,
Jeanette

John,

As of Wednesday, we have a resource from Sun Microsystems that is helping  us 
isolate the problems we're having with the UNIX operating system and our 
code.  This resource has requested that we bring on an additional application 
specialist from SUN.  This has been authorized and the additional resource is 
scheduled to be on site next week.  I also have my resources and the UNIX 
administrators working along side the Sun resources.

As an aside, we are also experiencing performance problems with the gas side 
of the business.  I met with Sally Beck's controllers yesterday and we are 
putting a plan in place.  The increased trading volumes have seriously 
impacted our through put and we now have a 'blitz' on to correct the issues.

These problems have not gone unnoticed.  I assure you that IT has been very 
diligent in following through on these problems.  We're investing heavily in 
additional hardware, bringing in contractors and hiring additional resources 
at an average of 5 - 8 per week.  I will keep you posted as we continue to 
enhance our existing systems.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

Guys,
This Enpower calc issue is a joke.   How can we be the most Innovative 
Company in the world and cannot fix a risk book calculation problem.  
Furthermore, how can we effectively grow our volumes and complexity of our 
power transactions when our back office (risk books, position management, 
settlements) is so unreliable from an IT standpoint.

In addition, we will start losing all of our key people in this area because 
they are here until 8:30-9:00 every night and 4:00 pm on "holidays".  This 
whole issue is a significant business risk for Enron and needs to be dealt 
with accordingly.

Please advise.  Thank you.

Subject: Power Port Calc Issues

The Power risk group continues to experience severe instability with the 
power port calc.  The same memory allocation issue which I discussed in the 
message below is not resolved (we have had this problem for about four months 
now).  Due to business reasons, we calculated the east power books on Monday 
(Enron holiday).  We received all of the required data to calc by 9:30 AM and 
should have been completely done by 11:30.  However, the calc crashed six 
times and finally completed on the seventh try.  We were able to leave by 
4:00.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel that we are at such a 
state that there is risk that we could not provide positions to the traders 
by the start of the next business day.  This could have a financial impact on 
our company.  Once again, I am urgently and desperately asking for resolution 
of this problem.
Furthermore, it came to my attention on Friday that EES is now using EnPower 
and the power port calc and they too are using the same server that we are.  
I question this decision since we cannot seem to support the existing 
business that is using that server.  Per discussion with Kevin Presto, the 
agreement made regarding EES's use of EnPower was there would be no expense 
or degradation to ENA's business process.  I think they need to move to 
another server.
Please call to discuss when this will be resolved.  Thank You.

calcs on this machine (the second largest one).  Since an acceptable solution 
for the big power calc has not been provided to us, athena CANNOT be taken 
away from us.  The east power calc crashed 3 out of 5 days last week.  We 
usually start calcing at about 4:00.  The calc time is now running at 1.5 
hours and we have about 1.5 hours' worth of work after the calc's successful 
completion.  So you do the math on what time my group leaves the building 
when the calc crashes at 4:30.
Furthermore, the West power calc has crashed 3 out of 5 nights weekly for the 
last 3 weeks.  This is not acceptable.
We are about to enter the busiest and most volatile time of the year and our 
system is not stable.  I feel like we have been very patient at the expense 
of many late nights.  I am going to speak to Kevin Presto and Tim Belden 
today about these problems. 
I think we need to meet immediately about this problem and I am exhausted 
with the finger pointing between different IT groups.
Thanks.

John,

Just to keep you in the loop.  I've been asked to assist with this effort.  I 
am more than happy to do so.  I'm going to use consultants and charge it 
directly to Enron Canada.

Mark and Beth;

Further to our discussions, I have followed up with Beth to talk about 
resources to build the Enron Canada retail business.  She has suggested the 
we use Cap Gemini to help convert Daniel's systems for the Canadian 
business.  I have also given Beth a name of a systems guy that came 
recommended that would be an employee here to help translate the differences 
in the markets and would ultimately be the Dan Maitland of Canada to look 
after the product as we build the business.

I think that it would be very helpful to have Daniel involved in the scoping 
due to his familiarity with the systems and the settlement requirements with 
the wires and pipes companies.  If Daniel could direct the development out of 
London, that would be great as well.  I heard that he did a great job on the 
Spanish effort.

Dave Delainey and John Lavorato are supportive of building this business here 
and the Canadian president(Rob Milnthorp) is also keen to grow this 
business.  I think that we can be much more effective using the UK systems 
than trying to build our own from scratch.  I would rather build this without 
looking to the EES IT resources out of Houston, as I believe that we will be 
more successful importing the latest ED systems and modifying them for this 
market in time for market opening--just 2 months away.

I really appreciate your help on this, and hope that we can work together to 
deliver another success to Enron as a whole.  I'm sure glad that I know you 
guys as I know that I will end up with a product that works for us.  Don't 
worry, I will not try any coding myself.

Best regards to you both, and I hope you are staying DRY in wet old London 
Mark.

Cheers,

Dave

John,

This is a resume I received today from  my friend.
Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to
me:


Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

I wanted to thank you guys for all your support over the last painful week.  
Although I am definately not getting brave, I would like to request an extra 
15 Million for gas for the next week.  The price levels are making it hard to 
eliminate risk.  I can give you my assurance that any increase in VAR day to 
day will come from price movement, not increase in position.  

Let me know 

John

Ignore expenses.  We just split the whole office in half to split the trading

John,
I left a copy of Nelson Ferries contract with Kim Hillis.  Nelson signed this 
draft and returned it to me today.  Please advise on how you would like me to 
proceed with this contract.

John, Jeanie Slone and I met with Nelson on Friday to discuss the contract, 
and I think that Nelson was seriously considering not signing it.  He told me 
that he would get a response to me on Monday(Fred L had given him a deadline 
of last Friday).  I do not have an email from Nelson or JEanie today so he 
may not have gotten back to anyone.  Jeanie, could you get a copy of Nelson's 
contract from Michelle or Twanda and drop it off with John?  Could you also 
touch base with Fred Lagrasta and see if Nelson has made a decision?  Thanks.

Subject: Price Caps

The following summarizes recent price cap events in California.  I think that 
I have most of it right.  If there is anything wrong or missing please let me 
know.  Please don't share the attached spreadsheet with anyone outside of 
Enron.

Regards,
Tim

New Cap Specifics
On 10/26/2000 the ISO Board passed a motion by a vote of 13-10 to implement a 
new price cap methodology.
The new methodology will become effective 11/3/2000 or as soon thereafter as 
can be implemented.  CAISO staff has indicated that it will be difficult to 
achieve that start date.  They have not yet indicated what an achievable date 
might be.
The new price cap methodology will remain in place until:
Comprehensive market changes have been implemented and the market has proven 
to be workably competitive under a variety of load conditions.
Either FERC or the ISO board orders its removal.
Cap prices will be based on the average NYMEX L3D settlement average and the 
following heat rate table:
  Load Level  Heat Rate  4.00 Gas Example Cap
  <25 GW   10,775   $43.10
  25 GW to 30 GW 14,175   $56.70
  30GW to 35 GW  17,225   $68.90
  35GW to 40 GW  27,225   $108.90
  >40 GW   $250/MWh  $250/MWh
Caps will be rounded up to the nearest $5/MWh increment.
Demand bids and demand responsiveness programs are exempt from these caps.
The ISO will post the price caps for each load level at least 48 hours prior 
to the beginning of each calendar month.  Based on the ISO's two day-ahead 
system load forecast, the ISO will post hourly caps at least 24 hours prior 
to the hour of delivery.

FERC Context
FERC has delegated cap authority to the CAISO until 11/15/2000.
The ISO has asserted that they don't need FERC authority since it is a bid 
cap rather than a sales cap.  FERC regulates sales, not purchases, of 
electricity and therefore can regulate sales prices but not purchase prices.
The ISO has filed with FERC for an extension of the price cap authority.  
FERC has to rule on the filing by 11/18/2000.  (Note that this is 3 days 
after their authority expires)
FERC will release its proposed order on 11/1/2000 based on the results of its 
206 investigation of the California wholesale power markets.  We don't know 
what they will find or what they will propose.
The proposed order will have a 30 day comment period, after which FERC will 
likely issue a final order.  FERC will be accepting oral comments on 
11/9/2000 in Washington.  Enron still has to determine who will provide oral 
comments.
Many companies have filed at FERC advocating or opposing a litany of price 
caps, cost based rates, and market redesign recommendations.
It is likely that the price caps approved by the ISO board will go into 
effect.  How long they will remain in effect will depend on whether FERC 
extends the ISO price cap authority and whether the final order stemming from 
the current 206 investigation stipulates a specific price cap policy.

Impact of Price Caps
The attached spreadsheet contains a table of likely maximum monthly prices at 
different gas price levels.  We think that this is the highest that markets 
would clear since it assumes that each hour clears at the cap.  It is hard to 
say whether actual prices would clear significantly lower than the cap 
because we don't know whether sellers will offer below the cap or at the 
cap.  The assumptions behind our analysis are detailed in the bullets below.
Take actual historical loads from 1999 and 2000.   
Calculate implied price cap for each hour using actual historical load, new 
price cap methodology, and a range of gas prices.
Divide historical hours into peak and off-peak buckets.
Calculate average price for each month for peak hours and off-peak hours.  
For example, we have two years worth of data for the months of January 
through September.  Each month has approximately 400 hours.  for January 
through September, we took approximately 800 observations for each month (400 
from each year) and calculated a simple average of all of the individual 
observations.
We created a peak table and an off-peak table.  The table shows the 
calculated implied cap based off of the acutal loads at varying gas prices 
for each month.  This value represents what the month would clear at if each 
hour cleared at the cap (based on historic loads).  While any given hour 
could be above this value, our calculation estimates the likely monthly 
average cap value!
The blue shading indicates what the caps would be given current (10/27/2000 
NYMEX) forward prices.  The yellow shading indicates those forward power 
prices which are in excess of the proposed cap.

John,

In general, results are not too different from last day roll.    For "no 
roll" and "roll same position" strategies, the 2nd last day seems to 
outperform slightly more often.

Let me know if you would like to 
1) look at quarter to quarter earning volatility of these strategies or
2) look at effect of incorporating some transaction costs for 
rolling/liquidating positions.

I thought I would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list 
of agreed apon tasks.

1.  The Unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we 
have huge business risk if it blows up. 

 -->  Sally and Beth are going to document the steps we are taking to 
maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.  
        (everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds 
like it should be a high priority)

2.  The database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to 
long hours on the part of our back office staff.  

 -->  Beth is moving from Sun-O-S to Sun-Sularis which should allow us to 
address the problem.  We have 4 contractors working on this and we are 
expecting it to take 6 weeks.  Once this project is complete we can add 
hardware and reduce the time problems.

3.   The traders need better real time management tools that ultimately 
combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real 
time risk.
TDS was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the 
traders needs.  This ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by 
the               traders to meet their needs. 

 -->  Phillip Allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in 
consultation with all the gas desks heads.   After this Beth should try to 
come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.

4.  The power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.  This is 
leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.  Beth has made 
progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the 
next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.

5.  Steve Natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with Kevin 
Presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements 
deals and volume management deals in the east.

6.  There will be no more business trips to London (somewhat kidding).

7.  Portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their 
books through an interface with Houston.  

 -->  John Lavorato will talk to Tim Beldon and Beth to determine whether its 
worthwile to put servers in Portland.    

 -->  Since Tim was not in the meeting, John will make sure we are covering 
all his needs.

All of a sudden Mark Frevert asks me everyday about when we'll know about 
hedging re PPA's and if we can delay the auction 2 weeks.

The dream is still alive.  

Let's see my boys come through.

John:

I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the 
compensation proposal I sent last week. Before our conversation this morning 
I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might 
help keep our discussion more focused. 

First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and 
probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron. 
In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information 
by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, 
compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all 
have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research 
and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In 
several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of 
the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack 
of communication of any "overall compensation plan" which drives people to 
the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to 
do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked 
with none has ever explained any such "plan". Tim has indicated that there is 
some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey 
are trying to adhere to. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it 
may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a 
contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the 
contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is 
forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle). 

Second, Tim indicated some concern about locking in certain minimum overall 
compensation levels and that "if a person were to have a bad year there may 
be no room for bonus". I think this is a real concern particularly when we 
consider a new trader from outside the company. In my case, while I currently 
don't have a specific book that gets marked each day, I think there is a 
clear record over the past seven years of significant value to ENA's west 
power business. This value comes in several forms: value above the 
offer/below the bid, market information driving both short and long-term 
value into our books, developing new markets and products for ENA, extending 
my market knowledge and deal structuring capabilities on a continuous basis 
each day to other origination/strucuturing/mid-market/real time groups, 
building a no-risk/high value Services business, and providing leadership to 
employees about their role at Enron or Enron's role in the market. All of 
these efforts are focused on adding mark-to-market value to ENA in more ways 
than any single, specific book can measure. I am certain that I will continue 
to add value in these ways and have little concern about this "bad year" 
scenario.

Finally, I am trying to make sense of the proposed compensation that Tim has 
relayed to me. If I understand it correctly my cash compensation pay would 
change from $206k ($130 base /$56 COLA /$50 retention) over the past three 
years as a Director to a base pay of $170k as a Vice President with higher 
expections and increasing responsibilities. The equity plan that is currently 
available to Vice Presidents and above would be locked in at values of 
$175/$125. This one is a little hard for me to evaluate as it is new in its 
current form (I have been a participant in prior years of similar equity 
plans which have ranged in initial from $10k-$50k as a Director). Bonus would 
be determined annually, I assume under similar process as past years. The 
trouble I am having is evaluating a significant decrease in cash compensation 
after being promoted and locking in a known (versus unknown) value in an 
equity plan for which I presumably am already a participant in and for which 
there is little other plan information available to evaluate.  I would 
appreciate your thoughts on this in relation to any overall compensation 
"plan".

I'll look forward to our discussion.

Greg

John,

Happy New Year!!  I wish you and your family the best and as Dina puts
it...BUY LOW, SELL HIGH (lol).

I have a great deal of songs to send you.  Just look at the lists (you can
open it with Wordpad) and let me know wich ones you like or if you prefer I
will send them all to you.  Also, I wont be able to send them via e-mail
(too big in memory size).  Therefore, check to see if your IT group have an
IOmega Zip Drive (100 MB) so that I can mail the songs to you.

I have attached the copy of the mi2 theme song and a catalog of the
Corvette.

My opinion is that you need a budget.

Can you tell me how many Enron entities are members of the AGA (American Gas 
Association).  The fee is 100K and I think HPL is a member and not us.  But I 
wonder if some of our other piplelines are members.

I would like to request an extension of the 45 million limit until Friday.  
We like gas and we would like to maximize this move.

FYI.  Hebert is a strong opponent of price caps but not sure how hard he is 
willing to push on RTO formation and additional transmission open access.

Bush Nominates Hebert for Energy 
( January 22, 2001 ) 


WASHINGTON, Jan 22, 2001 (AP Online via COMTEX) -- President Bush named Curt 
Hebert, who has argued against federal involvement in the California 
electricity crisis, as chairman of the agency that regulates wholesale power 
markets. 

      White House spokesman Ari Fleischer announced the selection as senior 
administration officials, including Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, met at 
the White House to discuss the California power situation. 

      Hebert, the former state utility regulator in Mississippi, is the only 
Republican on the current five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
which he will head. Bush shortly is expected to name two new members. 

      Despite California's problems, Hebert gave a strong endorsement Monday 
of electricity deregulation and letting market forces determine prices and 
electricity supplies. 

      As FERC chairman, he said in a statement, "I will do my utmost to see 
that competition is encouraged, that it is fair, that consumers have a 
genuine choice, and that the public interest is safeguarded." 

      Total competition in the electricity industry "is part of the solution 
rather than part of the problem" now faced in California, he said. Retail 
prices there in many cases remain regulated. 

      A close friend of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Hebert 
has argued forcefully in recent weeks against FERC imposing price controls on 
wholesale electricity sales into California. 

      When FERC in mid-December took modest steps to help California cope 
with its surging electricity prices, Hebert agreed with the measures, but 
said he would rather have favored eliminating all price controls. 

      In an interview last week, Bush also expressed his opposition to 
imposing price controls - in the form of FERC-mandated price caps on 
wholesale power - on the California market, saying they would be 
counterproductive. 

      California Gov. Gray Davis and the state's cash-strapped utilities have 
urged FERC to intervene in the wholesale market, arguing that power 
generating companies were price gouging. FERC has so far rejected the plea. 

      Hebert was described by power industry officials as a free-market 
advocate when it comes to the electricity industry and has favored leaving 
decisions on electricity deregulation to states instead of the federal 
government. 

      Hebert replaces William Massey, a Democrat, who was elevated to the 
chairmanship by President Clinton on Jan. 19, after James Hoecker, another 
Clinton appointee, unexpectedly resigned. 

      Hebert, 38, a former Mississippi state legislator and member of the 
state Public Service Commission, joined FERC in November, 1997. His current 
term expires in 2004. 

      He comes from Pascagoula, Miss., as does Lott. 

      With Hoecker's resignation there remain two vacancies on the 
commission, which has been at the center of both the natural gas and 
electricity industry's shift to deregulation in recent years. 

      It was FERC that issued rules that opened the nation's electric power 
grid to competition in the mid-1990s, prompting many states - led by efforts 
in California - to embrace electricity industry deregulation amid promises it 
would lead to lower consumer prices because of competition. In most cases, 
deregulation has not led to substantial savings for consumers. 

      In California, where the effort has been acknowledged as a failure, 
power prices have soared amid shortages that have produced rolling blackouts 
in recent days and threatened two of the state's major investor-owned 
utilities with bankruptcy.

John -

Again,  we are having "big time" systems issues.  While we are having the 
usual length of time issues (a few people were here past midnight last 
night), the issues that occured last night are much more serious than in the 
past.  The system brought through totally inaccurate information on a few 
books.  (Positions,  value,  etc.)  Luckily, these errors were all caught 
last night,  but if a less experienced person had been on those books,  it 
could have been a disaster.  (Traders getting incorrect positions and p&l and 
interest rate and credit getting incorrect numbers.)  I have contacted those 
in ERMS that need to be involved,  but I would appreciate it if you could 
provide additional support to this effort.

Thanks,

Jeff

Here is the revised draft of the document outlining the issues to be covered 
in order to provide a picture of how Ontario's market might operate from a 
pricing perspective - who can/will influence it, and how.

John, this is what I extrapolated from Jim Fallon's comments - if you think 
some of it is "irrelevent" please let Jan and I know this weekend so that we 
don't waste time.  Thanks.

We will wear the ICAP position with the following marks that represent the 
true mid.

 2001 2.00 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2002 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)
 2003 1.65 (0.35 lower than yesterday)

These new marks result in $9 million of incremental value that will hit 
Dana's P&L tonight.   Based on our discussion earlier, East Power (Dana 
specifically) is now fully wearing this position and fully assumes all 
downside and upside associated with the position.
