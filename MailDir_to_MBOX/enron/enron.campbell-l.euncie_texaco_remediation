Two points were apparent after my last conversation with Bill Olson about a 
month ago:

1) Texaco has convinced Bill that the plume of elevated TDS originates from 
an offsite source; an old waterflood operation toward the northwest and 
upgradient of the Texaco and NNG facilities. Although our data from 2-3 years 
ago indicated the source as Texaco's old brine ponds, Bill indicated that 
Texaco has more recently presented data that is more regional in scope and 
implicates the waterflood operation. I have not seen any of this recent data.

2) Bill has accepted Texaco's single soil boring in the former crude oil pit 
area as evidence that the pit was not the source of oil found in NNG's 
monitor well MW-3. I don't agree, but our best chance of convincing him 
otherwise will not come until Texaco excavates the old pit area and completes 
the additional assessment activities we agreed to in our meeting with them 
last year.

In light of these two points, I think it is going to be difficult to convince 
Bill that NNG should not adhere to the biennial sampling until things are 
settled between Texaco and NNG. However, if you are going to give it a shot, 
I suggest that you present the position that:
1) Texaco has already demonstrated (whether correctly or not) that the 
dissolved phase plume of TDS originated from another source;
2) Texaco has already demonstrated that they were the source for the 
dissolved phase plume of benzene measured in NNG's fenceline monitor wells; 
and,
3) The only unresolved issue is the presence of PSH in monitor well MW-3.
In light of this, the only monitoring NNG should be responsible for is 
measuring PSH thickness in well MW-3 since it makes no sense to collect 
groundwater samples from a well containing free product. 

Also, the last information I have on Texaco's activities is an assessment 
report dated July 1997. If you would get a copy of any more recent reports 
and correspondence it would be a big help. 

Another thought to consider, prior sampling history indicated a declining 
trend of benzene concentrations at NNG's fenceline monitor wells. If this 
trend has continued, additional sample data would be beneficial to our future 
discussions with Texaco and the OCD.

Bret, what do you think about this?  We have pretty much proven that we are 
not the culprits is this activity.  I have a problem conducting an ongoing 
sampling for an issue that were not responsible for, even though we initiated 
the sampling activity.  I plan on visiting the OCD about this issue and 
either forcing them to justify why we should continue the sampling when the 
data points to our neighbors.  Additionally, because of the turnover and 
inability to get the guilty party to get moving on this, spending additional 
money and not receiving any return seems like a waste of time.  Thoughts....

The last groundwater sampling event at the Eunice Station was completed in 
August 1997. Subsequently, the OCD approved our revised sampling plan that 
calls for biennial sampling. In light of this we were due to sample this past 
August. I held off on sampling in hope that Texaco would soon assume this 
responsibility, however, since it does not appear that this is going to occur 
anytime soon enough I will schedule a sampling event within the next four 
weeks. Since there are only six monitor wells to sample at this site, 
sampling can be completed in one day by one person at a cost of about $2500 
(including expenses and lab costs).

Bret: I discussed this with Bill Kendrick this afternoon, our suggestion is 
that you forward my original message on the subject to Texaco's attorney 
asking several questions: 1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal 
activities; 2) has the release been stopped and how; 3) has the extent of 
impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto NNG's property or down 
to groundwater; and 4) has the NMOCD been notified. We should also indicate 
our concern that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through NNG's 
facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, particularly 
the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG facility near 
the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains PSH). This will 
allow Texaco the opportunity to notify the OCD. 

In a related matter, I think a copy of the letter that I prepared for Larry 
regarding excavation activities should be transmitted to Texaco's attorney 
and the OCD. I suggest sending a copy of this letter to the OCD because Bill 
Olson with the OCD had asked for a copy of any correspondence that was 
generated regarding the excavation activities and because Texaco has already 
indicated that their lab results did not identify the presence of impacted 
soil remaining in the excavation area.

This is to let you know where we are on your proposed settlement agreement.
TEPI's SH&E staff advises me that  the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division
("OCD") has required revisions to TEPI's remediation plan for this site.  We
are reluctant to submit to you a revised draft of the settlement agreement
until that remediation plan is finalized with the OCD in about October. At
that time we will get Enron a redraft.

I have reviewed your last draft and have a few conceptual items I would like
to mention to you , bearing in mind that I have not participated in earlier
discussions or drafts:

(1) I notice that the proposed agreement requires TEPI to remediate the site
and to reimburse Northern for all out of pocket expenses for investigation,
assessment ,remediation and monitoring  this site, if TEPI is the source of
contamination--- but that Northern is only required to reimburse TEPI for
its part of the environmental assessment if Northern is found to be the
source. I would think that these provisions should be bilateral and that the
settlement agreement should also provide that if Northern is at fault, it
would remediate the site, as well as reimburse TEPI for all of the same out
of pocket  expenses.

(2) How does Enron/Northern feel about submitting this dispute to binding
AAA arbitration in Houston,  if the parties cannot agree on the source of
the contamination after TEPI conducts the environmental assessment, with the
arbitrators empowered to allocate costs if they determine that both parties
contributed to the contamination?  If arbitration is agreeable, I will
prepare an arbitration provision for our next draft.

(3) I am inclined to have the agreement interpreted under Texas law, rather
than New Mexico's,  since both companies have large presences in Texas , but
do not feel strongly about it.

Let me know your thoughts on these matters when you have a chance.

George, after Bret's memo, go ahead and conduct the sampling.  the soonest I 
can discuss the issue with the OCD is in the middle of November.  I have 
reviewed the reports and results of the studies conducted by us and them and 
the evidence weighs in our favor.  At your leisure and prior to the November  
OCD meeting,  prepare a memo to file of the resaons and justification based 
upon the report results and data why Eunice is not the bad guy in this and 
why Texaco is.  Gradients,  plume elevations and characteristics of the 
contaminants show that this is not our problem.  Id like to have sufficient 
evidence, both mine and yours, to force OCD to go afterTexaco and  get us out 
of this issue.  

I think this would also help Bret's case for having Texaco (or whoever is 
responsible)  reimburse Northern  for the costs we have incurred for what is 
Texaco's problem.

Thanx

George,  The Eunice Team has been activitly involved in the well testing for 
ground water contamination for quite    sometime now and know of some of the 
controversy regarding the Eunice Compressor Station.

  Recently Dynegy has undertaking a project to remove a 10" low pressure sour 
gas pipeline in the     Southwest area of our station outside of our fence 
line.  There are two monitoring wells in this location and    the presence 
of  contamination seems to be increasing in this area.  We took some 
pictures  of this area 
  while Dynegy was in the process of removing their pipe.  There appears to 
be quite abit of contamination    and seemed be generated by the condition of 
the pipe as you will see in the pictures.

  If you have any questions please give us a call.

  Thanks
  Ray Noseff

Today I received the information relayed below regarding activities at the 
Eunice facility.  Judging from the pictures and the description of the work, 
there are compelling indications that former operations at the Eunice 
facility impacted the property owned by Northern Natural Gas.  Please respond 
to the following questions at your earliest convenience:

1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal activities; 
2) has the release been stopped and how; 
3) has the extent of impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto 
NNG's property or down to groundwater; and 
4) has the NMOCD been notified. 

I am also concerned that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through 
NNG's facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, 
particularly the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG 
facility near the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains 
PSH).  Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.  I suggest we get 
together sometime in the near future to discuss this recent information.

Subject: NNG Eunice Station - Recent Development

Last week I received a message from the Eunice Team that Dynegy, the current 
owner of the adjacent Texaco Plant, had recently undertaken a project to 
remove a large diameter low pressure sour gas pipeline located just west of 
the NNG facility. The Team took photos of the removed section of pipe and the 
excavated soil. The removed pipe has at least two repair patches and there 
was considerable hydrocarbon stained soil removed from the pipe trench. Four 
of the Team's photos are attached with this message. Also attached is an 
updated diagram indicating the location of the removed section of pipe. The 
diagram is saved in a Microsoft HTML format that may require Microsoft 
Explorer to view. If you have trouble opening the file, refer to the diagram 
recently generated for the letter regarding the excavation activities. The 
location of the removed section runs from the western edge of the pit 
excavation area towards the north-northwest. This places the removed line 
within approximately 50 feet of our monitor well MW-3 (the well which has PSH 
above the water table).

We received preliminary sample results yesterday. Sample #1 (TPH = 97 mg/kg) 
and Sample #2 (TPH = 121 mg/kg) were collected from the east wall of the 
excavation about 2 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about 4 feet below 
ground surface. Sample #3 (TPH = 22400 mg/kg) was collected from the east 
wall of the excavation about 8 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about 
8-10 feet below ground surface. There was little visual evidence that this 
soil sample was affected, but apparently it is. 

In my discussions with Texaco's consultant, I inquired about their sample 
analysis plan. He indicated that they were submitting soil samples for TPH 
analysis by method 8015mod (GRO & DRO). I was concerned about comparing 
results from the 8015mod analysis to our older data generated by method 
418.1. In light of this I submitted our samples for analysis by method 418.1. 
The 8015mod method is a more compound specific analysis than the 418.1 method 
and often the more appropriate method to use. However, in this case it may 
not be the most appropriate method. The 8015mod method is a GC method used to 
measure the mass of hydrocarbon compounds that will elute within specific 
time windows. The first time window is set up to measure the mass of gasoline 
range organics (GRO). The second time window is set up to measure the mass of 
diesel range organics (DRO). Any hydrocarbon compounds that elute after the 
DRO time window are not measured. This would not be an issue if the soil was 
contaminated with a light condensate, but Texaco's oil pit was reportedly 
used to accumulate liquids not suitable for feed stock to the plant. I think 
we can assume this meant heavy hydrocarbons. The 418.1 method is a less 
sophisticated method that measures petroleum hydrocarbon compounds over a 
wider range of carbon number, that is, it will measure the presence of 
heavier hydrocarbons that would not be measured using method 8015mod. In 
light of this, the 418.1 method is likely the more appropriate method for 
assessing soil affected by the Texaco oil pit, particularly when results are 
compared to older data generated using method 418.1.

I have requested our lab to confirm the results for Sample #3 using method 
418.1. In addition, I have asked that they run the sample using method 
8015mod (GRO & DRO) so that we can compare the two results. We should have 
these results later next week. I would like to get this additional 
information and discuss it among ourselves before we respond to Texaco. Right 
now I am inclined to say that the Texaco oil pit is neither implicated or 
cleared as the culprit of contamination found in NNG's monitor well MW-3.

compressor site. Once you have had a chance to talk to your clients,  and
the Enron consultants who witnessed the work, give me a call and lets
discuss the next step.  I am not sure the settlement agreements we drafted
are still relevant.

As you can see , I am now in our Houston office. You can now contact me at
the numbers shown below. The email address is unchanged. I will be in the
office through Thursday, and out of town the following week.

Let me know when you are ready to discuss this.
