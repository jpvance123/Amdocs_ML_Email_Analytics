Hi Dutch,
 
I hated to call you to tell you I still don't have an answer from EDF Man.  I spoke to Paul again about 5 min. ago (1:45) and he tells me that he still can't get an answer but that I'm the first on the list to call!!??  I then called our treasury department and spoke to Nera and she says that the wire has not come in as of yet.
 
I'll let you know as soon as I do!

Hi Greg and Georganne,
 
Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

One of the reasons I asked about traders' reluctance to deal with Enron is the article below questions our ability to deliver on winter gas.  I would like to prepare an answer in case anyone asks.  


POWER POINTS: Time For A Bronx Miracle In Houston
By Mark Golden

11/02/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down by two runs with one man on, Enron Corp. (ENE) needs nothing less than a home run just to stay in the game.
This is the home run Enron must come up with: Full disclosure of the assets and liabilities of those troubled partnerships that have been kept off their balance sheet, and proof the corporation can cover the difference. It's what stockholders, bondholders and trading partners have been demanding, but time is running out, and Enron hasn't produced. 
"We're going to get to that number soon and tell people. We have to do that," said a source at Enron, who didn't know how quickly the disclosure would come or whether it would be independently audited. "In this environment, we are going to be absolutely sure that it's accurate." 
Enron has about $3.3 billion in debt on the two key partnerships payable in 2003. The company will sell the assets in those partnerships and, in a worse case scenario, will face a $1 billion shortfall that could be covered by selling stock and other company assets, Enron has said. The company hopes that when the time comes to issue new stock, shares will be trading closer to $20 than their current $11. 
Investors, however, aren't acting as if they're reassured. Part of the trouble, analysts with credit-rating firm Standard & Poor's said Friday morning, is that until Enron sells the assets, nobody knows for sure what they're worth or how deep the partnerships are in the hole. 
S&P is confident that Enron can raise enough capital to fill that hole, provided its trading partners in key energy markets continue to business with the company. 
Credit Derivative Fizzle 

To see the pickle the world's premier energy franchise is in, one needs to look no further than its credit derivatives trading desk. That relatively new and innovative operation was getting off the ground nicely, but the desk hasn't been able to transact for three weeks, since the value of Enron's stock and bonds began to plummet, according to another Enron employee. 
Enron didn't respond to a request for comment, but the Enron Credit division in Europe said in a release that lines are "constrained" as the market continues to evaluate the company's credit position. 
Until recently, customers would buy a credit derivative from Enron to cover its exposure to bankruptcy by a third company. A big supplier to a financially troubled company like Xerox Corp. (XRX) or Lucent Technologies (LU), for example, might pay Enron $1 million a year for a payout of, say, $10 million in the event of a bankruptcy. 
But you wouldn't pay the premium on your insurance unless you were sure that the insurance company could pay your claims. Likewise, with Enron's creditworthiness in doubt, there's no reason to pay a lot of money just to exchange Lucent risk for Enron risk. 
The same holds true, though less obviously, for Enron's core business of energy trading. Some utilities, large industrial companies and other energy trading companies could see their profits ruined if natural gas prices - already on the rise at $3 per million British thermal units - shoot to $10 this winter as they did last winter. 
To guard against that risk, companies buy contracts now for delivery this winter at set prices. If a company wants to lock in winter gas at $3, should it turn to Enron? If gas were to rise to $10 in January and Enron couldn't deliver, Enron's counterparty paid a good price for no protection. And if Enron failed in a $10 gas market, that would send hundreds of companies scrambling for supplies. Gas could go to $20 in a heartbeat. 
Leading Role An Asset 

Enron does have a man on base. The company is so important to energy market participants that they desperately want Enron to survive. And any company that moves to lock Enron out of the market now could regret doing so if Enron survives as the big dog. 
Enron's trading partners have a pretty consistent position at this point: They are continuing to trade with Enron, but are avoiding long-term deals that increase their exposure to the company. The only acceptable long-term deals are those that offset deals done earlier. Unless and until a bill goes unpaid, they'll keep delivering. 
Enron, like the rest of the U.S. energy industry, paid its bills for September gas deliveries on Oct. 20 and for its September electricity deliveries on Oct. 25. Its next power and gas bills come due in the third week of November. 
That means trading companies generally have just seven weeks of receivables at risk before Enron's creditworthiness faces another test. In exchange for taking on that small risk, they keep the great market maker in business. 
Lenders Show Concerns 

Lenders, whether through holding Enron bonds or providing loans, don't have the same luxury as energy trading companies that are keeping deals on a short leash. Lenders supply cash up front and for longer periods of time, usually years. 
Outside of long-term commitments, what worries the banks, which presumably got a good look at Enron's books? If Enron is now unable to make the big bets with long-term energy deals that have kept it profitable for years, can it service all of its liabilities, known and unknown? If it has to sell profitable assets like pipelines and power plants, or otherwise put those assets at risk, will lower earnings be enough to pay rising credit costs? What happens if its greatest asset - its traders - leave in droves to work elsewhere? 
If Enron is to have a chance, it needs energy trading profits to keep rolling in so that it can continue to service its debt. So far this year, trading and other wholesale operations have accounted for $2.2 billion out of $2.4 billion in net recurring income before interest and taxes. By comparison, Enron has made $617 million in interest payments so far this year. 
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. (C) unit Salomon Smith Barney, at least, don't show much confidence Enron can do it. When they agreed to provide Enron with a $1 billion line of credit, they did so only after Enron posted valuable gas pipelines as collateral. 
Bond traders - the most sophisticated investors in the world - make their money by understanding the probabilities. They're trading Enron debt at levels typically associated with distressed companies. 
The lenders have chalked up their runs. Shareholders have ratcheted up the pressure. 
Enron, now, must step up to the plate.

Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book an=
d may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could giv=
e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah=09


On Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =
NY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=
 million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=
lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=
e bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=
ollowing events according to Steve:

Thursday 10/25
ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=
sting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=
s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=
sociated with the moving of the trades.=20
Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=
 agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =
them at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=
ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=
 on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =
price, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=
 on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=
ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=
10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20

Friday, 10/26
On Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =
Fimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =
send the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=
 behalf of Enron. =20
On Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =
million by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=
en margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=
t wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=
=20
On Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=
imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=
r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=
e undisclosed. =20
Very late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=
ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20
Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=
ight now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20
Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=
ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=
 with these events. =20

Monday, 10/29
Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =
the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=
red to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =
it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=
ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =
in the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=
 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=
ement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=
e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=
scomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20

Tuesday, 10/30
100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.

Fimat proposed solutions
$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf
Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=
dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)
ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=
ts on ENE's behalf

My tkae on the situation:
Fimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =
press.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=
at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=
argin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=
 the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=
 responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=
ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=
e payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=
en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=
ne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=
ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=
ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=
tice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=
 we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =
an on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=
 but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=

Subject: Hello!



It's Friday, and I'm here settling Nymex.  I got a phone call from Evelyn Wednesday before Thanksgiving to come in today.  It's o.k.  I don't mind.  I get Monday off.  Just a few notes to let you know what's going on.  EDF Mann, Paribas and Carr Futures London pulled a fast one.  They set the margin at 150% more of what it would have been.  Here are the numbers incoming and outgoing.

        OUTGOING                

                Smith Barney Financial                  $232,499.00 
                Paribas                                 $46,026,588.00 
                EDF Mann                                $760,515.00 
                Carr Futures                            $12,331,010.66 

        INCOMING 

                ABN Amro                                $33,852.00 
                Saul Stone                              $19,800.00 
                HSBC                                    $291,325.00 
                HSBC Canada                             No Margin Call 
                R. J. Obrien                            $12,320.00 
                J.P. Morgan                             $292,827.00 
                Credit Suisse                           $200,261.00 
                

Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday, so we did not settle.  

FIMAT was not in, and the numbers came out like this.  They were supposed to have paid down on the loan by $2,931,087.24.  I don't know how you handle this.  Hopefully they will do this on Monday.

I know this is a terrible welcome back, but it was something that had to be done.

ENE is in a severe liquidity crisis.  Even if EDF makes mistakes we have to be careful how we treat them because Enron's cash position is very precarious.  It's good to insist that EDF give us what's owed especially since they seem to be wrong in this case but as far as lines of credit go, ENE is in a much worse position than ever before.  

I am going to get a guarantee to Fimat today from Enron Corp with respect to ENA trades.  We have never had to do this before but if I do not get it Fimat will keep their trade line at $11 million.  Soc Gen (extends credit under Fimat line) is being a big pain but having spoken to our bank people we have no choice but to be grateful we are getting credit these days.  

Please keep this bad cash/credit situation confidential.

Hi Dutch,
 
Yes, I would think this is possible because the overall margin excess is $24,296,123.00.  Unfortunately, I don't see any "breakdowns" on the numbers.
 
Hope this helps!

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.

Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?  
 
I thank you for your help in this matter.

Hi again!
 
I'm pretty sure that the commissions are included on statements and charge to us daily.  Therefore, the numbers that we are confirming as either excess or margin call, is inclusive of the fees.  I believe Jason Fisher would have the exact amount of the fees.  I know this question has been proposed several times and I've always refered them directly to Jason, and I'm assuming that he was able to help as I never heard back from anyone.
 
I hope I'm leading you in the correct direction.  If not, please let me know so that I too may be aware.
 
Thanks!

Dutch - please double check the below information and comment on it.  


According to Man, Man expected these positions to be xpitted per their conversations with Dutch and John on 10/31/2001.  They were not xpitted.  If these were supposed to be xpitted and we did not do it, please sign off on it so Jason and Errol can implement it early on Friday 11/2.  
Please call me if there is any confusion so that we can put this issue to rest as early as possible.

Hi Everyone,
 
Just an FYI....I will be out the office next week starting November 19th and returning on the 26th.  Cynthia Shoup will be handling Nymex Settlement in my absense and she can be reached at ext. 3-7328.
 
As some of you are aware, I normally have to settle margins the day after Thanksgiving as it an Enron holiday, not a bank holiday.  I have pleaded with all my brokers and they agreed to push settlement to the 26th upon my return.  If any of you should anticipate any problems with this, please let me know.
 
The very happiest of Thanksgiving to all!
 
Thanks!

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

Per our statement from EDF Man today, it appears that we have excess on our account of $9,535,870.00.  Upon speaking to Paul at EDF Man, he told me that no money would be transfered.  He said that someone in their office was speaking to Marty Timmins in our office..???  Have either of you heard anything regarding the wire for today?

EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.

Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book an=
d may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could giv=
e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah=09


On Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =
NY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=
 million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=
lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=
e bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=
ollowing events according to Steve:

Thursday 10/25
ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=
sting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=
s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=
sociated with the moving of the trades.=20
Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=
 agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =
them at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=
ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=
 on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =
price, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=
 on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=
ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=
10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20

Friday, 10/26
On Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =
Fimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =
send the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=
 behalf of Enron. =20
On Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =
million by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=
en margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=
t wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=
=20
On Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=
imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=
r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=
e undisclosed. =20
Very late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=
ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20
Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=
ight now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20
Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=
ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=
 with these events. =20

Monday, 10/29
Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =
the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=
red to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =
it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=
ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =
in the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=
 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=
ement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=
e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=
scomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20

Tuesday, 10/30
100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.

Fimat proposed solutions
$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf
Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=
dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)
ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=
ts on ENE's behalf

My tkae on the situation:
Fimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =
press.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=
at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=
argin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=
 the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=
 responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=
ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=
e payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=
en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=
ne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=
ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=
ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=
tice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=
 we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =
an on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=
 but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=
rly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20

We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=
o entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=
r brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=
t now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=
 we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=
y.  Let's decide what to do and implement.

Notice No. 01-372
November 2, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		EXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP
TRANSACTIONS

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would lower
the cost of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions to $2.50 per
contract per side from $10 per contract per side and would apply the
discounted fee retroactively to the natural gas transactions conducted since
the start of the program yesterday.

We are gratified that the strong response to the introduction of this
trading instrument will allow us to so heavily discount the transaction fee.

The Exchange introduced EFS transactions in its natural gas futures market
yesterday as the first step of its plans to offer clearing services to the
over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  In its first full day, there
were 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.

EFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)
transactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution
of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on
pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures
contract.

EFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures
market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The
clearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the
Exchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the
futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties
involved.

Year-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately
60,000 contracts.  Yesterday's volume, including the EFS transactions was
73,364 natural gas futures contracts.

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.
 
Thanks!
