We need to help the EGM London coal team to understand the implications of 
Loyola's pronouncement and the draft legislat. which is promised. You are 
both already in touch with the EIM London steel team to explore implications 
of ECSC termination, US steel anti-dumping measures, the Arbed/ Usinor merger 
etc. Please contact Paul D to co-ordinate your briefing of the coal team. In 
both cases Lisa Yoho in Houston should be kept informed.

Lisa: Brendan and Nailia, working with me in the Brussels office, are also 
endeavouring to answer questions from the London freight team about EU 
freight market/ rail liberalisation. If you have suggestions for further 
co-ordination please let me know. You can call me on +32 2 535 7831 in 
Brussels or mobile no. +44 7768 233773.

EWI: Early Warning Information

DE PALACIO BACKS CONSTANT COAL PRODUCTION
European Energy and Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio has confirmed
her commitment to creating a basic level of fossil fuel production
(including coal) to help guarantee security of supplies in Europe. Mrs de
Palacio is current preparing a legislative proposal with a view planning
coal production after the ECSC Treaty expires, in July 2002. She said "coal
continues to be one of the main sources of energy and remains at the centre
of our concerns. As well as being one of the native resources coal also
contributes to regional cohesion.". Coal subsidies are due to be phased out
by 2010, when all countries are supposed achieve a drastic cut in their
greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Kyoto Protocol provisions. "
However, it is vital to have more than a strategic reserve, which mean a
proportion of the infrastructure, the professional skills and the techno
-logical experience," she stressed. In the coming weeks she plans to table a
proposal to create a basic level of subsidised primary energies, comprising
coal and renewable sources of energy: "the aim is to strengthen the security
of supply situation in Europe " she explained, adding that "its use has to
be in keeping with environmental protection considerations ". She
underscored the importance of research and technological development for
promo-ting less environmentally hostile production activities.

Thanks for copying me Paul. I fed some of my own comments on first draft 
direct to Littlechild when I saw him in our Amsterdam office last week. Are 
you satisfied that your points have now been adequately taken into account in 
second draft/ final?

As to your question, yes I think he really does believe what he writes; 
having met him twice now, I am quite impressed by his quick comprehension and 
his dedication to the cause of real competition in transparent markets. 

Sorry I've missed the "relations with TenneT" meeting today - have just come 
into Madrid office. 
Peter.

Subject: Re: FW: paper on info provision  

Have read paper.  Great start.  Would probably want to change some stuff, but 
given time constraint, probably good to raise the issue and fill in detail 
later.

My comments:

As you know, main argument from OMEL was that revealing info was a deterent 
to small players entering the market - because everyone would know what they 
are up to.  Perhaps good arguement is that it is a tradeoff - more info at 
start to address competition imbalances, then changing in future to reveal 
less about smaller players activities.........?  Maybe we should get Paul D 
to ask EIUG (Lisa Waters - demand side and smaller participants) in the UK 
for their view  of whether they thought more info was better or worse.......

Other OMEL argument was collusion.  If info is not available then it is 
illegal for large players to collect and use it and therefore collusion 
through the use of info becomes illegal.  However, when it is published, it 
is available, and therefore use of it was seen to be not illegal.      Don't 
agree with this logic.  It is the act of colluding that is wrong, not the 
means by which you do it.  Providing info allows more policing of bids etc 
and therefore increased likelihood of collusion being caught.  Maybe provide 
example of how academics etc used UK Pool info to catch NP/PG?  Also, it is 
not provision of info that leads to market power.  Market power is either 
there or it's not (Herfendale Index?) - its primarily a function of market 
share in certain times of day and in the different DA, Intraday, Real-Time  
markets.  More or less info will not address market power - divestiture 
does.  If the market believes market power is already present (Spain and 
Italy), they need the info to determine the extent to which this power can be 
exersized and which markets to stay clear of.  Finally, GREAT POINT IN LAST 
PARAGRAPH OF 'FACILITATING COLLUSION PARAGRAPH' - "COLLUSION IS UNNECESSARY 
FOR THE EXERSIZE OF MARKET POWER: IT CAN BE DONE INSIDE ONE COMPANY"  Love 
it......

Perhaps also introduce the info asymetries point.  Without publishing the 
DATA, the INFORMATION available to the market is tilted considerable in 
favour of those that can set price.

Need also to address TIMING of market data release.  Why sooner is better 
than later.  Have still not fully thought through the best way to argue 
this........ Possible answer may be that the market changes every day and for 
the market to become liquid, players need to be able to trade and adjust 
their position each week, day, hour - particularly the load side.  Can maybe 
use California here.  Need load side to be as responsive to prices as 
possible and understand what is driving them to allow demand to respond to 
price signals - something that did not happen in CA.  Also, market power can 
be used a lot in the short term.  It only takes a few hours of crazy prices 
for the monthly average to change considerably.  Possible example for timely 
release and short-term effects is the change to LOLP mechanism that 
Littlechild imposed - the 8-day average for XMAX (Capacity) when Gencos were 
gaming LOLP day to day (see Paul D)

Finally, does Littlechild really believe in this stuff?  That is important to 
know before we facilitate him being thrown into the debate as he needs to be 
able to roll through the punches.  If he is, and based on this first draft, 
he should be a very powerful ally.

Brendan & I have been in discussion over the last few days, as he was 
concerned that his personal circumstances would prevent him from travelling 
out of Brussels for the next 6 months or so (except very occasionally), and 
about how this would affect his ability to support the Continental Gas 
business as he was hired to do.  Options included :

 (1) Brendan going back to the Commission for a year or two and reapproaching 
Enron after that period and 
 (2) keeping him in Brussels for the interim period and redefining the role 
to focus less on gas and to pick up other EC related work on ecommerce, 
environment, coal, steel etc.

Where Brendan has been involved so far, he has shown valuable knowledge of 
and insight into the Commission's working practices.  Following discussion 
with Eric, our recommendation is to keep Brendan in a Brussels position in 
the interim, rather than risk the possibility that after 1 or 2 years he 
never actually appears.  He should be available to transfer to London on a 
temporary (and perhaps even permanent) basis in early 2002.  Under these 
circumstances, I believe it would make more sense for Brendan to report to 
Peter Styles during this interim period.  Peter will open discussion with 
Brendan to define what he will be doing.  We'll need to consider separately 
how to support the Continental Gas activity, given the hole this creates.

Take a look at attachment below for guidance in any discussion with Ristori 
next Wednesday re Bush energy policy statement and comparative aspects of EC 
green paper on sec. of supply. To remind you of what Loyola said on CNN 
yesterday:
 - Agrees with need to re-evaluate role of nuclear plus future investment in 
it .
 - Disagrees with weight given to supply side and indigenous sources, 
compared with demand side and fuel diversity (also from external sources?)
 - Disagrees with exclusion of climate change considerations.

Subject: Re: EC on energy market distortions  

As anticipated in Peter's e-mail below, please see attached the English 
translation of the relevant abstract (Art 15) from the minutes of yesterday's 
discussion at the Commission. It is indeed quite an encouraging read. Whereas 
the press release sent out before (attached here below as well) suggested 
that the Commission "would consider" adopting its own Directive under the 
provisions of Art. 86 (para 3), the minutes seem to go a step further and 
imply that the Commissions regards it as a next action for itself if the 
Council and the Parliament delay the adoption of the acceleration proposal. 
The text also emphasizes that the Commission's legislation will still have to 
be subject to the "obligations of services of general economic interest", 
which could of course have a negative impact on the content of the actual 
Directive.  The minutes of the Commission's meetings are binding.

Subject: Note on energy market distortions


Dear Peter,

I have unsuccessfully tried to contact you over the telephone. I therefore
attach some comments on the Commission's note on energy market distortion,
which we will be happy to discuss whenever it is most convenient for you.

The official in charge of the internal note presented today by Commissioner
de Palacio has indicated that the ongoing discussion on EdF's international
activities has required the Commission to provide some indication of what
its attitude will be in the near future regarding possible distortions of
competition in the energy sector. The official has also indicated that the
document seeks to push for the adoption of the Commission proposals for the
completion of the energy internal market which will allow to put an end to
the current distortions.
According to the press release the Commission intends to apply the Treaty's
competition rules in the energy sector and would consider to adopt Decisions
or Directive itself to address possible distortions of competition resulting
from different levels of liberalisation.
We are contacting Commissioner de Palacio's cabinet as well as some other
officials within the Commission and will report to you again on this issue
as soon as possible.

Regards,

Amaia

Doug,

A former colleague who worked for me as a trainee when I was in the 
Commission always expressed to me an interest in working in the private 
sector. Indeed, at one time she was going to work at McKinseys in Moscow but 
(I think) turned it down because she always wanted to work in the West.  She 
is Estonian and speaks Russian, Finnish (?), French and German, and her 
English is perfect. Extremely bright though relatively young (I think she 
must be 25 ish, perhap older). Studied in France and elswhere. Currently in 
the Estonian Foreign M inistry in charge of Estonian accession negotiations 
(in which role I met her professionally too). If you were looking for someone 
to cover Central and Eastern Europe, I would recommend her for hard work, 
comprehension and ability to adapt, though no knowledge of energy per se. By 
far the best trainee I ever had.  So far all I have said is that I am at 
Enron, is she still looking?

 Dear Brendan,

It was lovely to hear from you and to realise that you have finally taken the 
leap into the private sector. I was just searching high and low for you a few 
weeks ago, because I was in Brussels for almost a week and was wondering if 
we might meet up for a cup of coffee. Especially as I had news to tell - all 
going well, I will be posted at our Embassy to Belgium and Luxembourg, 
starting January 2002! At the same time, I am still in principle also keeping 
an eye out for interesting private sector opportunities (and yes, Enron's 
record is most impressive.) What does the position entail more specifically? 
What would the requirements be? 

What would you do in my place? 

Best wishes,

Kadri

Here's an attempt at some key "lessons" from CA to the UK (or vice versa as 
the case may be).  Actually they are more themes/differences/comments coming 
out of the CA experience, which will need tailoring/trimming down to fit the 
context of the actual presentation.  As I've indicated, depending on the 
point being presented, there may be a need for some caution in using the 
examples in too simplistic a context.

? Barriers to generator entry.
? Apart from the moratorium, it has been relatively easy to gain consent to 
construct new generation in the UK.  This is clearly a good thing in itself, 
but there are some potential pitfalls in just asserting this.  The entry has 
been criticised as unecessary in a market with significant overcapacity 
(indeed this was one of the justifications for the moratorium) and had 
surprisingly little impact on price for at least the first 8 years of the 
Pool. Indeed prices only fell once NP/PG divested plant.  Hence it would be 
easy to retort that new capacity was not required in the UK, the entry that 
did occur was wasteful and that the CA analogy is bogus (although clearly the 
full story is more complex than this)
? Moratorium had a significant impact on investment and stalled competition.  
(True, but difficult to sustain given that divestment and pre-committed new 
entry ensured that prices fell significantly before the moratorium was 
lifted.)
? Danger that measures designed to meet the CHP and Renewables targets 
constrain future developments and lead to capacity shortages, ie, perfection 
should not be the enemy of the good.  This is not the case currently.  
However, new applications must demonstrate that CHP has been fully explored - 
if this hurdle acquires real teeth (or turns into something more formal) then 
we could see easy consents getting significantly more difficult.  This is, 
however, largely speculation at the current time.

? Retail caps
? Purchase costs could be passed through in UK (for at least the first 8 
years).  Although some purchase costs were pseudo-regulated (through the 
vesting contracts and their replacements),  the Public Electricity Suppliers 
also purchased power from CCGTs in which they also took equity at very high 
prices.  (Teesside was one of the first examples of this.) The cost of this 
was passed through to franchise customers.  This was widely criticised and 
although the regulator allowed this to happen (on the grounds of entry 
promoting competition), the fact that all the entry was baseload and NP/PG 
still controlled the marginal plant meant that wholesale market prices didn't 
change at all.
? Since 1998, prices caps have been instituted and have not been a problem.  
Although the caps squeezed the PES margins, they could contract forward to 
hedge the risk of wholesale price movements.  Morever, the price caps have 
actually reduce wholelsale prices - generator market power meant that the 
wholesale price was, in part, a net-back from the allowed retail tariff.
? Watch out for Independent Energy, a supplier who did go bankrupt.  This was 
due to a combination of being under-hedged when power prices rose and not 
having adequate infrastructure to bill customers and get the cash in.

? Competition
? Generator concentration meant excessive prices for the first 8-9 years of 
the Pool.  Restructuring and divestment was essential to realising the 
benefits of competition.
? Retail competition has been very successful and has been a key driver in 
increasing liquidity in the wholesale market


? Stranded Costs
? Stranded cost recovery largely didn't distort the market, eg, nuclear levy, 
vesting contracts did not affect marginal decisions.  (That said market power

the needs of the miners for years.)

Hope these help.  Please let me know if you need anything further.

Philip

Attached the relevant sections of a paper produced by EFET (largely by us) on 
TPA in the French gas market and Enron comments to the EU on TPA issues. Note 
that these papers were produced in December of 2000 and mid-Feb 2001 
respectively. Notable changes since then include.

A relatively competitively priced conversion service (H-Cal to L-Cal gas) at 
TaiseniSres has been but in place 
The balancing regime has been improved and penalties are now indexed to 
Zeebrugge (x 1.5 or x -0.5)
Access conditions to LNG have been published
Flexibility services are offered by GdF- Supply. The terms and conditions up 
to now had been onerous. Recent talks between Didier and a customer suggest 
that they have been wildly improved but this still needs to analysed by us.
Transit tariffs have been published but is also restricted to a  year-long. 
The regulator is seriously considering changing the tariff structure from a 
distance related structure to a entry/exit type structure.
The first hearing on the law (directive transposition) at the parliament has 
been delayed from spring 2001 to summer 2002. Regulated tariffs will not 
likely be put in place until 2003.

Let me know if you need more information. 

Bruno

Subject: Early Warning Information: EEMF and EME in the press


Energy guru warns against dangers of 'industry squeeze'
ENERGY liberalisation in Europe is vulnerable to political interference in
the wake of the crisis on America's West Coast, according to a leading
industry player.
The warning comes from Jonathan Green, a director at Edison Mission Energy -
one of the companies caught up in the California crisis which has seen
millions of homes left without power as prices surge by up to 50%. "As a
result of California, politicians are much more sensitive now about the
possibility of things going wrong," said Green.
The London-based Edison strategist was speaking to European Voice after a
conference of major pan-European power firms at the European Energy
Millennium Forum in Brussels last week. The companies voiced their concerns
over environmental and other political factors that could squeeze the
industry, leading to the capacity problems seen across the Atlantic. "The
danger will come if there is some sort of constraint on new capacity coming
forward," Green added.
Both fuel price increases and 'stranded costs' - debt carried over from
capital investments under previous regimes - can be passed on to consumers
in the early stages of liberalisation, thereby making the process
politically unpopular.
Industry maintains that environmental pressures contributed to the
California crisis by imposing heavy costs on the building of new plants.
"Equally in Europe you can see pressures for older plants to close down
because of emissions," said Green.
Euro-MPs are currently in conciliation talks with EU governments over new
emissions limits for large power plants that could force older generators to
shut down for part of the year. Negotiations resume next week.

Fiona Grant mentioned to me that you will be speaking at the Eurelectric 
meeting in Madrid on Monday and we thought that you might therefore be 
interested to see the attached note summarising the current PR situation with 
respect to our power plant developments in Spain.  

FYI Greenpeace is lobbying the Spanish Government heavily over the next few 
days in advance of the Bush visit - according to its website, will be calling 
for the Spanish Government to prohibit the development of power plants by US 
companies in protest at his policy on Kyoto.

Subject: Arcos/Tordesillas demonstrations 

This Sunday sees the demonstration in Arcos opposing the development of CCGTs 
in the region.  It is difficult to estimate likely turnout at the event - 
however the opposition Platform has been placing ads and has organised 
several buses from outside villages.  We are in contact with the Arcos Town 
Hall to see if they will be issuing official attendance numbers in advance of 
the opposition group, which can be sure to distort numbers.

Our PR consultant is in contact today with local media and will be in Arcos 
at the weekend to gauge the mood - if the demonstration does not attract many 
supporters, we will not comment publicly.  However, we will assess the 
situation on Sunday, and if there is a very large turnout, we may set up some 
interviews for Ignacio Soneira during the afternoon with local press and 
radio.  These interviews will be used to communicate that: Enron continues to 
believe in the positive benefits of the project for the region; the project 
has been subject to extensive public consultation; we have obtained our 
Environmental Impact Declaration and a large number of other permits; 
different opinions are to be welcomed in a democracy, and in fact the project 
does have support from many parts of the local community.

It is important to note that local politicians are setting great store by the 
success or otherwise of this weekend's demonstration - one key factor will be 
the ratio of Arcos residents present versus outsiders.  We will be continuing 
with our ongoing PR activities - adverts, presentations, sponsorships, 
interviews etc - next week, so that we are not seen to be backing off from 
the project following the demonstration.

Some local politicians are predicting that the level of turnout may in the 
end depend on the weather.  


Tordesillas

The demonstration which took place a few days ago in Tordesillas did attract 
a large number of local people (in the thousands).  The Tordesillas Mayor has 
now said that if local people are against the plant, then she too is against 
the project.  Our media response on this issue is that the consultation 
process is ongoing and that the Environmental Impact Report is due out within 
the next few weeks.  

The demonstration and the Mayor's position has attracted substantial local 
press coverage - the obvious concern is that these latest developments get 
picked up by newswires (one energy publication has picked up on the 
situation) and spread through Spain to Arcos.

Jackie Gentle and I will be visiting Tordesillas and Arcos next week to 
discuss the latest developments.

Subject: RE: FW: M.1853 EDF/EnBW - EDF VPP Trustee

All

I talked to the Trustee late Friday. They are reluctant and not intending to 
meet with anyone. The want to keep their independence although they did say 
that at this point the process has been one sided. They are, however, very 
interested in getting as much information as possible for us and others. We 
should provide them copies of all the letters that we have sent to the MTF, 
EdF,  and PWC as they have not received any of that information as of yet. 
With that we should include a cover note and points on the PIM that we have 
not covered. 

When questioned on what their role was, they explained that it was to monitor 
the execution of EdF's responsibilities, set up the auction process and 
perform the auction. They must insure that the product offered by EDF is 
reasonably coherent with the conditions agreed to with the MTF, and finally 
they must insure transparency.

On the possibilities to changes certain terms conditions in the decision. 
Their role is to ensure that the remedy as agreed is followed through (they 
have no power to ensure that the greater purpose of the remedy - i.e. promote 
competition is fulfilled). Thus any fundamental changes on conditions that 
were precisely stated in the remedy (i.e. noon notification and price level - 
stated in the confidential version of the decision) will unlikely be changed, 
on these issues we can give it a go, but I see very little probability for 
success. Other issues that have not been well defined such as the schedule, 
type of  auction (SMP vs PAB) could possibly be influenced.

Let's send before meeting with the Trustee a letter similar to EdF and PWC  
letters, but incorporating comments on the PIM.

Let's prepare a draft tomorrow, that we will circulate within the group.

Michael Albers, Head of unit for Energy in DG Competition gave a talk on 
competition priorities in Brussels yesterday.

Highlights:

Priorities for DG Comp are:  1) foster supply competition; for examlpe, new 
candidate for DG Comp's help has been identified in Belgium and it would be 
necesary to intervene to help this new competitor. In merger control, 
emphasis will be on supply solutions and not transmission market issues. 2) 
Crossborder Network Access: proceedings will be initiated after the summer 
re. French/Spanish and Dutch/Belgian borders. General policy will be spelt 
out in an Art. 19(3) notice on Viking Cable. [If we want to influence general 
policy we should make a submission on this before it appears: an Art 19(3) 
notice is a Commission Decision and constitutes a binding legal precedent. 
Although comments on Viking Cable can be made after the event, we would not 
be in a position to influence the policy published in the Notice. BD to 
follow up.] 3) Eligible customers should be able to choose their suppliers: 
most cases are resolved informally. 4) State Aid especially stranded costs; 
also environmental policy notice will have impact in this area (Nailia:please 
follow up.)

Specific cases:

On UK Gas Interconnector: no news.

Long term Agreements (gas and electricity): "dominant firms cannot have 
exclusivity caluses, and long-term contracts as such may be a problem".

SNAM/GAZPROM contracts: destination clauses are illegal, Commission to 
initiate proceedings after the Summer break; there will be no blue lining, 
meaning that in a contract where a clause is illegal, the Commission will 
press for the contract to be terminated, and not allow the contract to 
continue intact but the offending article 'blue lined' out. [This suggests we 
ought to offer some thoughts on draft model long term contracts.BD to follow 
up.]  Applicable mutatis mutandisto GFU contracts.

A gas case that will specify the limits of gas TPA regimes will be "heard 
more of after the summer break". (Access to Pipelines Case, TPA ex.-Emden, is 
my guess.)

Gas Release Programmes: no indication that this was an emerging issue: Albers 
offered no views.

Art 86(3) Directive -- cannot achieve what one can with an Art 95 Directive 
(I will write a separate explanation of this -- basically an Art 86(3) 
Directive cannot force regulatory structures on countries, i.e. a regulator, 
but can change a company's behaviour, i.e. account unbundling.)


Any views welcome

Brendan

I would add to what Teun says below a good lesson from California for the 
Dutch: Disconnect the functioning of the retail and wholesale markets at your 
peril. If bad regulatory/ political  intervention gets in the way of 
participation by new and old players in both on a level playing field, 
fingers will get burnt. In the Netherlands the incumbent generators and 
vertically integrated distributors have been given unfair advantages in a 
non-transparent manner in the wholesale market, whilst enjoying more or less 
guaranteed prices in the retail market. New entrants/ importers got squeezed 
and most consumers have not yet enjoyed the full benefits of liberalisation. 
Incidentally, in both California and the Netherlands there was excessive 
political trumpeting of the benefits and of the enlightenment of policymakers 
in advance, followed by a mess in practice.

Peter, Nailia,

Today Dutch bank holiday, heard nevertheless your voicemail, please find 
below initial thoughts in bullet format:



Why California cannot happen in the Dutch market:

? Plenty installed capacity available 
Available import capacity about 30% of total demand
Price cap for distco's based on real quarterly purchase portfolio and 
industry average index 


Why California nevertheless -in the longer run- can happen:

? CHP plants are closed down and large generators are shutting down plants
Lack of grid system transparency with regards to importcapacity, operational 
aspects of the grid, balancing market etc. Biased signals to the market.  
Market structure with limited number of players therefore lack of 
competition. Prices do not reflect underlying market supply and demand ratio. 
Therefore new entrants are hesitating to add new assets to the market.
Environmental and spatial permits are time consuming processes. (e.g. 
National Government faces large resistance of local authorities against the 
siting of windmills). Governmental Policy aims at state of the art technology 
of new additions to the powerplantmix. Environmental Impact Report often 
necessary.

See dinner invite below. I am in Amsterdam anyway for meetings 6th and 7th. 
ABN Amro are relationship lenders to Enron Europe. Roger Harvey used to be in 
project finance team (from where I know him.) He now looks after the bank's 
energy clients for UK, NL and Germany. Two or three other companies may be 
represented at the dinner. Roger has invited us to dinner on the 6th in the 
context of the "Energy in Europe" conference, at which I am speaking 7th am 
and chairing a panel discussion among regulators 7th pm. 

Before the dinner there will be time for you to meet Prof. Littlechild again 
mid-pm (after your train journey from Brussels and Teun's and my lunchtime 
session with him) and then hold a review of Dutch developments with Teun. 

On morning of 7th you will fly to Paris.

Thanks Brendan. Bio would be useful. I am not able to join you that day 
because I shall be in NL (thus please present my apologies.) But I have asked 
Bruno to come to Brussels to accompany you and Rick, because we have some hot 
issues on Belgian and French power markets. To lend balance you could present 
some German and Dutch power issues on which Paul H/ Teun/ I can brief you. 
Also a chance to go over the most egregious barriers to entry on the gas 
side, which Doug will no doubt guide you on. So here's my idea for an agenda 
to be sent to Ristori in advance:
 1. Belgian power - status of Commission infringement action - our experience 
of continuing closure of market, inability to transit power - inaction of 
CREG.
 2. French power - forthcoming VPP auctions - our experience with border 
transmission capacity auctions and ex post border congestion charges - 
arguments about "reciprocity" vis a vis neighbouring Member States.
 3. NL borders LT transmission capacity reservations - still distorting power 
market - principle of ATC netting.
 4. German export and import related power transmission tariffs - status of 
Commission discussions with German government post Florence?
 5. German gas TPA.
 6. French gas TPA.
 7. Madrid process - forthcoming June meeting.
 8. Progress of Commission's liberalisation acceleration proposals - outcome 
of Energy Council and plans for parliamentary debates.
 9. Ten minutes from Rick of "California power crisis 101".

Teun: Note that earliest poss. appointment on 6th for Rick in Den Haag or 
Amsterdam would be mid pm. Bruno still working on meetings in Paris for 7th.

Aitor Moso of Iberdrola told me in Madrid yesterday that Iberdrola have 
"inherited", at least for a few months, 550 MW of import capacity under use 
it or lose it rules introduced by RTE in '99 or '00. Apparently EdF had kept 
using that capacity till early Winter, then kept nominating it for use, but 
actually did not use it for four months. The reason was excess hydropower 
availability in Spain driving prices down. Once the four month period 
expired, EdF lost the capacity rights and Iberdrola jumped in and booked it. 
I assume Raphael and Paul are aware of all this.

I was also told that RTE is holding a seminar on their France-Spain 
interconnection capacity auction proposals in Paris next Monday. Iberdrola, 
Endesa and Hidrocantabrico (not surprisingly!) seem to be supportive. Are we 
attending?

All these developments will of course be relevant to our answers to the Phase 
2 questionnaire. When it arrives (tomorrow or Monday?) we may only be given a 
few days to answer it. Are we prepared?  Bruno and Nailia have some days off 
in the next week or so let's get to work in advance - providing Ross, 
Mariano, Paul and Gregor back an intervention. The three previous submissions 
to DG COMP to work off are:
 a) '99  (?) on France/ Spain exports,
 b) '00 on EdF/ EnBW, and
 c) '01 on EdP/ Hidrocantabrico.

I foresee the most obvious remedies to target being:
 1) Freeing up LTRs on interconnectors.
 2) Enhancing VPP auctions.

Subject: FW: Commission press release


The EC is launching a phase two investigation on EDF's acquisition of 
Hidrocantabtrico. They fear EDF's presence in the Spanish market will reduce 
their incentives to built new interconnectors: "Once it has a foothold in 
Spain, it might presumably be less interested in increasing competition in 
the Spanish market via imports and hence could prevent any increase in the 
capacity of French interconnectors with Spain. It is recalled that all 
imports of electricity in Spain (with the exception of Portugal) need to go 
through the French grid and the French interconnectors". Mario Monti added 
"Separately, my services are also actively investigating whether EdF may have 
discriminated against third parties regarding access to the interconnector 
cables that carry electricity between France and Spain." I assume that OMEL 
(and REE?) is active in that case. However, we also have evidence that RTE is 
not optimising capacity and allowing historic users to block capacity. Do we 
want to get involved, and can we, in the "active case" (with OMEL or 
independently)? Do we want to get involved, and can we, in the acquisition 
case?

Dear Nailia,

Please find attached a press release issued by the Commission today
regarding the ongoing investigation on the acquisition by Spanish Group
Villar Mir and EnBW of Spanish utility Hidrocantabrico. The Commission fears
that the acquisition by EdF, through EnBW, would limit the interconnection
capacity between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe.

Just to underline that these reports confirm what I had reported 
independently, namely that if the Commission is thwarted by the Member States 
over the acceleration directives and regulation that the Commission will use 
its powers unilaterally to pass the legislation using an Art 86(2) Directive 
(previously only used in the telecomms sector, these powers allow the 
Commission to not even consult the Member States or the European 
parliament).  The Commission has legal authority to do this and political 
cover as the Stockholm Conclusions indicate the strengthened use of 
competition law. Art 86 of the Amsterdam Treaty is within the Competition 
provisions. That said, one can see a definitive timetable emerging for market 
liberalisation; my bet is that the laws will be in place by this time next 
year, just after the French elections.  This contradicts the estimate 
supplied by some Parlementarians in the newspapers, such as todays FT, which 
suggest a five year time frame; perhaps the MEPs don't realise that the 
legislation may never get to them.

An interesting thought: if the legislation is passed under Art 86 we may get 
better legislation: there will be no need to compromise for Council and 
parliament sensitivities.

The plan reforecast we went through after Q1 resulted in a reduced expense 
base of $28m for the year.  This is still short of our target of $50m to 
$100m.  As you are aware we reforecast our expenses on a quarterly basis and 
for Q2 I want you to work with your management accountant to produce the 
below pack by June 30th.  Management accounting will critic the packs and 
provide a detailed analysis of overs and unders to the Office of the Chair.  
If necessary meetings will be held with you and the Office of the Chair to go

Subject: RE: EFET Meeting with the CREG/Union Miniere feedback

 Ross, Paul

We had good feedback from Union Miniere on the Belgian situation yesterday.  
Apparently the Febeliec press release on the competitive situation in Belgium 
went down very badly in the government.  Febeliec got a letter back saying 
that the govt was "disappointed and unhappy" with the letter, noting that the 
govt priorities were the Belgian presidency of the EU, the finances of the 
communes (whose finances are of course completely wrapped up with 
Electrabel's extraction of revenues from captive customers) and something 
along the lines of "preserving the traditions of Belgian electricity 
supply".  Furthermore, there are suggestions of veiled threats (not from the 
government directly, but from those working closely with govt) of 
"retribution" ( taxes/environmental burdens) -presumably if Febeliec don't 
lay off.  Also confirmed Bruno's CREG feedback that border issues are not a 
priority.

UM however is going to persist.  Senior management (Marcel Goetstouwers, VP 
of Purchasing & Transportation) wants us to go back next week and present to 
him why exactly we can't commit to delivering firm on the Belgian grid next 
year and what it takes for us to be able to do so.  He intends to use this 
material in his upcoming meeting with the Minister.  We have of course been 
explaining all along the difficulties, but it has taken their recent Belgian 
tender (in response to which they received no offers apart from their 
Electrabel offer plus our OTM option) for him to take the issues seriously.  
UM is also talking again about complaints to the Commission, which they may 
actually do now (possibly).  

Our OTM option remains on the table and we can discuss it again after their 
visit to the Minister.

Against this background, the CREG refusal to meet with Enron is obviously 
symptomatic of the general attitude of the govt.  EFET Belgium needs to take 
this into account in moving forward. (Bruno - why not get some feedback 
directly, and independently, from Febeliec - and see if it confirms or not 
UM's report.)

On the test sale to Electrabel on the Belgian grid, I will take this forward 
with Jonathan on his return on Tuesday.  Following the recent 
pressure/letters from us on the issue to CPTE, they had indicated ARP trading 
on the grid would be in place by 1 July but this has since slipped to Sep or 
Oct, and of course, there is no CPTE commitment on paper anyway (a promised 
press release on the subject is probably being saved for the announcement of 
the nomination of the TS0, expected 21 July).  It will be interesting to see 
if Electrabel still give us a price, since there have been CPTE/Electrabel 
discussions on the matter since we raised it.

Just to clarify, we can buy from Electrabel in Belgium, but are told we can 
not SELL to them in Belgium.  Perhaps an even more crazy situation!

BTW, we intend to challenge this by doing a deal and just submitting a 
schedule.  Philip, what is the status of this?

Bruno,

As you say not unexpected!  

Were they quoting the govt in terms of their intentions to not open the 
market?  How does this approach play in terms of the Belgium presidency?

As a simple example, we face the ludicrous situation that CPTE allows us to 
wheel power through Belgium from Fr to NL (et vv) but refuses to allow us to 
buy from or sell to Electrabel - with significant implications for the Dutch 
as well as Belgium markets, given Electrabel's strong position in both 
markets.  In that this is a cross border issue the EU ie TREN and/or COMP 
should take more interest.......but probably only if prodded by the Dutch to 
conisder it more of a priority (and pigs might fly on that one?)?

Obviously position of TREN key on this - what hot buttons can we press 
(assuming Dutch do nothing)?  Is there action that could be taken or 
threatened against Electrabel (although this would obviously need to be 
justified by lengthy and difficult abuse investigation or such like).  Is the 
reported Electrabel/Distrigas "concert" another angle to raise with 
TREM/COMP?  Could CPTE be fined?

Regards,

Ross

Subject: EFET Meeting with the CREG - Elect. and Gas

The meeting yesterday with the CREG was very disappointing although not 
surprising. We met Christine VANDERVEEREN - President and Department for 
dispute settlement, Thomas LEKANE - Director of the technical operation of 
the electricity market,  Jean-Paul PINON - Director of the technical 
operation of the gas market, and Fran?ois POSSEMIERS - Director of gas price 
control. The attitude of Ms VANDERVEEREN was one of resignation and apathy, 
Mr. LEKANE was very defensive (and did not seem to understand the issues i.e. 
did not understand the exchanging of energy blocks), M. PINON was the only 
one that seemed pro-active, open and wiling to listen to market participants, 
and Mr. POSSEMIERS did not say anything. 

Electricity

We presented the situation - no access to market/transit, quasi monopoly 
situation at the detriment to consumers,  no wholesale and retail market, no 
wholesale trading allowed. We insisted that in the short -term, capacity 
should be available on a UIOLI bases, block exchanges should be put in place 
ASAP. They indicated that only the strict minimum was going to be implemented 
in the short run. In particular, at the end of the meeting M. Vanderverren 
told me that the government had no intention of opening up the market for 
competition and that their only intention was to focus on internal market 
issues, and not border issues, to insure the transposition of the directive 
to fend off the Commission's latest  infringement action. 
  
The CREG is still operating under the "we have no power" mode. The tension 
between the CREG and the ministry is obvious and politically motivated. The 
CREG gives the impression that they are subject to the ministry's power, they 
are only acting as an administrator for the ministry in providing advice on 
proposed legislation.   The CREG continues to claim that they are not able to 
impose any rules or regulation on CPTE as CPTE is not the nominated TSO. They 
also seem to fend off any offer for us to consult on any issues other than 
draft decrees and certain "indicative plans" that are envisage (see below). 

Status of TSO designation:
The TSO should be nominated on 21/7. All important decrees will be passed by 
the 20/7. This includes the grid code, tariff related decrees (need 
precisions), and a new decree requiring licensing for intermediaries 
(including suppliers and traders).  Regarding this issue, the CREG is against 
additional licences but see this requirement unavoidable (due to political 
will), and asked that we provide them with comments once the proposed decree 
is available (with the condition that there will be very little time to 
provide for comments)        

Grid Code
According to a prior conversation I had with the secretary cabinet, the grid 
code should be issued by the end of June at the latest. They are still 
considering including a concentration process on specific issues. EFET will 
be scheduling a meeting with the cabinet shortly.   

Border capacity allocation:
It seems that the only change in allocation that they are considering is one 
that would implement auctions by 2002 (this what they consider to be the 
short term solution). In the long term Leanne explained that the preferred 
solution would be market splitting. They are not considering any type on 
UIOLI procedure in the immediate (despite our stressing that this should be 
easily implementable).

Trading Arrangements:
We also insisted on the need to implement ASAP block exchange procedures. It 
seemed that Lekane did not understand the issue and implied that his comments 
on  the grid code did not envisage that because of the limited time they had 
to offer comments to the ministry. (Again in previous conversation with the 
energy cabinet they are considering to include that notion and are possibly 
looking to ask for a formal consultation process)

Envisaged Consultation:
Electric: 
 Decree on licences,
 Projected demand for the next ten years - projected imports, exports and 
transits - need for production
Gas: 
 Projected demand for the next ten years - the need for flexibility, 
competition, ....
 New Grid Code: Changes to the existing proposed grid code to incorporate the 
new law.  

Next steps:
EFET decided to try meet with the Energy cabinet within two weeks. Is 
Envisaging meeting with Christopher Jones by the end of the month.
Enron is continuing to actively talk with the Energy Cabinet (next issue to 
discuss are UIOLI capacity allocation, trading arrangements). June 6 Meeting 
with DGTREN to expose barriers in BE market. (At the end of the CREG meeting 
I asked that they meet with Enron and the responded that they did not have 
the time)

Here's my second response to you, as promised, Ursula.
The implications of the policy-related aspects of the California crisis for 
liberalisation of European energy markets, and for restructuring of the 
electricity sector over here in particular, effectively constituted the 
"unscripted" part of my address at the Eurelectric confence in Madrid this 
morning. (As you are aware, I was replacing Steve Kean.) Partly because of a 
request of the Eurelectric secretariat, but also for use at a forthcoming 
European gov. affairs offsite, I have turned my remarks into legible speaking 
notes over lunchtime today. Pamela Milano in my Brussels office will put them 
into Word format by the end of this week and we may also prepare some slide 
bullets based on the notes. I hope this material will then be of use to you 
in preparation for the Repsol YPF/ Harvard event.

I've arranged 2 meeting in Paris on with EFET- France re gas issues. The 
agenda will include our take on what is going on in the US and French Gas 
issues. I have a feeling unfortunately that this meeting will not be well 
attended as we set it up farley late. Caroline Lambinon from Dalkia (French 
ESP with EDF, Vivendli ownership) is the only person that has responded. 

The second meeting is with the French regulator. Again the opportunity to 
meet with them is based on the Cal experience. Michel Massoni will be present 
with others yet to be determined.   Massoni is the director for the 
department in charge of  relations with Third Parties. I will forward you 
more information on the French market. I will also be present at the meeting 
on Tuesday at the EU.

Background

The Continental European electricity market is developing from an integrate=
d=20
monopoly business to a competitive market. A segment of electricity users n=
ow=20
have the right to choose their supplier from a range of marketers. The=20
emergence of new marketers and generators has created the demand for price=
=20
risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20
wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=
=20
December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=
=20
national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=
=20
1999.

The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20
electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20
1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20
average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=
=20
than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=
=20
lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=
=20
opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=
s=20
a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20
expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.

At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=
r=20
states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=
=20
Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=
t=20
an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20
having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=
=20
proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20

Current Market

EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20
producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20
exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =
in=20
France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20
thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=
=20
with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=
nd=20
distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=
e=20
French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=
) are=20
also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=
h,=20
hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=
=20
production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20

More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession areas.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20
transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=
d=20
on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=
r=20
maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW.=20

A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three-year contractual framework. =20

Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=
=20
have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20
responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=
s=20
the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=
=20
equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20
published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=
0%=20
tolerance level or 5MW.=20

Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20
ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20
real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=
he=20
availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=
=20
balancing responsibility contracts has created the basic conditions for an=
=20
effective power trading market in France, and this through the exchange of=
=20
blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20
day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=
l=20
transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20

The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=
=20
of players for trading, imports, exports and transit; we are confident that=
=20
the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20
Resources Limited ("ECTRL") is a balancing responsible actor in France and=
=20
closed the first physical power transaction in France early 2000, and was t=
he=20
very first new entrant to trade power (buy/sell) in France late 2000.   =20

Future Developments

France's size and geographical position will make it a natural hub for=20
trading on the Continent. It is Europe's second largest electricity market,=
=20
with net consumption (including industrial on-site consumption) totalling=
=20
over 400 TWh in 1999. The increase of physical trading, envisaged capacity=
=20
release by EDF, and creation of future market mechanism will contribute to=
=20
the further development of the market.

Both a balancing market and a spot exchange market are expected to be=20
implemented by end 2001. Players in the balancing market will propose put a=
nd=20
call options, exercised by RTE according to its own portfolio of contacts=
=20
(producer, consumer) and providing it with physical balancing capacity. The=

services.
=20
Some of the spot market volume is expected to be operated by ParisBourse.=

However, due to the dominant position of EDF, the limited number of active=

and the lack of transparency with regard to current rules for allocation of=
=20
cross-border capacity and attribution of congestion costs, we believe that=
=20
the conditions for the creation of an effective spot power market in France=
=20
are not yet fully met.=20

Recently, the European Commission has asked EDF to auction 6,000MW of virtu=

in=20
the face of price decreases. France has transposed the directive, however=
=20
certain imperfection with regards to non-discriminatory access and the leve=
l=20
of liberalisation still exist.=20

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=
an=20
required by the EU, establishing a transitional regime for third party acce=
ss=20
(TPA). Several application decrees still have to be passed, including=20
transportation tariffs on the electric grid to eligible customers. The=20
current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of auto-consumption) per ye=
ar=20
and per site, and represents about 600 eligible clients and 1,200 sites.=20
Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible=
=20
consumption of customers located in their concession areas. The French powe=
r=20
market is effectively open to some competition, and about 60 eligible=20

supplier. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh per site by=20
direct application of the EU Directive by Feb. 2003, as the French governme=

declined a quicker opening of the power market.

The two main authorities, which oversee the industry, are the CRE (Commissi=

ministry of industry. The CRE is responsible to insure that RTE provides fo=

IPPs and for determining eligibility issues.      =20

RTE is implementing new capacity allocation procedures on the UK, Italy and=
=20
Spain interconnectors. On the remaining borders, capacity is currently=20
allocated on a first-come-first served basis rule, and congestion fees are=

risk management solutions and has encouraged the development of a traded=20
wholesale market. Following the adoption of the EU Electricity Directive in=
=20
December 1996, member states were obliged to transpose the directive into=
=20
national legislation opening electricity markets to competition by February=
=20
1999.

The directive sets out a three-tiered approach to the liberalisation of=20
electricity supply markets. Stage one entered into effect on 19 February=20
1997, and calls for the opening of 22% of national markets, based on the=20
average community share of electricity consumed by end customers using more=
=20
than 40 GWh per year. The degree of opening will increase over six years by=
=20
lowering the community consumption threshold to 20 GWh in 2000 (27% market=
=20
opening) and to 9 GWh in 2003 (32-33% market opening). Distributor access i=
s=20
a matter for each member state. The implementation of a new directive,=20
expected in 2002, will improve the conditions for a liberalized market.

At present, the level of compliance with the directive varies between membe=
r=20
states. The EU countries farthest along the process of liberalisation are=
=20
Germany, Austria, Spain and the Netherlands. Switzerland, although it is no=
t=20
an EU member state, is integral to market developments. France, although=20
having chosen to comply with the minimum requirements of the directive, has=

proven to open up their market more than expected.   =20

Current Market

EDF is the dominant electricity producer in France, the largest power=20
producer in the world with 475TWh generated in 2000,  and the largest=20
exporter in Europe (net exports reached 71 TWh in 2000).  Power generation =
in=20
France is mainly nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional=20
thermal generation represents 10%. EDF is a vertically integrated company=
=20
with services and products in generation (92%), supply (?%), transmission a=
nd=20
distribution (95%). Finally, this historical supplier is a State Entity; th=
e=20
French State owns EDF=01,s capital.  A few Independent Power Producers (IPP=
) are=20
also active in the market, such as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TW=
h,=20
hydro). Other smaller IPPs are commercially active but most must sell their=
=20
production to EDF under a regulated tariff.=20

More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession areas.

The French System Operator (RTE) was created on 1 July 2000 and is a=20
sub-division of EDF, although it is unbundled in terms of management and=20
accounting. A postage stamp tariff has been implemented under the=20
transitional regime, which varies according to the voltage used and is base=
d=20
on a matrix (Summer/Winter, Peak/Off-Peak). Users have to contract for thei=
r=20
maximum transmission capacity. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW.=20

A three-year framework contract (e.g., by way of a Master Agreement with a=
=20
minimum term of three years) is required for eligible customers, but=20
eligibles are free to deal for shorter maturity transactions within such a=
=20
three-year contractual framework. =20

Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and eligible customers=
=20
have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has created balancing=20
responsibility contracts (contrats de Responsable d'Equilibre) which compel=
s=20
the aggregation of imbalance charges for different eligible sites within an=
=20
equilibrium perimeter defined with RTE. Imbalances are settled under a=20
published tariff which charges a heavy penalty for any imbalance beyond a 1=

Even though we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the=20
ability to trade power already exists. Optimisation can be found through=20
real-time arbitrage offered by the flexibility of the industrial process, t=

availability of market prices and optional structures. The establishment of=

blocks from one perimeter to another. Blocs are only exchangeable on=20
day-ahead bases but intra-day procedures are expected to be implemented. Al=

transactions are currently based on bilateral physical contracts.=20

The establishment of this framework has contributed to an increasing number=

the French power market will develop rapidly.     Enron Capital & Trade=20

Future Developments

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, a year later  th=

Eligibility for distribution companies is currently limited to the eligible=

Updated May 2001.

1)Background

France is the second largest country in Europe with 58 million inhabitants.=
=20
EdF, who was the monopolistic producer, is the largest power producer in th=
e=20
world with 475TWh generated in 2000, thanks to nuclear production. The=20
historical supplier, who is at the same time the largest exporter of power =
in=20
Europe (net exports reached 71TWh in 2000), is a direct emanation from the=
=20
French State, who owns EdF capital. Power generation in France is mainly=20
nuclear (70%), but also hydro (20%), while conventional thermal generation=
=20
represents 10%. EdF owns 92% of power generation, and 95% of distribution.=
=20

A few Independent Power Producers (IPP) are also active in the market, such=
=20
as Snet (6.4TWh, coal-fired), and CNR (16TWh, hydro). Other small IPPs sell=
=20
their production to EdF under a regulated tariff. There has been significan=
t=20
development of cogeneration projects since 1997. There is now 3,500MW of=20
installed capacity, thanks to the legal obligation for EdF to purchase powe=
r=20
generated from cogeneration units at a preferable (is "preferable" the=20
correct word??)   tariff. In the view of the transposition of  the EU=20
Electricity Directive into French law, this purchase obligation ceased to=
=20
apply for new large projects (over 12MW) from 1st Jan. 1999.
More than 100 distribution companies are active through a concession regime=
=20
in their local distribution area. Few, however, are of a significant size=
=20
(less than a dozen have sales of over 400 GWhs), or have eligible customers=
=20
in their concession area.

2) Regulatory Environment

The French Electricity law was passed on 10 February 2000, implementing=20
regulated third party access (TPA) in France under a transitional regime. T=

=20
Dozens  ["Dozens"  - I would replace this with "Several")  of application=
=20
decrees still have to be passed, including tariffs to eligible industrials.=
=20
The French power market is open to competition, however. About 60 eligible=
=20
industrials have so far switched totally or partly from the historical=20
supplier. Current threshold for eligibility is 16GWh (net of=20
auto-consumption) per year and per site, representing about 600 eligible=20
clients and 1,200 sites. The eligibility threshold will be reduced to 9GWh=
=20
per site by direct application of the EU Directive in Feb. 2003, as the=20

to the maximum capacity that they will use. RTE purchases excess capacity=
=20
available through transmission contracts at fixed prices, which represents=
=20
about half of the market price. Imbalances are settled under a published=20
tariff, which introduces high charges for imbalances beyond a 10% tolerance=
=20
level and 5MW. Although the criteria for eligibility is per site, and=20
eligible customers have to contract transmission for each site, RTE has=20

body, which mainly covers TPA and tariff issues, while IPP licenses and=20
eligibility issues are covered by the Ministry of Industry.      =20
      =20
3) Business Opportunity

Although we are currently under a transitional regime in France, the abilit=

Subject: RE: EdF capacity auctions

All,

I would suggest we need to do the following :- 

? Register for the auction and receipt of the IM asap.  Bruno could you 
please discuss with Mark and put together our registration document.  I 
assume that ECTRL meets the criteria of a trader "registered" in an EU member 
state?  Does not appear to be any need to deal with credit support or other 
regulatory "qualifiers" such as balancing agreements as yet.  Mark - agree?  
Bruno - could you please take care of sending this registration letter (agree 
with Pierre who should act as principal contact).
? Establish once and for all the role of Trustee and CRE in the process of 
approving capacity release phasing, auction process for each phase and 
product specifications AND understand how the "consultation" process will 
work once we have the IM.  Hence need to discuss with MTF, then Trustee and 
CRE asap ie in June if possible.  Preferably before we meet again with 
PWC/Roth....

In addition to Pierre's comments, the PIM also states that strike prices at 
least are subject to Trustee review but a number of areas need to be 
questioned.

? Capacity Release Phasing.  PIM confirms the 5 year period of the remdey but 
also says a review can be requested after 3 years.  Bruno - you need to 
review the remedy doc, but I do not see how a 2 year phasing of capacity 
release complies with the remedy (at least in spirit).  We would suggest 
there is no impediment to offering the FULL remedy in a single phase.  If 
theere is insufficient demand they can always have a fall back position to 
release unsold capacity on a 6 monthly or annual basis through the 5 year 
period.  The current proposal is no more than EdF trying to minimise capacity 
release and/or extract max value (can't blame them for trying but it is not 
what we want or what remedy requires).  EdF's only real argument is that 
phasing will allow more new suppliers to enter at a later date as eligiblity 
threshold drops in France.  However, since eligible demand already exceeds 
total capacity release this would limit development of competition to 
existing eligibles.  As a minimum the release programme for all capacity 
should be clearly defined up front; not at the whim of EdF.  Peter - thoughts 
on this and how, in context of remedy, we can argue for accelerated single 
phase auction (with possible reauctioning of unsold capacity over 5 years)?
? Auction Process : qualifying criteria likely to be more defined in IM; but 
no obvious problems here.  I am less sure about nature of auction process.  
We obviously need to think it through more, but why not just have a simple 
process based on single sealed bids (or an electronic bid process).  The use 
of price "clock" controlled by the auctioneer may allow a reserve price to be 
set which is clearly not the intent of the remedy - this should be set at 
zero for all product groups not subjectively "to ensure excess demand" but 
only for certain groups!
? Product Specs : need to understand what if anything can be changed here.  
Strikes seem to be subject to Trustee approval, but we need to understand 
what else can be influenced eg within day flex.  Since we have already 
covered this in previous submissions to MTF, EdF etc this should be easy to 
identify as we go forward.

Any comments?

Ross

Point 1.5: This info is of a preliminary nature and is subject to change. In 
addition, it is mentioned in point 6 that registered companies for the 
auction will have the opportunity to ask questions and raise issues during 
conferences, which will be then considered by EdF.

Specifications of the auction will be finalised by end August. This seems to 
leave some room for a complete feedback from registered companies. Let's 
discuss the content of the PIM.

I suggest to arrange anothe meeting with PWC/Rothschild in the next few weeks 
(week 11-16 June). 

What about a potential meeting with the Trustee about the PIM?

Bruno,

Quel surprise.  Should make your follow up with the MTF interesting as to the 
role of the Trustee.

One point to note for both MTF and Albers at COMP - the lack of within day 
flexibility is hardly in keeping with the intention of supporting development 
of retail supply to end users with fluctuating demand.  Suppliers will thus 
be at the mercy of EdF in the balancing market.

In addition, how on earth can they be allowed to take 2 years to complete the 
process?  How does that fit with merger remedy?

Somewhat ironic that they have the document in English!

Lets discuss what if anyhting we can do after you have spoken with MTF.

Regards,

Ross

Obviously a done deal - interestingly the Trustee is not mentioned. EDF has 
the capacity offering on its web page 
http://www.edf.fr/htm/en/enchere/enchere and has a detailed document in 
English but not in French yet. They also has EFET under industry links as 
well as the CRE, DIGEC. 

Attached is EDF's presentation of the product. After a quick look, it seems 
that flexibility is not a option (nomination at noon, and price has not 
changed)

31/05/01 UK: EDF ISSUES DETAILS OF ITS FIRST CAPACITY AUCTION.
LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - French utility Electricite de France (EdF) 
announced on Thursday details of its first auction to sell electricity 
production capacity to competitors. EdF was required by the EU Commission in 
February to give access to some of its generation capacity as a condition for 
EU approval of its purchase of a 25 percent stake in German utility EnBW.
In the next two years, EdF will auction a total of 6,000 megawatts which 
include 1,000 MW of peak capacity sold at a price of 26 euros per megawatt 
hour (MWh) and 4,000 MW of baseload at a price of eight euros/MWh.
In addition, 1,000 MW of cogeneration production capacity will be made 
available. Production from cogeneration plants is bought by EdF from smaller 
producers under long-term contracts.
"With such contracts, electricity suppliers and traders will be able to have 
electricity without the technical and operational risks of running a power 
plant," said EdF in a statement.
The price for cogeneration capacity will be made public a few weeks before 
the auction as it depends on gas price movements, EdF said.
The auction will take place in several tranches, the first one starting in 
September, when 200 MW of peak capacity will be auctioned, 800 MW of baseload 
and 190 MW of cogeneration.
The whole 6,000 MW should be sold by October 2003.
EdF, which has a 94 percent share of the French generation market, has a 
total installed capacity of 103,500 MW.

SPAIN AND CALIFORNIA

Please, note that the regulator (CNE, advisory body) has recently declared 
that "the California situation cannot happen in Spain, although it is likely 
that some isolated blackouts may happen in the East coast this summer".


Physical crisis in Spain

To me, it is not necessary to have a total blackout to admit that load 
margins in the Spanish power market have been recently decreasing, and that 
more generation capacity is needed! In fact, REE (Red Electrica de Espana, 
the transmission company and TSO) is relatively worried about shortages of 
capacity if demand keeps growing as in the recent years (6-8 percent). In 
Spain, no major power plants have been built in the last 20 years. The 
avalanche of new generation projects that have been announced (including 
Enron's Arcos CCGT 1200MW) since 1998 (outset of liberalisation) could cope 
with the need of new generation if firm access to gas transportation, 
regasification and transportation infrastructures is guaranteed.

Authorisation procedures for the construction of new power plants is not that 
bad, and so it is connection to the electricity grid. However, access to gas 
pipelines still remains  as the big issue to ensure the gas arrives to these 
new gas fired power plants, but mostly, that some of the CCGTs projects (as 
Enron's) get financed (find attached the memo about the Enron's Arcos power 
plant). Pipelines are owned are managed by Enagas, which is 100 percent owned 
by Gas Natural, who controls more than 95% of gas supplies in Spain. 

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Prompt and adequated development of the gas system to make sure new gas 
fired plants are built.
2. For these new CCGTs to get financed, it is necessary that firm and 
continuous access is ensured by Enagas.  


Financial crisis in Spain

The regulator has also said that given the "vertically integrated structure 
of the Spanish power utilities, it is impossible that the California's 
financial crisis happen". This is only partially true because the CTCs buffer 
(stranded costs payments) have mitigated the financial stress of the 
utilities when they have faced increasing fuel costs. In reality, what will 
prevent a financial crisis in Spain will be the Government, by increasing 
tariffs if things go nasty.

However, from the Enron perspective, the existence of CTCs is distorting the 
market, both for retailing activities and the development of power projects, 
since market prices are not driven by demand and supply fundamentals.


MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the speed of liberalisation of the power market and the attempts 
of the Spanish goverment to make the transitional period as short as 
possible. (By 2003, all customers will be eligible).
2. It is necessary to go deeper into the separation of regulated 
(distribution) and non-regulated activities (generation and supply), 
facilitating the introduction of more competitors on the generation market, 
and reducing the market share of incumbents.


ITALY AND CALIFORNIA

Similar messages regarding the development of the gas system in Italy as 
those in Spain are equally valid. In addition, please note.

MESSAGES (they are not confrontational to anybody)
1. Applaud the recent efforts by the goverment to make simpler and more 
expedite the authorisation processes for building new power plants.
2. It is imperative that the Italian TSO facilitates the localisation of new 
power plants by providing accurate and prompt information about the 
transmission system capacity and expansion plans. The TSO must be there to 
help new developers (actually, the Italian TSO is very aware of this and has 
publicly declared to wish to go in this direction).
3. The Italian Power Pool was due for Jan 2001, but its start has being 
delayed, and it is uncertain when it will happen. For new entrants, to have 
the Pool live and running is of special interest to a) increase the 
understanding of the supply and demand fundamentals in the Italian market and 
b) to increase liquidity. Also, make sure you mention that the Pool should 
help entry by providing as much as detailed information as possible to all 
participants, mostly on its inception phase.  


Please, find attached a short summary of the Arcos situation. The main issue 
here is that Enagas (gas transco monopoly) is trying to grant access to 
transportation and regasfication infrastructures CONDITIONAL to the 
construction of a number of new infrastructures, which are also subject to 
obtaining permits issued by the authorities. Instead, the regulator (CNE) has 
basically imposed Enagas an obligation to build and grant access to Enron on 
a firm and continuous basis, that is, no conditional. The regulator's 
decision is binding but not normative.

He has started work. Basic scope of two papers is already identified. I 
scheduled meetings for him all day in London on Monday with colleagues 
covering various EU countries, including Paul and Paul. I have tentatively 
arranged to see him again myself in Brussels or Amsterdam on 1 June, but we 
could try to postpone that to 6 June. I am not personally convinced that, 
with Michael Brown intending a blitz on consultants, Littlechild is 
particularly good value for money - a potentially potent missile, but clumsy 
to target! We can terminate him as from end August. 

I will call you about your schedule of visits/ itinerary.

Dear Mark
 
We had a brief but helpful meeting on 7 February,  since when I have 
discussed and signed a contract with Annette Patrick. I was  hoping to begin 
work before now, but two lengthy trips abroad have precluded  this. I thought 
it would be helpful to recap where we now are and what I have in  mind.
 
You summarised the three topics where further work  would be helpful to you as
1. What went wrong in California? (and why it  should not preclude further 
liberalisation in Europe)
2. The importance of accelerated EU directives,  including the importance of 
separation of functions.
3. The importance of retail marketing, including to  residential customers.
 
On the first topic, I have recently published a  paper in the Journal of 
Applied Corporate Finance, Winter 2001 edition (which  incidentally features 
Enron in a couple of the other articles). Copy attached.  Most of it is 
familiar stuff but there is a concluding section on California  which answers 
the What went wrong question. We could aim to bring this to a  wider 
audience, but there are lots of papers on this topic now, and the  situation 
changes almost daily, so it may be better to incorporate it into a  paper on 
Europe.
 
On the second topic, I accepted an invitation to  address an analysts' 
conference (UBS Warburg) this coming Monday, on the topic  of regulatory 
policy in Europe and where it is going. I knew nothing about the  topic at 
the time, but thought it would force me to learn.  Unfortunately  there has 
been little time to do this so far. The topic ties in with the work we  
discussed, and if acceptable to you I propose to spend the next couple of 
days  working on it under the contract, with a view not just to the 
presentation, but  to a  subsequent paper and publication. I should say that 
the conference  pays a fee, but only enough to cover travel and conference 
time and the  presentation itself, not any underlying research time. 
 
I see from press reports that there has been some  development or lack of it 
with respect to discussions on the EU directive.  I  hope to talk to Kyran on 
this and related topics, either today or tomorrow, and  maybe he has 
something that he can email me. Perhaps next week we can talk about  how to 
take this work forward, and where to aim at - either a journal like  PowerUK, 
or as a direct input into some EU process.
 
On the third topic, my ideas are embodied in the  paper on Joskow that you 
have seen.The question is how best to publicise and  apply these ideas - 
perhaps in a paper on Europe again? That is, to argue for  the importance of 
the directives in a particular respect, namely retail  competition, and to 
show how California failed to do this  adequately?
 
On now to European regulation.
Best wishes
Stephen
