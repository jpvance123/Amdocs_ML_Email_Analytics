Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Hi everybody,
 
Well, somethings didn't turn out as quite as  planned.  In case you didn't hear, our first offer on our house fell  through.  Fortunately, we already have another offer and the new closing  date is November 26.  All indications are that this one will go through so  here's the timeline...  We're leaving Houston on December 3.  We'll be  in our new house in Florida sometime between Dec 7 - 15th.  That gives us  just enough time to get settled in before the new semester starts on  January 7.
 
We've set up a hotmail account so we don't miss any  emails until our new Florida DSL account is ready to go.  You can start  using it immediately: scubadoobydoo_FL@hotmail.com     (Our panacea account will be valid through the end of  November.)  You can always use our website to get the active email  address.  Go to www.scubadoobydoo.com  and click on  "Contact Us".
 
We'll give everybody our change of address info as  soon as both home sales are officially done.  
 
Have a great Thanksgiving!
Kristi and Greg  Foster

The By-Laws are the ones we sent by fax to Barry L. ?   And yes, these are the latest that the company has.  The other question  that you have about having 2 people executing the agreements.  Yes it is  necessary that 2 of those will need to sign.  One of them will be Genaro  Larrea Mota Velazco and I believe that the other one will be Daniel Tellechea  Salido (this I will have to confirm)
 
Which is your phone number ?  I may be calling you  between the next couple of hours.

We received the power of attorney and bylaws you  emailed.  I had a Spanish

look fine. We would like you to follow  up with a certified copy in the
mail.   For now can you confirm  via a response to this email, that these
are the latest bylaws on  file?
 He noted that under the Power of Attorney, it would be  required that two

execute our agreements.  Can you  confirm?  Would be happy to discuss this

Of course I remember you.  GK is really a great spot on Fridays - Looked
like you guys were having a good time!
I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.  No
worries.  While I've never been a big fan of unconventional dating
practices (i.e. hooking up over the internet), i do fancy your approach of
straightforward and clever ingenuity!!  And if you ever want to just have
lunch or a drink anyway, let me know.

Jen

P.S.   Tell Mike "no worries"  as well!

Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight
on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had
never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of
"Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"
We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.
I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a
drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved
with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Subject:	RE: Bridgeline Partnership

Lets meet from 4:00 to 4:45 on the 5th floor of ECS.  As it stands now - we need to understand what happens under the agreements in the event that we pull LRCI into bankruptcy.

Case 1:  Do Nothing - Dow terminates lease and brine service agreement, traps gas in storage, LRCI cannot complete Enron #1, LRCI pays penalty payments to Bridgeline for not making storage capacity available, LRCI defaults under Contribution Agreement.  

Case 2: LRCI in Bankruptcy - ? 

We need to make a call.

Regards,
Brian

Probably need to include Jim Coffey on this, as his group will ultimately be responsible for the accounting for the Bridgeline investment.  I am available at 4 pm but will need to leave at 5.  Let me know if we will be able to get a meeting together today.
Thanks,

It turns about that there are conflicts with 9:30.  How about 10:30?

As you know, we are continuously updating the Foreign & Domestic Counsel database so that it can be maintained in the most accurate form; therefore, any new information you may have regarding outside counsel firms that have been interviewed and/or retained in the past month would be greatly appreciated.  Also, if you have any updates to the existing database entries we would also like to hear from you. 

Please take the time to help us update this database so it can be a valuable tool for all of us!  Each one of us has full access to the database via your Lotus Notes application at ECT_HOULN1/ECT/Legal/ECT Foreign & Domestic Counsel database. 

We are also looking for any firms that have been either interviewed or have signed an Engagement Letter with us.

Please provide any new information and/or updates either to Nony Flores or Becky Spencer. 

	      Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Gerald,

I have reviewed the agreements.  I have only one question concerning "Variance From Nomination".  If the producer under delivers and I have to replace the gas should we use a keep whole.  I am not sure if this concern is covered under "2. Quantity Obligation"  Please let me know your thoughts.

thanks JJG

Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Veroinca,

Below is some additional information regarding our conversation yesterday on MMS. There are 3 deals in Sitara that capture the deal that Nelson has done that begins November and runs through March (Deal #1103008, 1103884, 1103914). We are working with Gerald Nemec to establish a GISB to cover this deal. We are going to use the same form that was used by Enron North America. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from me.

Judy

Nelson, your current GISB is dated 1/1/2001 and is between Enron North
America Corp. and MMS.

When we scored the 2000 financials we used Enron Corp. financial statements.
We can certainly use other Enron subsidiary's financials if you want to
provide them but, if Enron North America Upstream Company LLC is the
purchaser and the only financial statements we have are Enron Corp. we would
like the parental guarantee to be from Enron Corp.


Enclosed is a guarantee that is available on our web page. You can provide
your own if that is more convenient. At a minimum, the guarantee should
cover 60 days volume at current prices and the term should go from the first
delivery date under the contract until  60 days beyond the last delivery
date. In some cases, we have had companies increase the term and value of
the guarantee so that adjustments don't have to be made for subsequent
purchases.

I know that this is additional paperwork. We are trying to streamline things
as much as we can. But, one of the things we have to deal with is making
sure we are consistent with all our purchasers. We appreciate your continued
interest in the MMS RIK program. Let me know if you have any questions. My
phone is 303-275-7224. Sorry for the long winded message. Hope you have a
good weekend.

Dear Cheryl:  I'm sending you this information to follow-up regarding our brief discussion today about the subject company.  As I mentioned, the Texas Railroad Commission still shows this company as active.  We have written to the TxRRC before saying that all the facilites and contracts for Enron Industrial Natural Gas Company were sold to HPL, but they can't "de-activate" the company yet because their records show it as "active" due to the acitvity shown by another company.  

Apparently the company that needs to file corrected P-4s showing that HPL or another company is involved in these leases is:

Devon SFS Operating, Inc.
20 N. Broadway, Suite 1500
Oklahoma City, OK  73102
Phone:  405-235-3611

The wells operated by Devon that show up in the TxRRC records are:

Gas ID 147583, Well #3, State Lease # 90621
Gas ID 147993, Well #4L, State Lease #90621
Gas ID 147996, Well #4U, State Lease #90621

I hope this information is helpful.  Thanks for helping us resolve this issue with the Texas RRC.

Best wishes,
Mary

Police, Ferentz probe incident at bar
By MEGAN MANFULL and TOM WITOSKY
Register Staff Writer
09/28/2001

Iowa City, Ia. - A criminal investigation is under way into an alleged
assault that involves at least one member of the Iowa football team.
Tom Widmer, an Iowa City police captain, said Wednesday that the
investigation began early Sunday morning after police responded to a call
from a bar named Etc. The tavern is located in the downtown Iowa City
pedestrian mall.
"It is an active investigation," Widmer said.
Widmer said police received the call about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. He declined to
identify any suspects.
Ryan Rooney, a manager at Etc., said at least one assailant was a member of
the Iowa football team. He would not identify the player or say if more than
one player was involved.
Rooney said one of his bartenders sustained a concussion from the assault
and required medical attention.
"It was more of a jumping than a fight," he said.
Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said Thursday morning he was looking into the
matter. He said he was told of the incident Wednesday evening.
"I'm fuzzy on the details right now," Ferentz said. "A player told a coach
about something that took place, and then they told me. I'm going to look
into what happened and get more details about it.
"I want to find out if anything did happen . . . then I will see if any
action needs to be taken on the team."
Iowa's season already has been marred by one violent assault. Offensive
lineman Sam Aiello attacked quarterback Jon Beutjer in July, although the
incident did not become public until the first week of the season.
Beutjer said he received a concussion, although he did not file a report
with police. He later left Iowa and enrolled at Illinois, saying he felt
betrayed by the school's handling of the incident.
Ferentz said he had not been contacted by police about the incident at Etc.
A report obtained from police says two people were injured at Etc. Rooney
said the second victim, a woman, was "shaken up pretty bad."
Kevin Prestegard, the investigating officer, confirmed Thursday the probe
was continuing, but refused further comment.
"It all depends on the police and how diligently they will pursue this,"
Rooney said. "They have a lengthy amount of time before they have to do
something. If they are season ticket holders, I wouldn't be surprised if
they wait until December."
Police declined to respond to Rooney's comment.

 procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Mr. Nemec -

This email is a follow-up to my voice message to you last week regarding the above-referenced document.  I work with Bill Mathews in the Denver office and we are preparing a compression administration agreement between Bear Paw Energy and Independent Production.  We are working off of your agreement and I was wondering if you could email me (tricia.flanigan@enron.com) the above-referenced agreement.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 720-946-3661.

Thank you,

Subject:	Malin Retructuring with CNR

 Here are the details of the CNR restructuring that is happening effective Dec 1/01.  This should reduce the amount of credit Enron has been asked to post with both PGT-NW and TCPL.

EC purch from CNR of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct08: 
Del Pt changes from NIT to Malin
price changes so EC does not collect Nova, TCPL-BC or PGE-NW toll; EC still pays to CNR 25% of PGE-NW and TCPL-BC tolls

EC sale to ENA of 15,000 mmbtu term Dec 01- Oct 08:
Del Pt changes from Kingsgate to Malin
price changes so ENA does not collect PGE-NW toll
EC does not supply PGE-NW fuel

CNR appoints EC as nomination agent on PGE-NW and TCPL-BC
CNR assigns West Gate shrinkage rights to EC

EC and ENA own renewal rights. CNRL does not.

TAGG E99896 - 10,000  mmbtu at Malin

ENA releases to CNR PGT capacity Kingsgate to Malin 10,000 mmbtu Dec01-Oct03 at full tolls
EC assigns to CNR TCPL-BC capacity ABC to Kingsgate 10,815 GJ Dec01-Oct03
EC does not assign Nova

EC purch from CNR of 10,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct 03: 
Del Pt changes from NIT to Malin
price changes so EC does not collect TCPL-BC or PGE-NW toll; still collect Nova toll
EC does not collect fuel. i.e. Fuel NIT goes to zero

EC sale to ENA of 10,000 mmbtu term Dec 01-Oct 03:
Del Pt changes from Kingsgate to Malin

Howard Sangwine and Greg Johnson are preparing confirmation amendments that should reflect the above terms.

Any questions give me a call.

Bruno,

Julie Gomez relayed your concern regarding the last sentence of Article II, Section 2(a).  I have revised the sentence as you requested.  Please forward 2 executed copies of the LOI to Julie, whereupon she  will sign and return you a fully executed version.

Thanks for your assistance. Looking forward to working with you on this matter.

So I'm here in my office compiling some production data off the shared
drive this morning and listening to a little of the Best of the D cd that
Eric was so kind to cut for me.  Of course due to the unruly nature of the
D I was using my headphones.  About 2 hours later I get a phone call and I
take off my headphones to answer it only to find that my computer speakers
were blasting the D and I couldn't tell because of the headphones.  Maybe
I'll be employing the message of the D sooner than I'd like.

Ps.  Welcome back.

Hey Geraldo,

It would be great to see Paul go far in his Navy career, the military can use
more guys of his caliber.........

I had not seen the writings on the bombs, that's great, I'm sure those guys are
motivated to do their jobs well............

Wow, that's great news about Sharon.  This is her first, right?

My sister is now engaged.  She and her fiance moved into an apartment off of
Memorial Drive.  He's an engineer (UT grad as well, civil engineering I think)
and works for Chicago Bridge & Iron.  So we are relieved she hooked up with a
good guy.  She's 27 going on 18, so yes, it's kind of wierd to see your little
sister growing up before your eyes.

We definitely need to get you out to the house.  We just had laminate wood and
tile flooring put in to part of the house, so it's a bit more presentable now.
The cheapo original carpet was getting pretty trashed.  My kids are getting big
fast, they're a lot of work but getting to be a lot of fun too.  All the talk
arouond the house is of Hallloween, they're looking forward to it.

OK bud, gotta get a presentation ready for a meeting this a.m.

Let's hook up soon,
EZ

Ernie,  I think that's right.  It makes sense since he is Chief Weapons
Officer.  Bieraugel is one smart dude.  He helped me through many an
engineering class.  Wouldn't be surprised to see Admiral Bieraugel one day.

Did you see on CNN how the Navy guys are writing "For NYPD" and "FDNY" on
the bombs being dropped in Afghan!  Eat that!!

Yep, Saturday was pretty depressing.  I have to hand it to OU.  Stoops is
an outstanding coach.  I will still go to the games, though some of the
luster is lost. How is the family doing?  My little sister Sharon had a
little boy yesterday.  William Boone.  Pretty weird when your little sister
starts having babies.  We still need to get together when we get a chance.
Let me know when you get some time.

   Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT,
   just
   lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

I have attached a draft arbitration demand our outside counsel has prepared. Please take a look and give me your thoughts. I want to make sure the facts are all true and correct.

Have we heard anything from Texaco as to their position on the testing of the Sorrento II cavern to determine the appropriate pressure? Any more settlement talks? 

We are ready, willing and able to initiate the arbitration proceedings. Let's talk at your convenience.

Dave - As I mentioned on your voice mail, Brian has authorized payment of the fire eyes and dewatering line amounts. We probably need to get an invoice from Bridgeline to pay these. Can you handle this? Let's discuss.

Will you call Gary and tell him that a draft is coming?  Also, please confirm that the September 2002 date is acceptable from your perspective.  It was on my suggestion that Gerald put it in there and I want to make sure the resident expert agrees that September is late enough to allow us to remove the pad gas if need be.

Subject:	RE: Dow Lease Amendment 

The agreement looks good from our angle - send it and lets see what Dow thinks.

UPDATE: 

I received a call from Gulf South who says that they have completed their deal with Dow to lease caverns #13 and #14, subject to receiving FERC permits.  So, Dow should be willing to let us extend the lease because they will be giving up significant value if we start withdrawing gas.  Gulf South can't buy the gas from us now, because they do not have the proper FERC permits.  We may, however, be able get them to pony up for the lease payment extension (in exchange for us not pulling the gas out of the ground).

Alternatively, Bridgeline is willing to step into our shoes and purchase the gas from us for resale to Gulf South (once GS get their permits) as long as Gulf South provides Bridgeline with a firm purchase commitment at some date in the future (independent of the FERC permitting condition precedent).

Regards,
Brian

Gerald/Debra,

There is one additional change to the amendment that you are working on for Jill Zivley for the Aspect, Helmrick & Payne, etc. contract. We need to include a MDQ of 16,000 MMBtu/day. 

Also, could you please let me know approximately how long it will take to be able to provide Jill with a draft to send to the customer? We need to get something to the customer on Monday if at all possible.

Thanks,
Judy

Debra,

Jill is ready to finalize the Aspect Amendment and send it to them today to sign.  I have editted the amendment that you provided to include the new pricing as well as the Keep Whole language.  

Please review the revised pricing section and advise if we can remove the "DRAFT" from the amendment and send it to the customer(s) to sign.

Thanks,
Judy

 Judy attached is the Aspect Amendment as discussed.   The  first paragraph has been revised to reflect the assignment to ENA.   Article 2. now states term dates.  Concerning Articles 3.1 and 3.3, Gerald would not agree to "one sentence". Finally, I  included a provision regarding changes to working interest (see # 9), and incorporated meter number on Schedule I.  Please let me know if you have any other questions and or changes.

Gerald,

Sorry for not getting back to you sooner on this.  I have sent an email to David Owen about the hazardous waste question.  I will let you know what he says.  However, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think we want to make any warranties about potential hazardous waste sources on the property.  At the most, we could make a warranty about the fact, if true, that we have never used the property in such a manner.  David Owen should be able to tell us a little more about the uses of the property.  

As far as Item #3 below is concerned, do you know if we have done a title search on the property?  If we need to do a title search, there is a guy in Louisiana that can do it for us.  If we know there is a discrepancy in the chain of title, is there a way to nullify the latest transfer between LRPC to LRCI.  

Let me know what you think.  If you think it is necessary to meet to discuss these points, please let me know.  

Thanks,

Rakhi
(x3-7871)

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

Aha!  Sorry I didn't remember sooner that Taffy sent it to me electronically.  Anyway, this should make things much easier.  Please let me know if you need anything else, I'll keep you posted on the bids.  By the way, does Enron have a preferred form of payment?  Oxy wanted to know if we wanted cash or check (?!?).  Isn't a wire transfer what we usually do?

Dear U2.Com Member,

One year on from the launch of U2.Com, we're now delighted
to launch our interactive fan-based Zootopia pages. (It is
the one element site visitors have been asking for more than
any other).

As a registered member you can now trade views with fans
worldwide about U2 albums and tours, discuss other fan sites
or wrestle over the different political and social causes
the band support. You can also chat live. As Zootopia
develops we will introduce new boards in response to your
requests.

For a trial period, Zootopia is open only to people already
registered as U2.Com members, but within weeks it will be
accessible to everyone.

When you click this link http://www.u2.com/homepage/zootopia_disclaimer.html
you will open a disclaimer and if you agree to that you can
access the new interactive area.

You will need to log in with the e-mail address that this
mail is sent to and use the password zootopia. Once logged
on you can click the preferences button and complete
additional information and choose a username and change your
password.

In other U2.Com news, we have posted the US video for Stuck
In A Moment along with the band's performance at the Video
Music Awards. And there is still time for you to cast your
weight in favour of U2 - and U2.Com - in the MTC Europe
Awards, where the band have five nominations. Make your vote
count here - http://ema.mtv.co.uk/uk/content/voting.shtml

And don't forget, we are now carrying several new items of
clothing in the U2.Com shop, introduced especially for the
third leg of Elevation 2001. Check all the gear at
http://shop.u2.com/


Best wishes

Dear Patrick:  Yesterday I spoke with the Office of Conservation at the Louisiana Dept. of Natural Resources about the Crawfish Plant.  As you may recall from our phone conversation several weeks ago, we (LRCI, Inc.) have been assessed with a civil penalty for failure to file an R6 report in July.  La. faxed me a copy of the June report, and it shows a balance of 29 barrels of oil at the plant.  We can't close out the filings with the state until the R6 report shows a balance of zero barrels.  

I've spoken with Annette Thompson in accounting, the specialist who signed the June, 2001 R6 report, and she said she's in the process of determining exactly how to report the disposition of those last 29 barrels of oil.  In the meantime, I've prepared a payment request form to go through the ipayit system for a check in the amount of $250.00, the civil penalty.  This can accompany our final filing when it's ready.  

When the check comes back for coding, should I sent it along to you for approval under your work order (WBS element) number?  Please tell me what that is so I can input the information.

Many thanks.  I'll call you when the check and final R6 form (from Annette Thompson), and the change of filing status form for the Crawfish Plant are ready.

Best wishes,
Mary

John,

Sorry, during our telephone conference yesterday I should have been more precise about these documents. I have the technical specifications in fax form but I was not able to send them yesterday. I will have clear originals by FedEx today and will fax them this afternoon and send them by overnight for delivery in your office Friday.

About the GPC/ECS contract, we are trying to determine if GPC has a claim of confidentiality that they believe would prevent ECS from disclosing some or all of the contract without their approval. ECS has no objection to producing the contract and I hope that we can get this resolved quickly.


Enjoy your weekend.

As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

Dear Enron Employees:

I am saddened to inform you that there was an explosion and fire at our Teesside power facility in England at approximately 2:40 p.m. local time.  At this point, we know that two employees have died, and at least two others have been seriously injured. The area has been evacuated and the power station is currently off-line.  The cause of the incident is not yet known.  

Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the families of those affected by this terrible incident.  

Jeff Skilling

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A	
Concerned for communities	34.5%	44.9%	10.3%	10.3%

Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:

---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Gerald,
Thanks for your comments.  I've made a few revisions (hightlighted in BLUE); in particular, I've clarified the Capital Expenditures Section 4 (we want to differentiate the transmission line from the remainder of the capital estimates).  We are still working on the items in red and in yellow.
 
One question for you in Section 8.  Why did you add the following sentence "Oakhill would maintain ownership and responsibility for all maintenance of the reciprocating gas compressors throughout the contract term"?  Its not clear to me why we'd include a sentence on gas compression.  Let me know.

Thanks, Lisa

Subject: RE: Gas Purchase and Sales Contract


I have reviewed the Keep Whole language that was given to me at our meeting
and find the following:
1.	Refer to para. (ii), next to the last sentence. The word "fail"
needs to be plural.  
2.	Please refer to the second para., 4th sentence. Seller and buyer
need to be reversed. Buyer shall pay Seller.
General Terms And Conditions
1.	Section 1, Transactions - 16th sentence, "...within ten days of
Seller's receipt...", not Buyers receipt.
2.	I understand we will eliminate the use of too many terms used to
describe the quantity. I feel the use of Baseload is sufficient.
I would like to see formal agreements (ie: Confirmation and GT&C)
incorporating the items we have discussed, including 1.) the deduction of
actual costs language 2.) Seller is responsible for all cost(s) upstream of
the delivery point and Buyer is responsible for all cost(s) downstream of
delivery point(s). Sellers right, at it's sole option, to cancel agreement
resulting from buyer's inability to move gas which is caused by Buyer's
transport. (IT or FT).
Thanks for your attention and please contact me should I be of assistance.

		I am not sure that the email that I sent to you the other
day went

resending the

		Thank you for your time yesterday. Please find Mariner's
legal input and
		my
		review of the Keep Whole language you provided me.

		Mariner Legal Comments and suggestions:

		1.	Incorporate in each confirmation, as the second
sentence of the
		last
		paragraph in the confirmation: "However, Section 2 of the
GTC shall not
		apply".

		Keep Whole Language comments:

		1.	At, ii, second to last sentence, the word fail
should be plural.
		2.	The first paragraph after (ii), fourth sentence, the
words
		"Seller
		shall pay to Buyer" needs to say "buyer shall pay to
Seller".
		3.	MMBTU needs to reflect a daily quantity unless ENA
intends it to
		be
		a monthly qty. Lets clarify what the official "Baseload
Quantity" will
		be.
		Lets discuss. Will this quantity change before the first of
each month? 

		Thanks for your attention.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.

Thanks for your help.

Greg

Gerald,

Per our earlier discussion, we need to prepare the assignment paperwork to move this contract from ENA to Upstream effective for July 1, 2001.  Please let me know if you need anything else from me in order to begin the process.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

If we don't assign the ENA Master, the confirm will need to be a GTC Dedicated Reserves confirmation.

Do we need to send out Revised Master under ENA Upstream Company LLC ?
Otherwise we have to send out a revised Confirmation under GTC.

The Stevens Oil & Gas deal (06/01/01 - 05/30/02 - Sitara # 892828)) was only entered in the system today. Mary (Terry) Franklin entered it, but under John Grass instructions they entered it under ENA Upstream Company LLC  -  we need to send out revised Confirmation.

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

Gerald, a couple of comments...
1) Pricing does not change until 1/102, nor do other provisions like the keep whole, The way you have the contracts drafted, it is as if we have new terms beginning now. I think the producers will object to this and think we are trying to put something over on them now. Can we make the new contracts effective 1/1/02?

2) Under Art. 2 Contract price....I have a questions about the 80% of "First of the Month Nomination"...what about the 5% swing they get...Shouldn't it be 80% of actuals, subject to the keep whole? Maybe I am the one confused, but could you please call me to discuss. Thanks.

Gerald,
I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.  I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.  Do you know where I might obtain a copy?  Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.  I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.


Thanks for your help.
Karen

Judy, the confirm language looks good, but the price is wrong - should be Index less .0175 for the first 1700/d and  Gas Daily flat for gas over that amount each month. We can put a MDQ if you want to...but the only way we would have more gas is if they add another well and we could reject it I think if we wanted to based on it not being w/in the dedication......Do you want to talk more about that? Thanks.

Per Jill Zivley, there is not an MDQ, but she will work with the customer on a monthly basis for volumes above 1700.  Please let me know if we need to adjust the confirm based on that information.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.

Because of the, somewhat Byzantine, transition rules under the new UCC, if
the location of the chief executive office of any party against which we
are searching was different on July 1, 2001 than it is today, I would
appreciate it if you would let me know.  Thank you.

WHAT IF SOMEONE MAKES A PHOTOCOPY OF MY TICKET?
ONLY ONE SCAN OF THE BAR CODE ON YOUR PRINTED TICKET IS ALLOWED.
Although you can make photocopies of your printed ticket, you run the risk that someone else will use
your copy, or your original.  If their copy of the ticket is scanned before yours you will need to
present the credit card that was used to make the purchase and a photo ID in order to verify that
you are the original purchaser.

Handle your printed tickets as you would valuables or cash.

1.  Send forms of agreements to counterparty as a first step to get the process moving forward.  If you do not have a contact at the counterparty call the credit hotline at 31803 and ask for Jay Williams or another credit person who can help you get the contact name and number.  Credit is working diligently to get specific legal entity names to us as well.

2.  At the end of each day send a status update, including specifics of steps taken, to me and Carol St. Clair, cc Louise Kitchen, Bill Bradford and Tanya Rohauer.  Carol and I will summarize for Louise, Bill and Tanya, but copy them in case they are interested in any particular party on an urgent basis.  Management has asked that we contact the counterparties at least each day and keep this moving to closure of each agreement as quickly as possible.

Gerald,

Can you take a look at Mariner's comments on the Confirm and GTC to see if we addressed all of their concerns in the changes that we discussed yesterday? They seem to be ok with most of the contract and only had a few comments.

Thanks,
Judy

	Barbara,

	I've included the 1st draft that Gerald emailed to me before leaving on vacation.
	The text that I've inserted is in blue.  There is some text that I've excluded relative
	to the "Start Date" because of issues that surround the commodities (gas and power)
	by not having a Firm Start Date. 

	 The concern will be what happens if the installation by ECS (or our appointee's like Hanover 
	and Rusk County Electric Cooperative) is delayed (i.e. construction risk).  My suggestion is
	to have the customer operate under the Test Period provision for the first 2 or 3 months of the
	deal and push the Start Date back.  Ultimately we are still picking a date that everyone is 
	comfortable that we can accommodate before taking financial positions with the commodities.

	 I'm open for suggestions.   

	mk

Subject:	Discussion Drafts for Oakhill and Bay Gas

Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted projects:

Bay Gas Storage
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft Lease Agreement
3.  Draft O&M Agreement

   

Oakhill
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.

  

Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks.

Gerald,

After talking with Nelson Ferries about two of his counterparties, I have found that the standard Tolerance/Keep Whole language that is now in our ENA Upstream confimation will not cover the negotiated Keep Whole for these counterparties. Nelson has negotiated a Keep Whole arrangement that takes effect whether the counterparty notifies us or not. The tolerance for their swing is 10% and the pricing is based on Gas Daily Mid. 

He has worded the Keep Whole on his deal tickets as follows:

"Volumes deliverd in excess of 10% of the FOM nom shall be prived at the applicable Gas Daily Report, Midpoint price. Volumes delivered below 10% of the FOM nom shall be kept whole at the applicable Gas Daily Mid-point up to the agreed tolerance level of 10%."

These deals are monthly deals that are done every month and will need this language in them every month.  Please let me know how you would like to handle including of this special language in the confirmations. 

Thanks,
Judy

Gerald,

Have you gotten a chance to look over the ROW document?  It seems to be a pretty standard agreement.  If possible, we would like to get this finalized soon.  Once we hit the middle of Dec, it will probably be harder to get anything done.  

Let me know if you have any questions on the agreement.

Thanks,

Rakhi

yeah, I'm a buy-and-hold kind of guy, so I can be patient for the
transition...............

I'd definitely do my best to get a pass for a game, if you ever have an opening.
Don't want to get my hopes up with the pre-season rankings, but it would be cool
to see a #1 vs #2 matchup OU weekend.

Have you heard from George?  I never got a response from the email I sent him a
few weeks ago.

I think your on solid ground.  I think the stock will stay down for a
little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the
chairman.  We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like
broadband, Dahbol,  and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.

Not much new going on.  Just hanging out.  Working.  Will be heading to
Austin for the game on Sept 1.  Let's see if the horns can live up to all
the hype.  I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will
let you know when I have an extra for the game.  See if you can't get a
hall pass from your better half.

      I probably should have picked your brain first, but I bought some
   stock today.  I think the punding you guys have taken is getting a
   little
   carried away now.  While there is uncertainty over Skilling leaving, I
   think
   your guys fundamental position is still excellent.  Can't say I bought
   enough to help turn it around, but I hope there are others who feel as I
   do.....................

      Anything new going on?  Pretty much the same ol here.  Just about to
   go into my busy planning period, Sept-Nov, so not looking forward to
   that
   much.  Kids are doing well and two of my three start pre-school next
   week,
   so mama is relieved.

      Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
   little
      early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
   good
      time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

      It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
   last
      week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
   the new
      car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
   on
      Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

      Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
   him
      since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

   to the

           Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
   getting
      into
           Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
   (281)
      772-9250.
           If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
   don't
      you just
           call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
   we'll
      ride
           over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
   seeing
      with me.
           My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
      wedding is
           at 7.

           Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

      Hotel Room Confirmation








           Gerald,

           Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
   $129
      rate.
           Below
           you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
      matters
           which
           one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
      They're both
           on
           my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

           I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
   from
      SA.  I
           estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
      right?)
           We'll
           actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
   family
      from the
           Valley will be there as well.

           If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
   at
      the
           hotel
           sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

           In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
   got
      him a
           gift
           yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

calendar.  Wouldn't miss it this time.  The next couple of weekends are
busy, so I might just wait until the No Le Hace festivals to make it to
Austin.

How is everything else going?  Have you been taking it easy at work, since

Can you change the Huber transaction agreement to reflect the pricing provisions we have laid out in the LOI.  The only other thing I saw in the Capacity release agreement was in 2.6.  If they owe us for any refunds prior to the release date, then we should owe them for any charges in the future for any past periods.

Thanks

We are trying to send out a draft version of these on Monday afternoon.


Thanks

Jay/Gerald,

This is an industrial customer I would like to sell gas to.  The deals will short term Spot transactions.  Can provide the proper clearance for short term trades.

Paul Lucci
(303) 575-6474









Dear Paul,

I spoke to you about setting up a Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement with
Holnam Cement, a direct connect end user on CIG at Portland Colorado.
Portland is located on the Canon City lateral on the CIG Valley Line.
Please verify that you have the ability to deliver gas at this location.
Then, please contact Jim Crain with Holnam to answer any creditworthiness
issues.  Jim can be reached by e-mail or by calling (719) 784-1102.

Please contact me and send any GISB Special Provisions required by Enron.

Holnam's primary fuel is coal.  Holnam will order spot gas on CIG when
starting up or shutting down its coal fuel and, if available, make spot
purchases as confirmed.  In August Holnam will need at least 75,000 Dth.  If
more is required it will be ordered.  Holnam will purchase the gas
"delivered" at Holnam or as directed by CIG for storage refill.  I will
supply you with the meter identity at Holnam when required.

Please respond immediately.  Thank you.		 Larry Campbell  (303) 239-1361

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Following up on my voicemail, attached is a revised LOI that I would like you to review before it is sent to Bruno.  Please look at Article II, Section 2(a) to see if you agree with the Breakage Fee concept and limitations.  Give me a call with any questions or comments.

Hey Dude,  How is it going?  Was thinking about maybe making a road trip
next weekend the big A.  What do you have going on?  Might just be
myself though.  Barbara and I had a parting of the ways.  Relationships
seems to give me the panics after a couple of months.  Right now I am
working on recharging the girlfriend pipeline.

Attached is my 1st draft of a Servitude agreement for the Sorrento
pipeline in Assumption, Louisiana.  I used Enron's base agreement and
made numerous changes to comply with Louisiana law, considerations not
addressed in the base agreement, clarity and good grammar.  I also
included some of the provisions of the Sorrento proposed draft. Please
call to discuss.

Today's poll from the Daily Oklahoman:

What will Mack Brown's excuse for a brutal loss to OU be this year?
 <<...OLE_Obj...>> Simms-Applewhite slap fight before game

 <<...OLE_Obj...>> Defensive coordinator spent too much time buying
umbrellas for players

 <<...OLE_Obj...>> Corso picked us

 <<...OLE_Obj...>> Officials immune to threats from 'Big Tex'

 <<...OLE_Obj...>> No excuse: We lost to the better team

Debra,

I forwarded down to you the subject several months ago. We had a conversation a few weeks ago and you advised me it had been forwarded to someone for review. I still have not seen the documents back and have been advised by OGT that we can not nominate gas on that agreement until we return it to them.

Would you be so kind to check on it.

Thanks.

Bryant

Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!  

Sincerely, 
Eva Rainer

Debra,

All of the thresholds and Mac's on the contract look good.  However, please confirm in which name the contract will be executed as, please.  I think that the contract should be executed with Atmos Energy Corporation.  In which case all of the references to Customer in the contract will have to be changed (as they all currently refer to Greeley Gas Company, a div....).  The problem is that we do term deals with Atmos as well (most of them) and if it is a division of the contract should be with Atmos and not Greeley Gas, a div.

Thanks and sorry about the delay,

Veronica

Russell, pls set up credit terms for customer for transactions under the physical, which may include pricing amemdments. i.e. the MTM risk may sit under the physical agreement.  

At this time, we are not going to pursue the execution of a deemed ISDA and any price amendments will be handled physicaly. 

Call if there are any questions.

I left you a voice mail earlier indicating I wanted to send you the attached
agreement.  The first one of these we did a long time ago was only a page
and a half.  Now we are up to 3 and a half.  Must be we have more to
protect.  Anyway, please review and if OK, make and sign two copies for our
execution.  This will help us get the right information to you.  Also
consider when it might be good to meet to discuss the project.

Gerald-
I am forwarding this Riceland Petroleum Company confirm to you per Ellen W. as it needs extra legal language in it.  You should have Riceland's August confirms that Ellen has already sent you.  This confirm is for the month of September.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gerald,

Looks good to me.  In the signature block, should it be Enron Compression Services Company as opposed to Enron Compression Company?  The information that I have on the ROW tracts is not specifically descriptive other than to describe them as tracts owned by 1) Herbert and Margaret Lane Property, 2) Alan and Elizabeth English Property and 3) Kay Arnold Fritz Property all in dispute along the Shaky Joe Swamp Transmission Line.  The attorney representing these people is Brigham Moore LLP and the representing attorney appears to be Andrew Prince Brigham.  Hopefully, this is good enough.  If you need to talk to me, call me at 701-683-4683 or leave me a voice mail at 3-7350.   When you have a draft of the Construction Cost Overage letter, please send it to me.  Thanks again for all your help and hard work.

Thanks,

Do you know who is responsible for cancelling the operating permits for HPL Compression?  Zero Gross Receipt Tax reports will have to be filed quarterly until that permit is canceled.

Stacy: 
I have attached the one page Exhibit "B" - Customer's Load that I received from Monica Padilla this morning, for incorporation into the NGSA.  Please let me know if you have any problems opening this document. 
The NSGA appears to be just about ready.  I have no further comments on the draft you sent by email this morning.  You might want to check the spacing and alignment of the Article 10 paragraphs on page 9, and eliminate the underlining for (a) and (b) of Article 11 on page 10.  We have provided ENA with the City Council authorizing resolution, and I assume you will providing a Certificate of Incumbency or similar evidence of authority for ENA (similar to that provided for the Enfolio Agreement) unless you propose some alternative. 
The Transaction Agreement also appears to be in order, with the following minor editorial changes: 
the address should be changed to City of Palo Alto, P.O. Box 10250, Palo Alto, CA 94303, Utilities Department-3rd Floor, Attn: Monica Padilla, Resource Planner
delete the period at the end of the first paragraph after the word "deliver"
change the date on page 2 from June 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001
add a period at the end of the Termination paragraph
capitalize the word "BaseLoad" in the paragraph entitled "Fixed Pricing" ; and
provide a little more space for the signature lines

Once these changes are made, please email a final version to me and Monica Padilla.  I really appreciate your efforts and kind cooperation in getting these documents finalized.  Please call if you have any questions.

Subject:	Dow Invoice

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Let me clear up this process.

Suzanne is only looking at the TPA's that are standand/model agreements which had been
pre-approved by legal.

If there are any changes to the model that has been approved, then legal will have to sign-off.

If this is unacceptable, please let me know.

We were only trying to help speed up the process.

Suzanne was not initialing as legal, but as operations rep that there were no deviations
from the model agreement.

Hope this helps.

Donna and Shane,
As I mentioned to you previously, Gerald Nemec will be handling the trading partner agreements upon my departure. His extension is  33512. As has been the practice in the past, Gerald should initial all trading partner agreements and any amendments prior to execution by a VP. I understand that Suzanne Calcagno has initialed some of these agreements without authorization from legal and while I understand she has recently received her law degree and awaits bar results, since she is not part of our legal department we would ask that you continue to abide by the procedures we have set in place to come through our legal department  until such time as Barbara Gray authorizes a different procedure. If you have any questions about that please feel free to contact Barbara Gray at ext. 36832.

Thanks and it has been a pleasure working with you!

Gerald,

Here is the Reciprocal Force Majeure language for you to review and discuss with Jeff Hodge. Please let me know if you need anything else from me.

Thanks for all of your help.

Gerald,

Maybe this is what you were looking for  -  this is the only Fixed Price Election language we use in Confirmations (only Flex Price deals).
 
Please let me know if I can help you further.

Robert,

Attached are Harry's calculated volumes for the Napoleonville Storage #1 well.
The 107 degree temperature is the equilibrium temperature of the salt and
was obtained from the temperature log conducted after the drilling of the well.

Garry,
The following information is in response to Mr. Morgan's questions, please
froward to Robert after your review and agreement.
Cavern Volume = 15,116,914 BBLs
Min. W.H. Pressure = 577 psig (based on 0.30 psi/ft gradient @ the casing
shoe)
Max. W.H. Pressure = 1626 psig (based on 0.85 psi/ft gradient @ the casing
shoe)  This pressure will be exceeded at the very end of dewatering to push
the brine back to surface, it is calculated that the pressure to finish
dewatering will be 1631 psig (w/ 65 psig of brine system back pressure).
Pad (Base)Gas = 3.53 BCF @107 deg F
Working Gas = 7.4 BCF @107 deg F
Total Gas = 10.93 BCF @107 deg F
The well diagram can be found in the Permit Application in Section 4.

Thanks,
Harry

Please start the dewatering process on July 30th.  To prepare from my
end, I need some information:

	Large table showing dewatering progress by day
	Curve showing max gas injections vs day

	Cavern parameters
		Spacial Volume in barrels
		Min wellhead pressure (0.30gradient)
		Max wellhead pressure (0.85gradient)
		Pad gas - Bcf at what temperature
		Working Gas - Bcf at what temperature
		Well diagram showing tubulars and dia/depth of hanging
string

I would like these Tuesday pm, so I can share them with others before I
leave for vacation.

Thanks.

Nelson,

Here is the latest version of the MMS Keep Whole that I have. I believe that we were waiting on the language from Gerald that tweeked their relevant gas day language.

Let me know if you need the latest version of the language that MMS provided to us with the Relevant Gas day language.

If we don't assign the ENA Master, the confirm will need to be a GTC Dedicated Reserves confirmation.

John - Can you provide the Meter Name, number and working interest?

If you are able to send somebody to Assumption Parish by the middle of next week to check the records, that will be fine.  We want the process to be cost effective, but please have some information to us by the end of next week.

Hi everybody,
 
We only have a few things left after the Flea  Market last month and we'd really rather not have to pack them!  Attached  is a list of items and asking prices.  We will consider any reasonable  offer just so we don't have to move everything to Florida with us.  If you  are interested in anything, please let us know before Monday, November 26,  otherwise the movers will box it all up.
 
We also have a few non-scuba items  left:
 
- Mexican-style hutch (the one that is underneath  our Egyptian market tapestry).  Asking $300
- Antique dresser/commode stand with mirror (it's  in the spare bedroom).  Asking $300
- Lifestep stair climbing machine. Asking  $350
 
We'll be sending out our change-of-address info as  soon as the house closings are confirmed the last week of November.
 
Best wishes and lots of fishes,
Kristi and Greg Foster

was uneventful. The Hilgert testimony was admitted as Exhibit 14 to WFEA's

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Louise,

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "Act of Sale" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).

I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding "war" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

I have copied the GTC and confirm templates for ENA Upstream Committed Reserves and Wellhead Pooling Point deals into our common drive under the O:/Global_Data/Contracts/ENA Upstream subdirectory.  I am still waiting to get a finalized version of the Point Specific GTC from Gerald.  I will copy that in the copy drive once it is finalized and approved by legal.  Gerald, can you please let me know the status on that???

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Please note that the pooling point version is the revised version provided by Gerald.

Thanks,

Gerald,

Do we have a format for producer gas that is not committed and not pool gas? (i.e. Linder cannot "commit" their gas to us because of credit reasons but the gas is still 100% ours for the month)

Thanks,
Judy

Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gerald:

    I reviewed the enclosed agreement and made several revisions.  I am
enclosing a redlined version showing my revisions for your convenience.
 My major revisions are summarized as follows:

    1.  I changed all references to "rights of way" or "easement", to
"servitude" or "sevitude of right of use".  Louisiana law does not use
the terms "easement" or "right of way".

    2.  I rearranged the last three clauses in the 1st paragraph for
clarity.

    3.  I combined the content of the 5th paragraph into the 3d paragraph.

    4.  I change the 6th paragraph slightly to strengthen the rights
retained by Grantor.

    5.  I added language to paragraph 7 to give more detail to the
process of abandonment and to strengthen the rights of the Grantor upon
abandonment.

 Please call with any questions or if you need further help with this.
 Thank you for allowing me to provide professional advice on this matter.

Keith

To All:

In our last general Wellhead Book meeting, we discussed general processes to be followed for larger gas deals going into the wellhead book.

Attached is the revised process check list for both VPP/Prepay transaction and long-term physical purchase transactions.  I have also attached a document outlining the procedures to get a new entity set up in Global Counterparty.

Please review and provide feedback/comments by Thursday, July 12, close of business.

Thanks in advance!

This is a Gas Daily call deal.  The deal is still alive and underway.  The volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that CSU has not called on any gas, lately.  Please get with Tyrell Harrison on the confirmation as this deal is still valid.

Thanks

Gentlemen,

What's happening with the above deal ? The term is 11/01/01 - 03/31/02, I can see the volume has been changed to 0 - is this only temporarily or has this deal been killed ?
We show this deal as Pending and I wanted to remind you that we have never confirmed this transaction. Please advise.

Gerald:

Attached is my draft "Purchase and Sale Agreement" based on the form
used in Texas.  The following are the major revisions which I made:

1.  I put the property description in the body of the agreement.  It is
short enough and I find this prevents problems which occasionally come
up when using Exhibits.  I also added a blank for the municipal address
of the improvements.  This is required by Louisiana law, IF the property
has an address.

2.  In paragraph "1"  and in the Act of Cash Sale, I added a reservation
of mineral rights.  If you are not concerned about this it can be taken
out.

3.  In paragraph "3"  I added language specifically waiving buyer's
claims under the Louisiana laws of Redibition  which are specific legal
warranties.

4.  I changed paragraph "5" to limit buyer's indemnity to matters
arising after the closing date.

5.  In paragraph "7"  I added a provision to allow the arbitrator to
order specific performance.  I also added provisions allowing the
parties to enforce the arbitrator's orders in court, and allowing the
parties resort to the courts for injunctive relief, if necessary.

6.  I added a provision for awarding attorney's fees in paragraph "13".

7.  I added paragraphs "12", "14", & "15" which are helpful boilerplate.

8.  I added Paragraph "16" to provide a drop dead date.  The length of
time is purely arbitrary.

Please call or e-mail me with any questions.

Would you like me to handle the closing also?

Keith

Gerald, 

Page 13 of the Sorrento ROW agmt has only one line on it "Exhibit 'B' of LRCI Grant of Servitude of Right of Use for Pipeline Agreement"

Should that be in there or can we delete that page?

(Located near Troy Grove, ILL- approx 10 Miles North of the Town of La Salle, ILL) The Com Ed substation we would like to have power delivered at is approx 7 Miles N. of the facility near the town of Mendota, ILL.  

Notes: 1) Nicor does not currently have an ILL Power service drop.(They are totally self gen.) 
           2) We would build line up to Com Ed and buy at the substation.

In addition to the interstate pipeslines, following are LDCs where we'll need proprietary file upload capability.

Tammy/Shane:

The attached file contains interstate pipelines EES does business on currently.  Once EES is moved to the new environment, we would like to have EDI capability upon launch.

If you could please initiate the TPA's accordingly and begin the testing process.  TPA's should be initiated for Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Enron Energy Marketing, Inc.  (note:  the attached spreadsheet also includes transportation contracts for most of the East Desk pipes; I am working with the desks to obtain the rest of the information needed.)

Please get with Donna if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Lisbet (5-4179)

The attached report summarizes the discussions at the subject technical conference held in D.C. on July 18 and 19.  Copies of documents referenced in the report are available on request.  Please let me know if you would like any of them.

More was accomplished at the conference than I expected.  Note that a follow-up conference is tentatively scheduled for August 28.  I think the full requirements customers have finally gotten the message that they will have to accept some defined level of service.  It was also clear that El Paso does not have sufficient capacity to serve everybody's full load all the time and they will have to, at the least, credit demand charges when they cannot serve their firm shippers, and may even be required to expand their system.

The DASH may need a legal risk rating attachment, and Gerald can draft that quickly if needed.  I hope it won't be needed, though, given that there is really nothing at risk....  Also, Dave Gorte may need to adjust it when he sees the DASH so I would begin by emailing a copy to him.

Dear Steve:  The Texas Railroad Commission doesn't have anything in its records that certain assets held by the subject company were divested to KN Processing, Inc., a subsidiary of KN Energy, Inc. on 3/31/1997.  We've tried to tell the Texas Railroad Commission that we no longer own this company, but since KN hasn't filed the proper reports for a number of wells for which it is shown to be a gas nominator and/or gas gatherer, the Commission is still looking to us to file reports like the P-5 for this entity.

Do you remember who handled the sale of this company to KN Processing, Inc.?  I don't know where to begin to do the research about this company or these wells.  

Please advise, and thanks,
Mary

Gerald,

I have been asked to review the referenced Agreement for EES Legal.  I have been informed by Shane Lakho that you participated in negotiations with Tennessee Gas, that you had signed off on the terms in Paragraphs 7 and 9 of Exhibit A, and that Tennessee Gas was not willing to engage in further negotiation.  

My instructions had been to compare the agreements to an EES-approved standard form, and to initial them if theywere substantially in compliance with the standard.  The Tennessee Gas Agreement deletes Enron's warranty disclaimer, so I pointed this out to Jim Keller.  He said to contact you and if you had no problem with it, that I should go ahead and initial the document.  Could you please advise as to whether I was correctly informed regarding your approval of the terms in the Agreement?  Thanks.

Scott L. Franck

Hey there!

Saw your brother again last night.  Where were you?  I think I have given up
on Taco Milagro.  Very nasty crowd that hangs out there now.  I say that
every week..but it's just so close to my place that it makes it easy to hang
out there and then not have far to drive home!

Anyway, sometimes your brother acknowledges me and sometimes he doesn't.
Maybe he didn't see me.

What are you up to this weekend?

Gerald,

I know that you have been busy with the Mexicana transaction, but I wanted to see how things were going on your review of the Questar and Sonoran open season docs.  The Questar open season ends tomorrow, May 31 at 5p.  The Sonoran open season closes the following day.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Phil

Armando, further to our conversations please find attached my calculation of the values we are seeing in the marketplace. The information provided is for discussions between Mexicana and ENA and is not to be distributed to any other party. 

As discussed, ENA's economics are based on a variety of assumptions including volumes ( that actually flow ), basis market, tariffs, and credit, not withstanding the paper we will be looking at executing. 

I believe Enron is your best choice in counterparties and we very much welcome the opportunity to act on your behalf as Agent in the liquidation of the transportation on El Paso.  

In summary, and as previously discussed I would like to submit a term sheet to you based on a summary of the documents and steps we will need to impliment to get this agreement in place. Here are just a few of the important doc's and potential next steps:

NEXT STEPS:
?	Mexicana needs to decided on confirm that you have chosen ENRON NORTH AMERICA to act as your AGENT. 
?	If ENRON is deemed agent then we need to "Accelerate' the steps in the documents summary.


DOCUMENTS:
?	Drafting and execution of Agency agreement  between Mexicana and ENA
?	Drafting and execution of physical confirm  to facilitate the Monthly and Daily purchases ENA will make at the border ( Topack) with Mexicana
?	Potential Deemed ISDA agreement to facilitate swaps ( to hedge spreads if so desired ).
?	ENA requires ( copy of By-Laws ), even if they are in spanish, we will need these to take next step ( we have the ability to review internally) 
?	ENA requires power of attorney documentation
?	Execution of Agency agreement between Mexicana, El Paso Natural Gas and ENA. 
?	Satisfactory credit review

?

Friends:

This Saturday, November 3, I am participating in the American Heart Walk, a 5k and 10k walk that raises money for the American Heart Association.  I am sure that all of you are very familiar with the fine work of this organization, but if you are not, here is its website:  http://www.americanheart.org/.  Moreover, most of you are likely familiar with my particular interest in heart related charities.

I am looking for sponsors and would be very grateful if you could make a donation.  Please let know as soon as possible if you can help, since I would like to collect most of the donations prior to Saturday.  Also, for you Enron types, don't forget about the Matching Gift Fund.

Thank you very much for your support.

Jim Grace

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Gerald,

Attached are my edits to the letter. Daphne will prepare a version that is
without all of the deletions and additions so it is easier to read. You can
compare the two to see exactly what I have done.

My edits are in blue. Comments are in bold blue and bracketed.

ECS may be over the barrel here and this may be the best deal that you can
get. But it isn't a deal because it is all illusory.

They agree to try to complete construction by a date certain (no recourse if
they don't) in exchange for an ECS guarantee to reimburse Gulf for an amount
that they think is fair (that is the only standard - they have no
responsibility justify and we have no ability to verify that amount).

In general, Gulf is allowed contributions in aid of construction and can
stop construction if they don't get it. If our existing agreements clearly
provide for a guaranteed term and minimum load, and those provisions are
linked to the costs of construction (so no further contribution from ECS was
contemplated in those agreements), then I think that ECS can hold them to
the deal.

We have no contract with WFEC so if the PSC decides in their favor we may
have to petition the PSC and ask that we not be financially damaged by their
decision and Gulf's incorrect representation (upon which we relied) that our
facility was in a territory that they could serve. I think (but have not
researched the point) that ECS would have standing as a customer. I believe
that the commissioners and their non lawyer staff would be sympathetic to
our situation.

However, if we agree to a capped amount of reimbursement then their may be
no issue for the PSC to decide. As of now Gulf has changed the deal on ECS.
If ECS accepts the change (unless under protest) then a court or the
commission will probably consider the matter moot. I'm not sure about the
legal effect of "signing under protest" in this context but can do some
research if you think that useful.

In any event I think that the letter should recite more of the history of
this negotiation and the early agreements or representations that are now
modified. I know our clients hate lawyers but we should try to have as clean
a record as possible if we think that we may have to seek relief. I don't
have any of the agreements at issue here and there is probably more that
should be included in the letter to give the context in which it is written
and signed.

More later. Call when you can.

Bill

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Gerald,

I found out that the provision that everyone keeps calling a ROFR is actually a shotgun bidding process.  I am interested in reading the relevant provisions of the document relating to this.  Apparently, if either party wants to sell, it must give purchase price to the other partner and then that other partner has the option to either buy or sell its interest at that price.  This provision may be unenforceable under bankruptcy law if the partner is a debtor.  Please have your assistant provide me with a copy of the partnership agreement ASAP.  Thanks very much.

Regards

Stuart

Georganne, this agreement will be executed Monday, dated as of Fri, Sept 28. I am out of the office on Monday, but by this e-mail I am asking Gerald Nemec to forward to you a copy of the executed agreement.  Will you please oversee the removal of the transportation positions from the MTM books as of Sept 30 (you mentioned Jeff Gosset?). The 3Q removal is important as Northern Border will be recognizing income as a result of the agreement.  We have already discussed (casually at last Monday's mtg) our accounting. We will probably need to discuss the Purchase Price Adjustment due ENA, as it has been negotiated and is being netted against the amounts due to Northern for the transportation capacity (we are the net payor). Generally speaking, AA may notice, if so, let me know, although clearly the acctg risks in this deal belong to Northern.

Be sure in paragraph 1 to identify how the person signing the affidavit is employed.

In the last paragraph, you state "Enron and El Paso each have a 50% share."  Which Enron are you talking about?  Enron North America Corp. or Enron Corp.  Just be precise.

Other than that it looks good to me, altough I will obviously defer to our Florida counsel re: the specifics needed to satisfy the other side.

Patrick,

While reviewing the proposed easement I found myself
making many changes to the easement.  It then occurred
to me that Ann Elizabeth has already prepared a standard
easement for situation where another company wishes
to construct a new pipeline across HPL owned property.

Perhaps you can use this standard easement agreement
(attached hereto) for the situation in Assumption Parish?

Let me know your thoughts on this agreement.  It's terms
and conditions are certainly more favorable to Enron's interests.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Let me just bring everyone up to speed on the det's of Saturday's super-def
throwdown jam:

Start time:  8 bells
Seating:  Limited
Booze available:  Cheap beer and select liquors from my personal stock
Dress code:  Shabby Sheik aka GeoWear
Address:  2735 Steel Street

So in review, if you have lawnchairs you might want to bring some along for
yard overflow seating.  As for the sauce, if you prefer a certain gourmet
beer bring it with you cause you aint gettin' it here.  Liquor and wine is
always welcomed.  The location is just down the street from Carrie Nolan's
for those of you who have been to parties at her place--those of you that
haven't, first of all your lucky, and secondly, here's where we're at:  One
street north of Alabama, west of Kirby Drive (Directly west of the Whole
foods).  The street has a canopy of trees and is lined with apartments,
were at the west end of the apartment complex, just look for the jugglers
and mimes performing outside.

Look forward to seeing all of you, at least as long as I can see.

Cheers,
Ryan

	Gerald,

	I'm struggling a bit the O&M Agreement.  I've made some changes to the draft
	you provided last week.  Let me review the basics that we need to incorporate:

	- We are contracting to provide specifically the maintenance of the electric drive train
	   I'm expecting GE to provide that support but we need to have an interface that I expect
	   to be Hanover.  

	- Hanover may bid to provide the maintenance for the gas compressor as a separate
	  process with the customer. Customer is currently expecting to perform this function 
	  themselves & call in contract resources when necessary.

	- ECS will need to reflect the cost and agreement and description of services to provide
	  us the "interface" between GE and Oakhill.

	- ECS will need to contract with GE for the maintenance services and then decide if we
	  want to assign that agreement to Hanover or carry that ourselves.  

	
	 	
	I want to have these agreements set up to be executed prior to executing with Oakhill
	and contingent on the final execution of the CSA and O&M agreements with Oakhill.

	Lets discuss as soon as possible.

	Thanks
	mk

I just spoke with Shane Lakho again regarding the Tennessee Gas TPA.  She said that it may have been your predecessor, Sandy Brayband(?), who was involved in this deal, but that the terms had been approved by ENA-Legal for ENA and ENA-Upstream.  Can you confirm this and let me know?  Thanks.

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom

Gerald, glad to hear that you had a wonderful time in China.  What cities
did you visit?  If you have any pics on the web let me know.

Austin still treating me well.  I could complain but it would not help.
Work is keeping me busy and I am entering triathlon season, helping my
brother run the restaurant and working on a new relationship.   A girl has
to keep her plate full! ;o)
What about you?  How is the law?  Dave told me about his new Colombian
connection!

Later, Patricia

Hi Pat,  Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding
occurred and my house sustained no damage.  Just spent two weeks in China
and the sights were pretty amazing.  How are things in Austin?

Tyrell,

Got your voice message last night  -  please review the attached updated Confirmation (see "OTHER" # 1 & # 6).
As you mentioned the Master might take some time to be Executed so I recommend we send this Confirmation as is.
Is Gerald Nemec the attorney working on the Master ? If he is I'll make sure he incorporates this GTC into the Master.

 
If you have any questions please give me a call.

A blonde walks into a pharmacy and asks the assistant for some 
rectum deodorant. 
The pharmacist, a little bemused, explains to the woman they 
don't sell rectum deodorant, and never have. 
Unfazed, the blonde assures the pharmacist that she has been 
buying the stuff from this store on a regular basis, and would 
like some more. 
"I'm sorry," says the pharmacist, "we don't have any." 
"But I always get it here," says the blonde. 
"Do you have the container it comes in?" asks the pharmacist 
"Yes," said the blonde, "I'll go home and get it." 
She returns with the container and hands it to the pharmacist who 
looks at it and says to her, 
"This is just a normal stick of underarm deodorant." 
Annoyed, the blonde snatches the container back and reads out 
loud from the container, 
"TO APPLY, PUSH UP BOTTOM."

Joel,

I have attached both the agreement for the ROWs and for the purchase of the 2.82 acres of the Crawfish land that Bridgeline is acquiring.  Please review and comment as necessary.  

In the meantime, I know that you have been working with Roger to finalize the actual ROWs that Bridgeline is requesting.  We can modify the ROW agreement accordingly once that has been finalized.  

Thanks for your help,

Rakhi

Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,
Judy

David,

I called our Credit Group to look into how large Enron's corporate guaranty is with the Duke pipelines (i.e. TETCO and Algonquin) to make sure that we will pass the credit check that will occur when the capacity is released to us.  Two counter-parties, ENA and ENA Upstream, are set up to do capacity release and other transport deals with Duke with a maximum guaranty of $16 million.  TETCO has ENA down for$1.7 million that has to cover three months of demand charges.  ENA has no other TETCO capacity at the present time, so there should be no problems passing TETCO's automatic credit check during the capacity release process.

Please note that for the two structures we just discussed, the capacity needs to be both recallable and reputtable.  If Yankee and Legal gets comfortable with the other features of the proposed structure, the gas sales price should also include the TETCO commodity cost reimbursement when Yankee calls on the gas and ENA elects to not re-release the capacity back to Yankee.

I will be back on Tuesday.  If you need to get me on Friday or Monday, page me at 1-877-347-3186.

Good luck on your quest,

Ruth

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

This was a deal a gave to Stacy D. on November 6, 2001, and she was suppose to give it back to me with some peaking option language.  I know everything is crazy, but I was wondering if someone could help me out.  If anything let me know if we even need to confirm this deal anymore.  I have a deal ticket and some comments.

Thanks

Here is the confirm for the peaking option deal we spoke about.  Let me know when you are at your office so I can bring up the deal ticket and terms of the deal.  Did not input the price on the fee section (# 5) because I was not sure how to put it in as a peaking option.

What does anybody want us to do about that ? Theresa - as you are in town on Thursday, it might be a good idea for us all to get together to discuss procedures...

 Sitara # 939837

 Sitara # 1019836
 Sitara # 1019854
 Sitara # 1019874

Debra,
Here is the spreadsheet for September confirms.

The green column is Mcf and the purple column is MMBtu at the wellhead.

Also, on Kennedy we are pricing her Gas Daily gas on a daily basis throughout the month so I guess we'll have to send her confirm after the month is over. (or state that the "minus number" is determined on a daily basis)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa

Gerald,

As discussed, insert the confidentiality language and print out on letterhead and initial.  We will be getting Jean's signature in the morning.  Please note the sentence add for financing extension negotiations in Section 10.a/b and see if you concur.

Gerald,
 
Three basic comments:
 
1. $500,000 as the cap.
2. Best efforts, not reasonable efforts.
3. Better integration of ECS/FGT into the construction process, not just reports.
 
When you get in, let's discuss.
 
Thanks,
Chris

Gerald,

Please review the attached denial letter for the September 10th portion of the W&T Force Majeure. I am still waiting on a copy of the confirmation to verify that we used the Enfolio Committed Reserves and what date is on it; however, the customer cited the Enron North America GISB as the governing contract. How do you want to handle these disparities?

Please advise if you have any concerns.

Thanks,
Judy

We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl

Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin?

Gerald and Roger, please see attached.  The one change that jumps out at me is the period of non-usage from 365 days to two years.  Isn't there an industry standard we should hold to?  I don't know if it's one or two years.  Otherwise, I don't have any issues with their changes, but will yield to your judgement.  
Thanks.
Also, we need to draft an invoice for the R/W.  As calculated by Roger, it is 142.12 Rods.  At $200/rod, they owe us $28,424.  Roger is verifying the $200/rod.

Gerald,
 
We would like to put in place a bilateral confidentially agreement between ECS and Ormat to discuss our Structured Horsepower Concept. In the near future, we would like to amend this agreement to discuss specific deals with Ormat that we are considering. The information for Ormat is below.

One other thing I forgot to add:  we've already discussed having templates for those CPs with changed due dates, but we are waiting to see just how many CPs request these change.  Right now it's manageable and I don't want to have a bunch more templates to have to worry about.  It's easy enough to remember to change those new GTCs we set up now, so we'll just play it by ear.  If too many CPs request these changes that it makes it difficult for us to keep track of, then we'll set up new templates accordingly.

Please give me a shout if you have any questions.

Thanks!
SBR

Cyndie,

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,
SBR

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be "Payment by wire on the 25th Day". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

Steve,

The folks at Dynegy called me Friday evening to give me their comments to the NC Projects CA.

1) The appropriate entity is Dynegy Marketing & Trade

2) In the return of confidential information section, they want to be able to either return the confidential information or destroy it and deliver a certificate to ENA of the destruction.

Can we get a revised CA out to them this afternoon?

Thanks,

Jon

	Gerald,
	Here is the Term Sheet that has been submitted to Oakhill for some time.  

	It should reflect the following:

	7000 hp ( 2 units rated at 3500 hp each)
	Hanover is expected to package, install and finance for ECS under a 10 yr contract
	ECS will basically Lease - Purchase from Hanover

	Hanover will provide all Maintenance for the contract term for a defined cost.  (I'm working the cost with Hanover)
	
	Power provider = Rusk County Electric Cooperative
	Rate structure = special structure whereby RCEC commits to term fixed T&D, fixed Generation and fixed Ancillary Services
		(EES and ENA are basically a no bid on providing the power into SWEPCO & RCEC)

Stacy and Gerald -

There are no credit concerns with respect to Frito-Lay, but I have a question surrounding the "Adequate Assurances" language.  In the "Special Provisions" document below, Item 6 states  "When reasonable grounds for insecurity of payment or title to the Gas arise".  Does this issue of "title to the Gas" suggest that the gas SUPPLIER might be forced to post adequate assurance?

As you know, we are managing capital very carefully right now, and any provisions that might give a counterparty legal right to call for collateral should be negotiated out of contracts.  Please let me know what you think about this issue.

Thanks,

JRW

Gerald & Stacy,

I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.

ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.

I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Re:  Dealing with today's uncertain business climate:  How using LRSolutions will help your legal department reduce outside counsel fees, increase legal knowledge and expertise in-house and save countless hours of time for busy in-house attorneys

As you are well aware, legal research and related knowledge activities and products are traditionally not a great source of efficiency and expertise. In-house counsel are frequently asked to provide their companies legal advice in a vast array of legal areas.  With corporate downsizing, understaffed legal departments are usually not equipped to deal with the many complex and varied legal issues that are presented on a daily basis.  Time is precious, as well, and in-house attorneys consistently find themselves hard pressed to attack these difficult legal problems with the degree of care required for thorough research and analysis.

Traditionally, corporate counsel respond by utilizing outside law firms for many research and writing projects that could have been done internally if only they possessed the knowledge, resources, and time.  Too often, these practices involve an inordinate amount of "reinventing the wheel", leading to inefficiency and burdensome expense.  Outside counsel bill at exorbitant hourly rates while utilizing inexperienced, junior associates.  The subsequent learning curve only adds to the enormous costs for corporate counsel.  Because associates lack knowledge in the fields that they research, the total number of hours that they spend tend to be excessive.  With soaring associate rates, the ultimate price for corporate counsel often reaches the upper stratosphere.  At the same time, associates are likely to miss subtle nuances in the law that can be damaging to the client.  In today's economy, it is absolutely essential for companies to reduce outside legal costs while retaining qu!
al!
ity and value.  In addition to saving costs, companies must be able to effectively manage risk in a proactive fashion, in order to avoid potential disaster.

LRSolutions is structured to maximize efficiency, value and quality. Experienced, in-house, partner-level attorneys actively manage all research -related projects, and are always available to discuss your concerns.

Only experts in the field can produce a product in the most efficient manner, without
missing crucial issues and predict ultimate cost.  Now, for a predetermined, fixed price, you can combine legal expertise with enormous cost savings.  Please see http://www.lrsolutions.com.

Our products and formats are flexible, and include multi-state surveys, detailed research memoranda on specific, complex issues, summations of law, advocacy materials such as appellate briefs and court filings, regulatory handbooks and manuals in every conceivable area of law (enabling your company to better manage risk and raise legal awareness), contract and other document drafting, settlement packages, and listings of relevant authorities.  We will always work with you to determine the format and objective that best suits your needs.  We can work with your outside counsel as part of your overall legal team, or provide an alternative to utilization of outside counsel as well as support for in-house projects.

Janie may have a market for this gas in January - She needs to know immediately what volume to sell.
 
Is the volume still 11,692 mmbtu/day or does it fluctuate each month based on price?
 
Please advise ASAP -
 
Thanks
 
Stephanie

Subject: FWD: Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

How true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that
men should take a look at their beer consumption,
considering the results of a recent analysis that
revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The
theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into
women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer
each.  It was then observed that 100% of the men
gained weight, talked excessively without making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed
to think rationally, argued over nothing,
and refused to apologize when wrong.

No further testing is planned.

Document		Signature
Act of Sale Form  	Jean Mrha/Julie Gomez

Board Resolution	Mark Haedicke
			Louise Kitchen

Corporate Guaranty	Jeff McMahon/Ray Bowen (DONE for $3 MM)

Certificate of Non-Foreign Status Stephen Douglas (DONE)

DASH 			Rick Buy/Dave Gorte
			Jean Mrha/Julie Gomez
			Mark Haedicke
			John Lavorato/Louise Kitchen
			Jeff McMahon/Ray Bowen

This DASH definitely needs a Legal Risk memo, which I have attached as a separate document.  Along with the DASH, it needs to be updated for the actual sale price (and the date was wrong--I fixed that on the attached but be sure Gerald's version has the right date) and then added on to the body of the DASH before signatures.  Gorte has already looked at this one, so we should be okay to get going on the signatures right away, though I would still start with him, just in case.  

There must be a computer glitch (!!!), because I am not able to open the Act of Sale and Board Resolution documents that Gerald forwarded.  He will, of course, provide executable copies of those documents anyway (same goes for the TB documents), but I will forward you his email and hopefully you will have better luck opening them than I did. The DASH anf the Lega Risk Memo are attached below, and I will leave copies of the Certificate of Non-Foreign Status on your desk.

Subject: Enron Greeley Contracts


Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald?  We need to get these contracts signed.
I am having problems reconciling with Thersa's invoices.  I have paid the
amount reflected on the invoices even through I did not agree for April,
May, June, and July.  I short paid the August invoice.  This is not a good
situation to be in without a contract.  I am not sure where Greeley and
Enron stand with each other especially in light of the difficulties I am
having reconciling the invoices.  
I do not want either party(Greeley or Enron) to find themselves in a
situation that would end up in arbitration.  Talking on the phone or
exchanging worksheets has not proved to be the most efficient way to settle
these differences.  Do you have any sugestions on how we can get the
contracts executed and the invoices reconciled before the deal terminates at
the end of October?   


Thanks...Robert

Thanks for the e-mail.  Same to you for the information provided to Eric in the meantime.  We are having our legal prepare a CA and will coordinate with Mark and Mike to make sure that it adequately covers what we are all trying to do.  Mark/Mike, I will call you later today to discuss our collective strategy and get your input on the CA.  Let me know if you need anything else at this point in time.

Chris,

I spoke with Eric yesterday and he said that you did a great sales job and he wants to try to work with Enron.  He is marketing his gas through John Bower of Natural Gas Associates.  No one here is too impressed with NGA and have visited with them before on behalf of other clients but will meet with John this afternoon to discuss Black Diamond's needs.  From Eric it sounds like they want gas purchases in addition to other physical services.  If that is the case we will bring Mark Whitt's group in on the deal.  I will keep you informed as to the progress.  Mike Legler will likely be taking the lead of this after today.  Thanks for your efforts!  James

Debra,
We are only showing that 4 producers need renegotiation letters:  Kennedy and MTG (notice by Nov. 1) and Quantum and Coleman (notice by October 1).  These are based off of the "Initial Pricing" term which was 2 years from "In service date" (Dec. 1, 1999).

I show Wellstar and Phillips (Petrogulf) are expiring in Dec. 02 and Independent expires Dec. 03.

Also, I noticed you set up the Phillips agreement as Petrogulf. Do you have the assignments from Petrogulf to Phillips?  I can fax those to you if you need them.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
Theresa

(I'll take a look at the September confirms by this afternoon.)

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 "This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000," says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  "We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities."

GasMarktFax Stirs "Trouble" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  "Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs," said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  "However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice," Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland," declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland," adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible."

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: "We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices."

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

We'd like you to fill out this survey about Enron's Corporate Internal Communications programs.  Why?  Because our job is to advance your job by providing internal communications tools and information that will help you work more effectively.  And don't worry.  The survey is confidential.

How can you be assured that completing this survey is not a waste of your time?

1.  We will post all of the numerical results on Enron's corporate intranet.  (Probably not the individual comments, though, because that would be way too much to read!)

2.  Our programs are based on what you want, so we need your feedback to assess how we're meeting your needs and where we can make improvements.

The survey will only take you about ten minutes or less, honest.  Thanks for participating.

Please place Michael Schuh by RWE and Raoul Saxena by J Aron instead of me as I am only acting as a Houston resource to Michael and Raoul as necessary. They are handling the negotiations. You should also add them to the distribution list. Thanks.

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

Could you send me the latest version of the Kennedy Proposal/Contract?  Mark said you sent it to him yesterday afternoon, but he is out today.

Thanks,

Gerald,

Here is another GTC Dedicated Reserves confirm that needs preparing. Here is the well information:

Field/County/State:	? /West Delta/Louisiana, Timbalier Bay/ LaFourche/Louisiana, ?/South Pass (South)/Louisiana
Well Name:		West Delta #35 Subsea, So Timbalier Bay 21, South Pass #78 Dehyd 
Meter No./Pipeline:	011413, 010442, 011492/ Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Working Interest:	100%

I am waiting on a call back with the field names for the West Delta and the South Pass wells.

Can we prepare the dedicated reserves confirms with just a delivery point or do we have to list all of the wells behind the delivery point?  

Thanks,
Judy

HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net
REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     Legal research often comes in waves, but as night follows day, that onerous monthly commitment to West or Lexis is always there. But with so many new options, it doesn't have to be this way.


--VIABLE ALTERNATIVES ABOUND

     True though it may be that your West or Lexis rep is out to put you on that fat annual contract, both companies offer a variety of online alternatives. A person can:

----log in and buy most any document for a few bucks
----Shepardize or Keycite for around $4
----subscribe to KeyCite for $35 a month
----rent a state for a week for $40
----conduct transaction based case law searches only when you have to
----Supreme Court case law from 1790 is now available on the web for FREE
----California state case law from 1934 is now available on the web for FREE
----the landscape continues to change rapidly


--CHOOSE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE JOB

     There can be no question that the commercial value of proprietary legal research resources will continue to drop as more and more primary and secondary materials migrate online. At TheLaw.net Corporation we advocate choosing the right tool for the job. And one of the best single tools you can own these days is our flagship software solution, TheLaw.net Professional Legal Browser.


--LESS THAN $1 A DAY FOR EVERYTHING, UNLIMITED ACCESS

     For just $395 annually for an individual, TheLaw.net gives you a remarkable foundation of primary and secondary resources, on an unlimited use basis, with a national scope, including, but certainly not limited to, the following:

----A great proprietary, searchable case law database that includes the U.S. Supreme Court, the 13 Federal circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and intermediate appellate courts. See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

----Literally millions of searchable cases, updated four times daily, offered on an unlimited use basis

----Streamlined access to:
------Federal and state statutes, rules and regulations
------the CFR and Federal Register
------executive agency databases and bill trackers
------nearly 1,000 news resources
------another 1,000 reference desk tools
------nearly 10,000 practice area helpers and much, much more
------over 50,000 documents and databases
------all just a fast click or two away on your desktop 24 - 7 - 365


--THELAW.NET MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL YOU NEED

     Depending on size, practice area and/or jurisdiction, TheLaw.net may well have everything you need. If not, West and Lexis are available online, a la carte for those times when you really need them. As an example, TheLaw.net is not yet a great resource for Federal District Court opinions.

     It all depends on what you want your life to look like. If the convenience and elegance of the gold standard is worth the rates charged by the legal research cartel, you should keep doing what you've been doing and renew that annual contract with Company A or Company B. If not, and you feel like you continue to get hammered at a time when given the efficiencies of computerized distribution of data, prices ought to be dropping, we can help. Our number is toll free: 1.877.4.LAWNET [877.452.9638] or see us on the web at: http://www.thelaw.net

I think that you told me that you did not work on the PB-KBB contract.  Might you know who did.  Gary Wilson thought it was you.  It is imperative that we find these agreements so that we can make the appropriate recommendation to the cash committee.

I got a phone call from Gary Wilson and he told me that the PB-KBB contract was with ENA and not the partnership.  This was to be part of ENA's contribution to the partnership.  He told me that Gerald Nemec was the responsible attorney or knew where the contract is.  (Is Gerald Still here?)

I'm still waiting for a phone call from Dave Owen on the other invoices.  This was all his stuff.

Hey Gerald!

I finally got my computer back up.  The name of the utility is Powder River Energy Corporation - A Touchstone Energy Cooperative (I don't know if you need that last part or not).  The relationship is this:

ECS is acting as the agent on behalf of Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC to purchase power and deliver shaft horsepower.  We will be buying electricity strictly off of PRECORP's tariff.  We will also be providing the cash for PRE to build transmission to the compressor site.  Right now, the deal term is for 10 years, starting in May '02, but we will begin negotiations with them immediately.  

Last week I met with three people from PRECORP, just to begin the relationship, one of which was Clarence Moshier (Chief Operating Officer for PRECORP), who I spoke to again yesterday.  He said that they would have no problem signing a CA with us.  Basically, I just want to make sure that whatever we put in place with PRECORP cannot be relayed to Crestone by them.

Anything else you need?

Andrew

Gerald,

Have you had time to work on developing the GTC Firm Point based confirmation for the deals that are bought at a point but are not Committed Reserves (i.e. Month-long wellhead deals)?  The Global Contracts group would like to get a copy of even a rough form so that they can make sure that the Global contracts template is set up and functioning before bid week is upon us again.

Thanks,
Judy

G,

How was the trip to Longhorn Country?  Hawks won big.  We might have a
decent team this year.

Do I have any mail over at your place?  I was expecting something from W.

Hi Jason and Veronica,

I have left messages with both of you regarding negotiations with Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  Basically, they sent us language limiting any recourse that ENA Upstream might have against the personal assets of any partner, officer, director, employee, or stockholder of Tenaska.  We need to determine whether the company is secure enough for us to agree to this provision.  This is the only thing preventing us from signing this agreement and they are anxious to get it executed.  Please let me know as soon as is reasonably feasible.

Thanks,

Alisha

Gerald, 

Did you hear anything from Keith Daigle regarding the title search?  In his last email, he indicated that it would be completed last Wednesday.  Has Kyle Purvis gotten back to you regarding the hazardous waste sources issue?  Hopefully, we can finalize these documents soon.  The guys from Assumption Parish are very anxious to get this deal closed quickly.

FYI...regarding the Sorrento ROWs with Enterprise Products, the money should be transferred this morning and the documents fully executed by this afternoon.  

Talk to you soon,

Rakhi

Keith,  Please revise the document to reflect Item 1 below.  With respect to Item 2, our environmental group is reviewing Enron's use of the property.  No such uses should be found.  What specifically are they looking for with respect to this item.  Finally, any word on the title check with respect to item #3.

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

	We've incorporated a few new concepts:
		- we have a "date certain" for our deal to start

Hey Gerald!!  The weekend was good.  I went to a wedding on Saturday, but I
was bored almost all day Sunday.  My boyfriend and I finally went to
Teala's (Houston's answer to Baby A's) for Ritas.  If you've never tried it
- Mango would be my recommendation.  Sorry I missed you and your friends on
Thursday.  I wimped out Thursday and Friday - pretty pathetic.  But I give
you props just for considering GK 2 weeks in a row!!  Did you do anything
fun?

Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything exciting?  I was
invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday night, but I thought
that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I begged off.

Judy,  Attached is the form of Master Firm Agreement for ENA and ENA Upstream.  Could you please fill in the Notice Info for ENA Upstream.  Thought it would probably be the same as ENA, but didn't want to assume that.  Once you return to me, I will prepare two executables for signature.  Thanks.

TheStreet.com - Wrong!
Enron's Excuses Sound Familiar


Telling us its shady dealings were sanctioned by outside professionals only compounds the error. 

By James J. Cramer 


This article was originally published Oct. 23, 2001. 

	

If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? 

That's what Enron (NYSE: ENE <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ene&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/e/ene.html>) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, it has simply compounded the error. Next it will tell us that Janus , the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! 

What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. 

Nope. 

What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. 

Enron didn't use taxpayers' money, so the case is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. 

We don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. 

In the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one's gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does.

Volunteers Needed to Help With a New Project
Junior Judges

Junior Judges:  Helping Kids Make Smart Choicesis a public service project implemented through a curriculum and an accompanying video, hosted by two teenagers, that depicts elementary school aged students faced with challenging decisions.  The project includes seven units and addresses the subjects that affect the lives of the target audience, fourth grade students, including: cheating, destroying property, bullying, teasing, stealing, gangs/weapons, and drugs/alcohol.  Each unit in the curriculum is self-contained so that an educator may use one, all, or just a few of the units, depending on his or her preference and time.  Attorney involvement will include explaining the importance and necessity of laws and rules in society, and moderating the topic discussions following all or some of the video segments.  
Please contact Kent Altsuler at kaltsuler@jw.com if you are interested in volunteering.
 

Volunteers Needed to Help
ADOPT AN ANGEL

For over ten years, the Adopt-an-Angel Program has provided a healthy dose of holiday cheer to over 500 underprivileged students who attend Grimes Elementary School. Children who otherwise would probably not receive gifts during the holidays are presented with clothing and toys donated by Houston lawyers and their staffs. Adopt-an-Angel committee members spend countless hours during a busy time of the year coordinating this impressive endeavor.
Each year, committee members ask every student at Grimes to fill out a "wish list." Although toys are always a favorite, most of the children also list basic clothing items (like socks and underwear) and school supplies. As soon as the committee members receive the lists from the school, they distribute them to attorneys and their staffs who purchase the items and wrap them for delivery. A few days before the students begin their holiday break, the committee members, with the assistance of Santa Claus, deliver the gifts to the children. The children are always delighted by this annual visit. 
In recent years, the Adopt-an-Angel program has been so successful that resources have been used to provide holiday meals and extra clothing to families in particular need, to purchase school uniforms for almost 100 students, and to assist with gifts to a local foster care facility.
Please contact Kristin Tassin at kristin@drylaw.com if you are interested in helping.

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

Gerald:

I am attaching the draft "Filing Form" of the Servitude Agreement with
my changes in red-line.

Because of some of the wording the Filing Form I had to make some
changes to the Servitude Agreement itself.  A red-lined draft of that
Agreement is also attached.

Please call with any questions.

We now have a fully executed Master Firm Purchase/Sale contract between ENA and ENA Upstream. I am forwarding the originals to Gerald Nemec, and he will get a copy sent to you. The confirmation language states that "Any Transaction may be formed and effectuated (i) by a written paper-based Transaction Agreement executed by the Parties...or (ii) in a recorded telephone conversation between the Parties..." Therefore, per Gerald, we can discontinue preparing paper confirmations between the two Enron entities.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Judy

Chuck -

As we discusssed, attached is a marked version of the Participation Agreement which I have marked with some comments.  Though I understand that we have existing agreements with ICE that were pretty much unchanged I was not involved in the original discussions relating to these agreements.  I also understand the message you left relating to the reluctance of ICE to modify the agreement.  I only ask that you review the attached and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks for the cooperation and time.

Mark

Sounds cool.  My mom gave me her guitar a few months ago so I bought a
fingering chart book (if that's what it's called - i don't know) yesterday.
Learning guitar - This is my new project.  How long have you been playing?

Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I stayed
home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He plays
the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or at least
we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I went
furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got kinda of sick
of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so pathetic
when people visit.

Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango margarita
though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

Debra,

I started to review the above-referenced GISB sent by you to Jeff Spector on
April 5, 2001, and realized that we already have a GISB in place between
NSP-MN and Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  Is it necessary to prepare
another GISB with the Enron North America entity, or can there be an
assignment of the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Agmt.  Please advise.

In addition, I called you earlier this week and left a message concerning
the Transaction confirmations you recently prepared for Public Service
Company of Colorado and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power, which utilized the
Enfolio General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement.  Our preference
would be to instead structure these Transactions under GISB Agreements with
each of these utilities.  Please advise if this is acceptable and, if so, I
will prepare GISB Agreements, along with our Special Provisions page, and
send them to you for review.

I look forward to your reply.

Alan Bransgrove
Manager, Contract Administration

p.s.  I will be out of the office during the week of August 12th, but will
check my voice mail periodically.

As a point in clarification, in Section 2(a) of the Master Netting Agreement the parenthetical "(including automatic termination, if applicable)" should be deleted.  Here are the new forms with the deletion made in them.  Since the form is amending the underlyings to not include automatic termination, the parenthetical should no longer be included.

    

Further, see the attached once again revised process (hopefully this will be the last revision for a time!).  Changes are in bold and deal with the gas receivables financing and credit sign-off.  To the extent a counterparty will agree to a 25th of the month effective date, do so, as it fits our physical gas billing cycle and makes it easier to pull out the receivable from the gas receivable financing.

One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Se=
rvices (EWS) manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights.  This is par=
ticularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous com=
modity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of wh=
ich may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This=
 complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliat=
ed entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual s=
etoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master =
contracts.

=09A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that =
will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with w=
hom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set fort=
h below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negoti=
ating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff l=
anguage be added.


MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR=20
EWS TRADING CONTRACTS

=09(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination D=
ate, the Non-Defaulting Party ("X") may, at its option and in its discretio=
n, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party ("Y") by X or a=
ny Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), ins=
trument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affi=
liates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) =
or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in resp=
ect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent =
of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y not=
ice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after =
the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not =
affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, "Owed"=
 shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless o=
f whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Term=
ination Date.  =09

=09Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be conver=
ted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at t=
he rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good f=
aith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being c=
onverted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate t=
hat obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the releva=
nt party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothi=
ng in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other securit=
y interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff pr=
ovision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, =
netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other righ=
t to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operatio=
n of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknow=
ledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of =
the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties =
would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further ackno=
wledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as princip=
al and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affilia=
tes, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and oth=
erwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as=
 it relates to Section ___.

=09(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agre=
ement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Default=
ing Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receiv=
es confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may =
include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind w=
hatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaultin=
g Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other ag=
reement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early=
 Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

=09This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts du=
e and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future p=
ayments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular se=
toff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language ha=
s been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. l=
aws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group =
will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdic=
tion in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, =
prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be require=
d to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other=
 than Events of Default (e.g. "Affected Party" under ISDA).  Finally, when =
incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aw=
are that this language is not intended to override the payment netting term=
s (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (app=
licable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should =
remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add=
 setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff la=
nguage into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determ=
ine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that wi=
ll need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist a=
ll lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of=
 preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutua=
lly beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be=
 able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distribut=
ed shortly.

=09If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-6544 or Elizabet=
h Sager at 713-853-6349.

Gerald and Judy,

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.
Lisa  5 4766

Sex in Florida
A couple, both  age 78, went to a sex therapist's office. The doctor asked,
"What can I do  for you?"
The man said, "Will you watch us have sexual intercourse?" The  doctor looked
puzzled, but agreed.
When the couple finished, the  doctor said, "There's nothing wrong with the
way you have intercourse," and  charged them $50.  This happened several
weeks in a row. The couple  would make an appointment, have intercourse with
no problems, pay the doctor,  then leave.
Finally the doctor asked, "Just exactly what are you trying  to find out?"
The old man said, "We're not trying to find out anything.  She's married and
we can't go to her house. I'm married and we can't go to my  house. The
Holiday Inn charges $90. The Hilton charges $108. We do it here  for $50, and

Gerald,

The name of the guy in Lafayette, LA who can do a title search for us if we need him to is Art LeBlanc, (337) 233-9099.  However you would like to handle it is fine with me. 

Like I mentioned on the phone, Roger Westbrook is the one helping with the ROWs that Bridgeline is requesting on the Crawfish land.  He indicated some time back that he had received some of the drawings from Bridgeline.  If needed, I can set up a meeting with Roger once we know the status of the documents.  

Let me know if there is anything I can do to help on either of these.

Thanks,

Rakhi

Mark,

Based on your voicemail week before last, ICE is not willing to negotiate the contract, and we will have to execute their contract as is. Have we made anymore progress with getting the ICE contract executed?

Thanks,

Chuck -

As we discusssed, attached is a marked version of the Participation Agreement which I have marked with some comments.  Though I understand that we have existing agreements with ICE that were pretty much unchanged I was not involved in the original discussions relating to these agreements.  I also understand the message you left relating to the reluctance of ICE to modify the agreement.  I only ask that you review the attached and let me know your thoughts.

Thanks for the cooperation and time.

Mark

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

This CA is to cover a proposed transaction for delivered natural gas supply via existing infrastructure to a facility under development by Cogentrix.  I modeled the CA after the Peoples CA.  Let me know if this satisfies ENA's legal needs.

Do we have a format for producer gas that is not committed and not pool gas? (i.e. Linder cannot "commit" their gas to us because of credit reasons but the gas is still 100% ours for the month)

Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions.

I am researching several outstanding receivables from Bridgeline.  I am looking for the Schedules to Contribution Agreement, which is item 3 in the index of documents.  Do you know where I might obtain a copy?  Also, is there any type of brief available on these contracts.  I have seen one for ECS, so I was hoping that one might be available for Bridgeline.


Thanks for your help.

Gerald, our group for service contracts are still in tact.

Linda Harris, at 345-6488 or Jane Scelzo at 345-6489 can help you with this one...I think.  I do not see it listed, but it could be something pending.

Linda and Jane, he thinks one of the entities in ETS might have a contract for some work that's being done in the Gulf Coast Region.  Could it be an EE&CC contract?  Gerald will be calling one or both of you for your assistance.

Thanks.

Jeff and Gerald,

I wanted you both to have the following information: (i) the legal/regulatory research questions that the Upstream Storage Group (Paul Bieniawski, Miguel Vasquez & Eva Rainer) have posed to LeBoeuf Lamb (law firm) and Brown Williams (rate consultant) and (ii) the two Reports produced in response to such questions.  The Reports were delivered to the Storage Group personnel Friday, July 27, 2001, and were forwarded to me by Bob Neustaedter last Friday, August 3, 2001.  

The cost of this work was borne jointly by Jean Mrha's Upstream Group and the Regulatory Affairs Group; Donna Fulton, Sarah Novosel, and Bob Neustaedter are the Regulatory/Governmental Affairs individuals involved in retaining Brown Williams and in recommending Larry Acker at LeBoeuf to conduct the legal/regulatory research.  I reviewed the engagement letters on behalf of the Regulatory Affairs Department.  The combined cost of these reports is about $100,000.

I've done the best I can to be sure that the Upstream Storage Group does not "overlook" the Legal Department as it forges ahead into a transactional arena fraught with significant regulatory and accounting risks and traps.  Gerald, as you have become involved with the development scenarios that involve a compression component, I think it would be wise to become familiar with the contents of both the LeBoeuf Lamb and Brown Williams Reports.

If either of you would like to discuss the legal, regulatory or political implications of the attached, please feel free to give me a call.

Steve

THIRD request!  Many of you haven't granted calendar access rights to our Legal Dept. Temporary IDs.  The temporaries that fill in for our Assistants need this access not only to set up meetings and keep your calendars current, but to refer to in case there's an emergency and you need to be found.

Assistants:  It is helpful if you block the time on your bosses' calendars for their vacations and trips.  That way when we call up the calendars the temps won't have to guess how to answer their calls.   ("I don't know where they are" is not an acceptable answer!)

Please follow the instructions below. 

For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Gerald,

Our landlord here in Denver (Equity Office) is requesting a formal notice of "Enron North America, Corp."'s name change from "Enron Capital and Trade Resources".  Apparently, on our lease, it says "Enron Capital and Trade Resources", but in the 3rd Amendment, it reads "Enron North America, Corp".  Equity says they need a copy of what was sent in for the official name change.  I'm not sure if you have something we can give them???  Please let me know.

I appreciate your help,
Thank you,

Heidi DuBose

I am a member of the  Houston Bar Association -- Minority Opportunities in the Legal Profession  Committee.  One of the programs we sponsor is a first-year law student  internship program.   This committee meets with the students at all of  the law schools in Houston and asks them to submit their resumes.  We then  provide copies of the resumes to prospective employers for review.  The  employer then selects the students they would like to interview.   
 
Some employers have  the students participate in their permanent hiring programs.  Others  provide this simply as a learning experience for the students.  The  employer determines the length of the internship and the compensation.  Six  weeks is a common period.  This is a great program which has provided  valuable experience to a large number of students for many years.  If your  organization would be interested in participating in this program, or if you  would like more information, please e-mail me or call me.  I appreciate  your consideration of this matter.   (Please feel free to forward this  e-mail to the appropriate person(s) in your organization.)

Eric,

Would you please prepare a memo regarding PB-KBB and the work that they are doing.  The memo should include scope of work, amount currently owed, amount to be spend from now until completion and the substance of the conversation that took place today.  I am not looking for a novel but rather something that is concise and can be taken to Don and the cash committee for approval.  I will take what you put together and add some information regarding the importance of getting approval for this contract given our need to complete Cavern #1 in order to satisfy our obligations under the Bridgeline agreements.  Thanks

Thanks for the address.  I emailed Paul shortly after he emailed us, and it
seemed to get through.  But I haven't sent anything lately.  Gotta keep that

Houston.

Hey E,  Good to hear from you again.  Not much new around here.  Working

email is gtownsend@manorisd.net.  I haven't played any golf recently, but
do like to play.  I am pretty horrible, but it is fun nonetheless.  I would
definetly be up for a round some time. Let me know.

Have you been able to email Bieraugel at the last address he sent?  I have
tried, but my emails keep getting bounced back to me.

      Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a

      early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
   good
      time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

      It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
   last
      week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
   the new
      car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
   on
      Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

      Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
   him
      since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

           If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why

           call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,

      with me.
           My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
      wedding is
           at 7.

           Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

      Hotel Room Confirmation








           Gerald,

           Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
   $129
      rate.
           Below
           you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
      matters
           which
           one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
      They're both
           on
           my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

           I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
   from
      SA.  I
           estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
      right?)
           We'll
           actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
   family
      from the
           Valley will be there as well.

           If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
   at
      the
           hotel
           sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

           In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
   got
      him a
           gift
           yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Gerald,

I just finished visiting with Mark Knippa about Enron Compression Services.  It probably makes sense to get together with you and someone on the bankruptcy team to talk about how we should handle all of the deals in ECS.  Can we set something up for Wednesday?  I have asked Mark to put together deal structure charts and explanations so that we have something to present to the bankruptcy lawyers for consideration at this meeting.  I would ask that you work with him to verify the accuracy of those charts/explanations.

Stuart

Maureen,

I think that Janel Guerrero and Gerald Nemec might be getting into Myrtle Beach,SC around that time.  I have cc'd them on this email so you guys can start a dialogue about getting to Ocean Isle, NC in one car.

Good Morning Brucie! I have a quick question, do you know if anyone is arriving in Myrtle Beach on Friday around 4:30? If anyone arrives around that time, maybe we can share a ride somehow. Vicki and Dennis are flying into Charleston the night before and offered to pick me up on the way but I don't want to incovienice them if I don't have to. Have a good day, Maureen

Leslie, I am not sure of who is handling this from the accounting side and who is the commercial expert on the "cash out protocol, but by copying this letter to Jim, I am requesting that he determine who is the commercial point person. Gerald and I can work together to determine whether the legal provisions of the cash out agreements are adequate as between third parties and Enron......concerns  have also been expressed by Brian Redmond about whether AEP will only try to settle those cash out situations where Enron is the obligor as opposed to both sides of the equation. I request that Jim set up a meeting with the appropriate persons and distribute the cash out protocol for discussion of the "larger picture on cash out management".

Best regards bng

AEP/HPL forwarded to our attention cash out letters to resolve third party imbalances that were incurred when HPL was a subsidiary of Enron Corp.  My supervisor, Rita Wynne, asked that I forward the letters to Gerald Nemec for his review, but he is unfamiliar with the AEP/Enron settlement and said it might be better for you to review them to make sure the language agrees with the settlement.  May I forward these to you?

Dear Mr. Hilgert,

You have been working with Bob Kannor and Kurt Bell to put an agreement in
place between POWER Engineers and Enron Compression Services Company.  They
have enlisted my assistance to propose a modified agreement to you for
review.  Please find attached, the document you provided to us, which has
been modified with the Word revision tool.

Please review our suggested modifications and provide your comments.  We are
seeking to execute an agreement that allows us to properly manage our
exposures, while providing to you prompt, professional services which meet,
and hopefully exceed, your expectations.  If you have any questions or
concerns about any of the modifications, please call me at the phone number
below.  I know that both Kurt and Bob are anxious to get the contractual
arrangements completed so that they can begin reviewing your project needs,
so they may be contacting you in the next day or so to review.

Thank you for the opportunity to propose these modifications and we look
forward to a productive relationship with your firm.

As we discussed, we need to take the most recent invoice from PB-KBB (the contractor that is responsible for injection of gas into Napoleonville) and have them bifurcate the bill into pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy amounts (using 12/2 as the date of bankruptcy).  In the meantime, please prepare a Cash Use Request Form for the post-bankruptcy amount (Doug Sewell can assist you on this) for consideration by the Cash Committee.  [CHIP PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION]

Also, please forward Gerald's draft of new agreement to PB-KBB for their consideration along with any proposed changes to the scope of work description.

Gerald,
 
Thanks for looking at this for us.  When do you think you will have a chance to review it?  I talked to the customer today - they are looking at doing some 2002 and 2003 transactions.  Also, do we need to have credit re-review?  Let me know what you need from me (us) and if I can help in any way.
 
Thanks,
 
Kim

Dave the following are PNM's Wholesale Power Marketing's comments: 

1)  Please spell out "Public Service Company of New Mexico Wholesale Power Marketing 
     throughout the Enfolio. 

2)  Section 2.3 should also include your customer's recording equipment and tape as well. 

3)  Section 4.1 (iv) ...apply to any "Party" ... should be capitalized. 

4)  Section 4.1 "last sentence"  ...Notify Party or "its" Affiliates.... 

5)  Section 4.4, please include the following sentence at the end: 

Provided, however, that it is not the purpose of this Section 4.4 to provide for or to permit the 
setoff of obligations by ENRON against Counterparty for obligations of the PNM Gas Services 
under contracts between ENRON and the PNM Gas Services or against the PNM Gas Services 
for the obligations of the Counterparty under this Master Agreement. 

6)  Section 6.2 A. first sentence "....and (iii) such New Tax is due ..." remove comma (,) 

7)  Section 8.3 & 8.5, Appendix 1: Arbitration, Disputes, Procedures and Award , Texas Law

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Subject:	New counterparty request form (deal 901255)

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Per Carol St. Clair, at this time, there is no urgency in finalizing and executing any master netting agreements.  No master netting agreement should be signed without Bill Bradford's or Louise Kitchen's prior approval.  If any questions, please contact either Carol or Elizabeth Sager.

Thanks!

Marie

Lisa,

I have worked through all of the issues and questions that Mariner had on our Keep Whole language. They are ready to see our official confirmation.  Please prepare the confirmation with the attached documents. Gerald Nemec had prepared the language in these documents specifically for this counterparty.

e-mail from mattie....

Labor Day weekend . . .
I'm up for whatever you, Jenn, Jeff, Clarke . . . and Gerald, of course . .
.  want to do.  I'll go to bars, parks, concerts, rodeos, restaurants,
beaches, museums and/or just stay at your house.  Whatever.  I can't imagine
that anything you guys want to do would be something that I would be against
doing.  And, if it is then I'll just have something to give you shite about
for the rest of your life.

The Flight:
Northwest Airlines flight #0198 from Minneapolis . . . arrives Thurs Aug 30
@ 4:15 p.m.
Northwest Airlines flight #1277 departs Houston Mon Sept 3 @ 1:05 p.m.

I believe it is a Northwest flight -- not a Continental connection.  The
website and my e-ticket say nothing about Continental.

Again, if providing a ride from/to the airport at those times presents a
problem because of traffic and/or your jobs I don't mind taking a cab --
just let me know.  If no one is around on Friday because you're at work
that's no big deal either -- you don't need to make special arrangements for
me.

Continental Cozumel 2002 vacation pricing is supposed to available on the
web beginning Wednesday I think.  FYI.

I'll be leaving here early today as the Bud Tent awaits me at the Fair.  Oh,
my -- I'm thirsty & hungry.

Here is an update on Oakhill power sourcing:

      Wholesale Generation + Ancillaries
?	Electric cooperatives and municipalities are exempt from retail deregulation.  We can not directly contract with AEP or whoever the wholesale generation provider would be because it constitutes a retail sale in a non-deregulated area.  The prevailing utility in the area must be the buyer of the power.
?	Generation + ancillaries will be provided by the chosen entity, through NTEC, and then through Rusk.  The wholesale generation + ancillaries contract will be a three party agreement between AEP (or whoever is chosen), NTEC, and Rusk.
?	Swing - There are consumption penalties for using more or less than the contracted 5.0 MW 7x24 block (meaning there is no free swing).  These penalties are part of the ancillary services, which means that we will not have the exact specifications until Rusk receives the bids on their RFP on 6/27/01.

T&D
?	T&D is provided directly by Rusk County Electric Co-Op.
?	NTEC is charging us $0.20 / MW as an administrative fee (mark up), which is why the fixed T&D cost from Rusk County is $10.20/MW and not $10.00/MW.
?	There will be a minimum T&D charge from Rusk, above which we pay for only what we use:
o	For example:  We pay the minimum charge or actual usage, whichever is higher.

Ricki is constructing the T&D only contract (which he claims will be similar in structure to the previous contract), with the inclusion of T&D pricing and swing.  I also reminded him that he needs to provide the audited financial statements to us.  Attached is a deal diagram with the most current information that we have.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,

John Kiani

Stuart,
The financial data will not be completed by tomorrow.  As I stated in yesterday's meeting, I would not know how long it would take to prepare everything until I looked at it.  The memo will have to be sent without the financial data.

Attached is my draft of the "two-pager" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart

Gerald:

    I have been contacted by Kim Torres of the Assumption Parish Police
Jury.  She has some questions and concerns about the Purchase & Sale
Agreement, to wit:

1).  They want to add warranty language to ? 4 as follows:

    Seller warrants that it is the record title owner to the property
being sold, and warrants it has good and merchantable title, free of any
and all liens or encumbrances, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
buyer for the same.

    Seller warrants that it is a corporation in good standing and that
persons executing this sale on behalf of seller has valid and binding
authority to do so.

I believe this additional language is acceptable with some minor
revisions which I will do.

2).  They are concerned about the warranty language which covers
hazardous wastes in ? 4.  They tell me that they have not done an
environmental inspection of the property.  They want to know if there
have ever been any underground tanks or other hazardous waste sources on
the property.  They are looking for something in writing that no such
sources existed.

3).  Upon checking the conveyance records, they found that on March 31,
1993, Louisiana Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. sold the property to
Louisiana Resources Co., Inc.  Then, on February 28, 2000, Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Co., L.P. again sold the property to LRCI, Inc.  I
have not done a title exam so I cannot explain this discrepancy.

4).  She gave me the physical address of the property and the name of
the Police Jury President which I will insert in the documents.

Please contact me to discuss our response to these concerns.

Keith

Lt. Bieraugel,

I doubt you are able to receive email at this time, but just in case you
are...............wanted to let you know that you are making the news!  Just
read an article in the USA Today online that lists your ship as one in the
Arabian Sea that has launched Tomahawks.  So I'm bragging about you to everyone
in my office....."My buddy Paul, as Chief Weapon Officer, is lobbing missiles at
the Taliban, he's pushing the button himself!"  I know you guys are well-trained
and just doing your job, but your college buddies are proud of you and the
entire country is behind you (90% approve the actions in a poll!).

So God bless and Godspeed, you get back safely to those four kids of yours!

Take care bud,
Ern

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read "30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words "or interruptible" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term "letter" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.  

Alisha Mahabir

Do you remember when we were all at Grappino's for HPL, and Brian Redmond asked me how I would depict Enron in a painting?  I thought about it for a few days, and came up with this painting, which I call "Endless Possibilities".  See what you think.

Dear Fellow Diver;

Ok, ok, I know I said I'd do better job of getting these out on time, but now you can stop sending me emails asking when the next newsletter is coming out!  Here's a quick update. We've added about 11,000 new fellow divers to this month's newsletter, which brings us up to about 260,000 PADI Divers worldwide, making this the most widely read newsletter in the industry!

>From the entry-level certification numbers we're seeing, you're all doing your part by  bringing many new divers into our great sport.  Please keep up the good work.  However, PADI and the diving industry do need your help in another way.  Recently, an Associated Press article, based on a study by the National Sporting Goods Association, was released saying that US participation in scuba diving fell way off in 2000.  I know it's not true because PADI's numbers were up and we represent the lion's share of the market.  So how can you help?  When you're asked to participate in any market survey,  please take a minute to answer the questions and let them know you are not only a diver, but also a PADI diver. When they ask about activities, name scuba.

About a month ago, the Regional Managers (that's our great team of sales/training people who visit retailers and resorts), for PADI Americas had a great sales meeting on Orcas Island in Washington.  We all worked hard and dived hard while we were there.  We stayed at the Rosario Resort (a really cool place by the way!)(http://www.rosarioresort.com)  and would like to thank Ron Kenny from Island Dive and Water Sport for showing us a great time and some fantastic diving. If you're in the area, or just want to dive with a giant octopus, give Ron a call.  Great customer service and good times are guaranteed. Check out Island Dive and Water Sport at www.divesanjuan.com. Be sure to tell Ron that I told you about his operation. I love it when PADI retail and resort operators call me to say someone mentioned the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter to them!

I'd also like to thank all of you who took the time to review the consultation document  (http://www.padi.com/news/archive/last/052901_wargraves/ ) online and responded in favor of allowing responsible wreck diving, while respecting our underwater cultural heritage.  PADI on behalf of the diving industry at large is making progress on this subject and will keep you informed.

What are you doing from 26-31 July? Well, if you happen to be in Australia, swing by the Sydney Boat Show and say hello to our team from the PADI Asia Pacific office and visit all of our hard working resort and retail members exhibiting there.  This is the largest boat show in the Southern Hemisphere and this year it has a Dive Expo area. Check it out at www.sydneyboatshow.com.au. and be sure to tell the PADI staff at the show that you read about it in this newsletter.
If you've recently checked the PADI homepage, you may have seen a very historic dive industry news item (http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/todaynews/062701_historique/). On 13 June 2001, PADI and the F?d?ration Fran?aise d'?tudes et de Sports Sous-Marin (FFESSM/French Federation) agreed to work together in developing France's dive industry. The historic accord represents the start of mutual cooperation for the benefit of France's dive industry and divers worldwide.   Jean-Claude Monachon, CEO PADI Europe, summed it up best by saying, "You can come to France and dive, that's important. Divers from Europe and around the world can come to this country and experience our fabulous diving. That benefits both France and diving."

A little over a month ago, the youth chamber of commerce (JCE) from Fr?jus / St. Rapha?l, France conducted a beach cleanup that attracted a lot of media attention.  All summer long in the port of St. Rapha?l on the Mediterranean, Project AWARE pamphlets are being passed out to divers and visitors alike.  Good job to everyone involved!
The Protect the Living Reef initiative is a big success with many Project AWARE Patrons (https://www.padimembers.com/Sforms/aware/default.htm) requesting brochures, stickers and lapel pins.  The new manual, A.W.A.R.E. Our World, Our Water (http://www.padi.com/aware/get_involved/LivingReef/news/022601_ourworld_ourwater/) is really taking off as well. If you haven't read it yet, go by your PADI Dive Center or Resort and get your copy today.  And, don't forget the deadline for the Project AWARE Photo Contest (http://www.padi.com/aware/photo_2001/ ) is July 31st.
Now, get your calendar out and circle September 15th. Then, visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort and find out how you can participate in this year's International Clean-Up Day.  It's not too early to begin working with your local dive facility or organizing your own cleanup.  For details on any of the global Project AWARE programs, visit http://www.padi.com/aware/.
I am buying drinks again this year at the PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion event in Grand Cayman 8-15 November (http://www.padi.com/ptn/weeklyspecial/).  I will be there for the first few days, so if you catch me there and tell me you're a Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter reader, I'll buy you a drink (underage readers get soda!) We've already got more people going than last year, so don't delay, book your trip now!  Visit your PADI Dive Center or Resort, or contact PADI Travel Network for details.

Last but not least, for you last minute travelers, it's not too late to join Bob Coleman, Director of Marketing and Malene Thompson, Manager of Public Relations for PADI Americas during Cayman Country http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/travelnews/070201_cometocaymancountry/, August 1-5 and 8-12. Country music stars (and PADI divers) Travis Tritt, The Wilkinsons, Rascal Flats (winner of the Country Music Association's Best New Group) and SheDaisy are scheduled to perform, along with favorites the Kinleys and Chris Cagle.  Again, contact your PADI Dive Center or PADI Travel Network to make it happen. If you run into Bob, be sure to tell him you read the Dear Fellow Diver Newsletter. He might just have something for you!

Are you going diving this weekend?  If not, please do me one more favor. Take this newsletter into your local PADI facility and tell them Brian said to stop by and ask what's new?  They will not only appreciate the visit, but while you're there you can begin planning your next dive adventure, check out the latest in dive equipment or move up the diving ladder by signing up for your next PADI course!

Now, get a friend and go diving!

Brian Cronin.

I also spoke to Peggy-and she indicated that she was not working on this.  Please let me know if there is somewhere else I should have looked or called to locate documents (perhaps Angela Davis or Travis).  Also she needed to adopted some resolutions by the Board of Directors - I advised her that we still did not have a replacement for Frevert and that currently the Board only has two members -that if she provided me with another member I would be happy to prepare Consent appointing to fill vacancy created by Frevert's removal/resignation.

Gerald,

Have you had time to prepare this confirmation or are you still waiting on information from me?  We need to get this confirm out pretty quickly. I just noticed that it is just a month-long deal.  Let me know if you cannot prepare it without the Field names.

Thanks,
Judy

Gerald,

Here is another GTC Dedicated Reserves confirm that needs preparing. Here is the well information:

Field/County/State:	? /West Delta/Louisiana, Timbalier Bay/ LaFourche/Louisiana, ?/South Pass (South)/Louisiana
Well Name:		West Delta #35 Subsea, So Timbalier Bay 21, South Pass #78 Dehyd 
Meter No./Pipeline:	011413, 010442, 011492/ Tennessee Gas Pipeline

I am waiting on a call back with the field names for the West Delta and the South Pass wells.

Can we prepare the dedicated reserves confirms with just a delivery point or do we have to list all of the wells behind the delivery point?

	I probably should have picked your brain first, but I bought some
stock today.  I think the punding you guys have taken is getting a little
carried away now.  While there is uncertainty over Skilling leaving, I think
your guys fundamental position is still excellent.  Can't say I bought
enough to help turn it around, but I hope there are others who feel as I
do.....................

	Anything new going on?  Pretty much the same ol here.  Just about to
go into my busy planning period, Sept-Nov, so not looking forward to that
much.  Kids are doing well and two of my three start pre-school next week,
so mama is relieved.

	Take care,
	E

	Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
little
	early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
good
	time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

	It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
last
	week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
the new
	car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
on
	Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

	Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
him
	since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

	     Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his
are
	flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians
(sp?), a
	place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get
there at
	about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head
to the
	downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends
of mine
	from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as
well.
	Are
	you game?

	     Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell:
281-687-6893.
	I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

	     Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
getting
	into
	     Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
(281)
	772-9250.
	     If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
don't
	you just
	     call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
we'll
	ride
	     over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
seeing
	with me.
	     My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
	wedding is
	     at 7.

	     Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

	     G

	Hotel Room Confirmation








	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

  Rup,  Got a voicemail at the house from a Michael Moore (wasn't that the
guy in the Halloween movies who killed everybody) concerning a reunion for
the Class of '91.  His number is 641-357-6375.  You can go back and show
all those losers what a big important man you have become.

   I'm sure you guys rocked--so hard--on Saturday.  If I hadn't been on my
   deathbed I would have toughed it out.  I listened to you guys message as
   it
   came in, I know it you be you guys harassing me.  Laura heard it the
   next
   day and asked "you don't think JT was really over there......do you?"

   Anyway, I guess I owe somebody 16 bucks.   I also need to get your house
   key back to you.  Has any mail or magazines of mine randomly shown up at
   your place, lately?

Gerald,

Can you or anyone else who will be working on ENA Upstream contracts let me know if you get any future requests for confirmations or contracts that are for ENA Upstream? All of the purchase deals from the Originations or Mid-marketers for ENA Upstream going forward should be on the Committed Reserves confirmations and that usually does not get communicated so it can be put on the appropriate confirm/contract.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

In case anyone was wondering.....

RE: Tax Refunds

 The amount of your payment is based on the taxable income shown on your
 2000 return. The amount is 5% of your taxable income up to a maximum of
 $300 for a single taxpayer, $500 for head of household and $600 for a
 married couple filing jointly. If your tax liability after nonrefundable
 credits is less than these maximum amounts, your limit is the smaller of
 this amount or 5% of your taxable income. If you did not have a tax
 liability for 2000 but do have one for 2001, you may be able to claim the
 tax credit on your 2001 return.

 This means for those of you who made at least $6000 in taxable income
 last year (2000), you will receive $300 back on the date scheduled below:

I think it would be helpful going forward to elicit the counterparty's
organizational ID number in the signature block where we currently obtain
its jurisdiction of organization and location of chief executive office.
This would probably save a bit of time and money.

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

UPDATE

Cancellation of System Outage Notification

Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that the conference I was going to attend in Austin next week was cancelled and the organizers of the conference are now defunct.  Oh well.....I think I'll pass on going to Austin for the game.  I need a weekend at home to myself after SC and the Vegas/Grand Canyon adventure.  
 
Did you enjoy the long weekend?

Gerald,

I'm ok with the draft except I would like to see some language for tracking costs, at least on an aggregate basis so we can assess the risk as the project develops.  I believe that our risk is near zero if the project is going to come in for less than $5.5 MM overall.  I would hope that Gulf Power is appropriately incentivized to manage their way towards a less than $5.5 MM number as they may ultimately lose it back to the commission in lower rates.  Push this and any other comments back to Jeff and let's get this closed up for signature tomorrow morning.

Thanks,

Man, I thought it was your job to keep these off-balance-sheet deals clean!  I
thought we had seen the bottom yesterday, but I guess the market is anticipating
additional debt downgrades.  I bought in at $37, and am considering the ol'
Texas double-down - get my average price down to $25 - but even that looks shaky
at the moment.  I trust that you guys will pull through............

What's going on?  Have you hooked up with George at any UT games?  Wonder how
married life is treating him, haven't heard from him.  Haven't  heard from Paul
since our last email, have you?

I think your on solid ground.  I think the stock will stay down for a
little while until they name those that will join Lay in the office of the
chairman.  We continue to beat earnings estimates, but things like
broadband, Dahbol,  and now Skilling put pressure on the stock.

Not much new going on.  Just hanging out.  Working.  Will be heading to
Austin for the game on Sept 1.  Let's see if the horns can live up to all
the hype.  I have a pair of season tix for all the home games, so I will

      I probably should have picked your brain first, but I bought some

   think
   your guys fundamental position is still excellent.  Can't say I bought
   enough to help turn it around, but I hope there are others who feel as I
   do.....................

      Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a
   little
      early, so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a
   good
      time on Friday night?  How is everything going?

      It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights
   last
      week to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of
   the new
      car with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points
   on
      Friday and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

      Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of
   him
      since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

           Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his
   are
      flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians
   (sp?), a
      place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get
   there at
      about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head
   to the
      downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends
   of mine
      from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as
   well.
      Are
      you game?

           Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell:
   281-687-6893.
      I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

           later,
           E

           Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be
   getting
      into
           Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.
   (281)
      772-9250.
           If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why
   don't
      you just
           call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great,
   we'll
      ride
           over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been
   seeing
      with me.
           My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
      wedding is
           at 7.

           Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

      Hotel Room Confirmation








           Gerald,

           Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
   $129
      rate.
           Below
           you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
      matters
           which
           one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
      They're both
           on
           my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

           I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
   from
      SA.  I
           estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
      right?)
           We'll
           actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
   family
      from the
           Valley will be there as well.

           If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
   at
      the
           hotel
           sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
   wedding
      together
           from
           there.

           In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
   got
      him a
           gift
           yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Baby girl Maxwell was born at 2:18 a.m. this morning.  Mother, Daddy and Baby are doing fine.

As soon as I have further information, such as name, weight, etc., I will send out a "follow-up" notice.

Thanks.

Sorry, I'm already booked with Volume Management at that time.  I've spoke with George to get the latest decisions on what's happening to the Appalachian deals.  There seems to be a few open items and the effective date for moving these deals is undetermined.  He feels, we should hold off on having this meeting till the actual effective date has been set?  He should be hearing something in the next week or two.

Gerald,

Here are the templates that Shawna left.  I am not sure if any of these will be sufficient as a Master for wellhead gas. We can talk about it further once you have a chance to look it over and discuss it with Jeff Hodge.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Judy

1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express language.  

2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be included in any physical contract that will be included in a master netting agreement, especially because of the current international situation and security concerns.

See attached reline version to read the changes.

 
3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.

4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.

 

The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1 (to use with collateral annex).

As promised. The Illinois Power CA info is: 
	
Counterparty:Illinois Power 
	        500 S.27th
	        Decataur, Ill 62521
	        Attn: Steve Warren

Deal info: IP is the Utility relative to our proposed NICOR transaction
Facility: Nicor Storage Facility at Troy Grove, Ill

Note: IP is owned by Dynegy, however, I understand that IP is bound by "affiliate rules" with regards to Dynegy. How comfortable are you with this? Do you think we need additional language in the CA to protect us?


With regards to the Devon CA the following are the Devon comments;
 

You should add at the beginning of paragraph 3, the following:  "Each party represents that in providing Confidential Information to the other, it has the right and authority to do so."
Whenever we look at a CA, we should endeavor to limit it in time and coverage.  You say that the agreement concerns purchase of electricity in the Carthage area, but in the opening paragraph, the CA states that it is related to "a proposed sale and/or purchase of natural gas or fuel."
You should get this clarified to say something more definitive.  For example, more definitive language would be something like "...in connection with a proposed sale and/or purchase of electricity in the Carthage Field area for purpose of providing power to compression facilities."
Other than that, the CA looks good.  Thanks.
  
>>> Blaine Wofford 07/25/01 07:52AM >>>
Jim, do you mind taking a quick look at this document. It's relative to the purchase of electricity for the Carthage area.

Thanks,
Blaine

Wow!  Enron employees and other Houstonians are showing such generosity!  

The response to the blood drive has been outstanding.  Employees from Continental Airlines and other surrounding corporations have come to our blood donation site to give.  Blood Center personnel have informed us that because of the overwhelming response donations are now being taken on a first-come, first-served basis.  The Blood Center is attempting to keep appointments on schedule.  However, we ask for your patience and understanding if there is a delay. 

It is indeed gratifying to witness your continued generosity to the community and beyond.

Your letter agreement is fine.  We do, however, need copies of the "WIC
Contracts" to attach as Exhibit "A".  A fax would be fine and we can attach
them.  My fax number is (918)-586-4801 and the telephone number is (918)
-560-4979.  Thanks for your help.

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Hi Jason and Veronica,

I have left messages with both of you regarding negotiations with Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  Basically, they sent us language limiting any recourse that ENA Upstream might have against the personal assets of any partner, officer, director, employee, or stockholder of Tenaska.  We need to determine whether the company is secure enough for us to agree to this provision.  This is the only thing preventing us from signing this agreement and they are anxious to get it executed.  Please let me know as soon as is reasonably feasible.

Thanks,

Alisha

OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: Monday, June 11th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Dear Eva:  Gerald Nemec, Senior Counsel, ENA, suggests the following edits :

Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!  

Sincerely, 
Eva Rainer

Mary, 

Below is a draft of the language for the email to Gary Chapman of Dow Chemical, who wanted me to document our request informally so as to start the bidding process within Dow.  If you have revisions, just forward them to me and I will paste them into a clean email to send to him.  Please let me know what you think:

We are pleased to be able to give you a progress report on the condition of Graeme White who was injured in Wednesday's explosion at Teesside Power Station.

He has been able to open his eyes now and is taking food.  His condition is still described as "stable".

Please don't send flowers, but cards and messages for Graeme will be welcome.  They should be sent to the address below or c/o Julie Webster at Enron's Stockton office who will ensure they are promptly delivered.

Graeme was visited last night by Jeff Skilling and Brian Stanley and they also met members of his family.  Other colleagues planning a visit should contact Julie Webster (+44 1642 623004) or Graham Moore (+44 1642 442133) who are coordinating the program.

The weekend was a blast.  I won $116 at the craps table (I'm addicted now and my dad thinks I need to join gamblers anonymous).  We kayaked on the Colorado River - about 11 miles - on Saturday and the weather was spectacular.  And we hiked the Grand Canyon on Sunday - an amazing site!  It reminded me of a spontaneous college road trip.  We had a lot of fun.  Let's talk about another football game in the future or go get drinks sometime.  
 
Have a good week!

I was in Austin for most of the weekend.  A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.  We just went out on 4th Street instead.  Went to the game Sat. night.  We won so that was good.  How was the girls road trip?

Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that the conference I was going to attend in Austin next week was cancelled and the organizers of the conference are now defunct.  Oh well.....I think I'll pass on going to Austin for the game.  I need a weekend at home to myself after SC and the Vegas/Grand Canyon adventure.  
 
Did you enjoy the long weekend?

CPS - City Public Service

1. CPS is being audited by the State of Texas and they do not have all required paperwork in place for our account  

2. KEY ISSUE: Will ENA be Sub-Contracting documents out to third parties? If not ENA will need to execute paperwork stating such.

3. Agreements not covered:
	a. Contract that expires Feb 2002 CPS estimated value $20,000,000.00
	b. Contract that expired Feb 2001 CPS estimated value     $900,000.00

4. Enabling Agreement sounds like a parent agreement of the gas purchase agreement they  currently have in place with ENA.

5. Enabling Agreement ENA currently has in place with CPS was signed by Dan Hyvel 

6. Agreements not covered:
	a. Contract that expires Feb 2002 CPS estimated value $20,000,000.00

Hey Guys!  I just got back from traveling two weeks in China, so I am now able to answer my emails.  A friend of mine here at Enron has a brother that lives in China and he got married to a Chinese national.  So I decided to join them for the wedding and sightseeing.  The sights were pretty amazing.  Great Wall, Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, etc.  Definitely culture shock though.  I know what it feels like to be a rock star now.  I was pretty much stared at wherever I went.  I am sure they think I look like a big nosed western devil freak.  The food wasn't as bad as I thought, although I did get the trots the last two days in country.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten the mutton.  

Fortunately I missed the flood of the century, Ernie!  I heard about it the first week in China.  Wasn't much I could do from China, so I just kept my fingers crossed and fortunately the house was safe and sound when I got back.  Some jackass drove up on my front yard and left some tire tracks.  There must have been high water in the street that he was trying to avoid.  Doooh!!

Other than that everything is going fine.  Doing the old dating thing!  Boy is that a ton of laughs.  Women at this age are definitely interesting.  I spend most of my time avoiding questions like, "Where is this relationship headed?"  Uh excuse me, but we only met last week!  

Congratulations, Paul on little Chloe.  I checked out the pics on your website and the family looks great.  Bieraugel you still look the same as the last time I saw you, but  Whoa, is that a little gray hair I saw on you Paul?  Oh well, we all have chinks in our armor.  Seriously though it is a beautiful family and I know it must be tough to be away from them.  Are you going to be staying in the Navy for awhile?  10 more years and you can retire eh!

Ernie,  Sounds like things are going well at work.  Congrats on the promo.  We definitely need to do a better job of getting together here in Houston.  You need to get the wife and we need to have dinner one night or something!  The Buick sounds prime.  240HP ought to take care of it.  Sounds better than the shaka-mobile.  What the hell ever happened to that car anyway?  I still love to tell stories about that car.  You can't beat a K-mart lawn chair for comfortable automobile seating.  Ernie, I think my focus is on the 5 series BMW.  Unfortunately my stock portfolio has delayed my auto purchase for awhile.

Let's pledge to all do better at keeping in touch.  It is great to hear from you guys.  We need to plan a little get together when you get back from sea.  It has been to damn long. Take care and be safe, Bruddas.  

Gerald

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.
Paul.

Gerald!

Oneok is okay with our form of guarantee, they do not want to make any changes to our form.  As a result they requested that we issue said guarantee, the relevant information is listed below.

Have we completed our review of their language?  I hope that we can coordinate the incoming and outgoing for the same time.

Thanks
Rudwell.

Gerald:

I do not think we should be initialling on behalf of EES.  I suggest that you call Jim Keller at EES and discuss this with him to see how he would want to handle this.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,  Shane Lakho is currently preparing several TPA for Enron Energy Services and another EES entity.  I know that portions of EES are rolling into wholesale.  Should we be initialing for EES?  The agreements are Enron's standard TPA form so there shouldn't be any issues.

Donna and Shane,
As I mentioned to you previously, Gerald Nemec will be handling the trading partner agreements upon my departure. His extension is  33512. As has been the practice in the past, Gerald should initial all trading partner agreements and any amendments prior to execution by a VP. I understand that Suzanne Calcagno has initialed some of these agreements without authorization from legal and while I understand she has recently received her law degree and awaits bar results, since she is not part of our legal department we would ask that you continue to abide by the procedures we have set in place to come through our legal department  until such time as Barbara Gray authorizes a different procedure. If you have any questions about that please feel free to contact Barbara Gray at ext. 36832.

Thanks and it has been a pleasure working with you!

I am also working on pulling information out of SAP and assisting with the ECS financial data since Karen is so involved in the monthly close as well as other requests.  I have to agree with Karen.  It is taking some time to search thru the data in SAP since some of the transactions were paid, received, recorded in ENA and we have to search thru the 1000's of transactions in ENA.  Also the files and records have not all been retrieved since essentially no financials have been prepared this year and anyone who worked on ECS in the past are gone.  I am trying to piece all of this together, unfortunately it will take a little time.  I can call Patty and discuss this with her and set her expectations for receiving the financial data as soon as we can pull the finacial data together next week.  I just think it needs to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible before it is sent.

Stuart,
The financial data will not be completed by tomorrow.  As I stated in yesterday's meeting, I would not know how long it would take to prepare everything until I looked at it.  The memo will have to be sent without the financial data.  

Karen

Attached is my draft of the "two-pager" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart

Debra,

Jill is ready to finalize the Aspect Amendment and send it to them today to sign.  I have editted the amendment that you provided to include the new pricing as well as the Keep Whole language.  

Please review the revised pricing section and advise if we can remove the "DRAFT" from the amendment and send it to the customer(s) to sign.

Thanks,
Judy

 Judy attached is the Aspect Amendment as discussed.   The  first paragraph has been revised to reflect the assignment to ENA.   Article 2. now states term dates.  Concerning Articles 3.1 and 3.3, Gerald would not agree to "one sentence". Finally, I  included a provision regarding changes to working interest (see # 9), and incorporated meter number on Schedule I.  Please let me know if you have any other questions and or changes.

Gerald,

Can you or anyone else who will be working on ENA Upstream contracts let me know if you get any future requests for confirmations or contracts that are for ENA Upstream? All of the purchase deals from the Originations or Mid-marketers for ENA Upstream going forward should be on the Committed Reserves confirmations and that usually does not get communicated so it can be put on the appropriate confirm/contract.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Marcus,
Sorry for the delay . . . it's difficult to get folks moving during holiday weeks.  Anyhow, our legal group has indicated that they would like to have a Master Firm Agreement in place with CSU to which we can attach concise Transaction Agreement Exhibits detailing specific deals.  I have attached the Master Firm Agreement for your review and will follow shortly with the Transaction Agreement Exhibit for our swing deal.

 

Please let me know your thoughts on the Master Firm and don't hesitate to call with any questions, comments, and/or concerns.

Stephanie,

See attached:
	-I checked the spelling and changed the words miss-spelled
	-In para (2) deleted reference to "in ____." Per discussion with William Fleenor if the agreement is not specific to the Longview 	plant, we should have no accounting issues.
	-Added in para 16 that "ENA may disclose to it's affiliates and to"

Please let me know and will forward to Dominic. He is out today and will actually see this on Monday but want it there this week for them.

Thanks

 instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of the Affected Party an=
d the Notifying Party under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall=
 be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exerci=
sed by the Notifying Party and/or the Notifying Party's Affiliates.  The No=
tifying Party will give the Affected Party notice of any setoff effected un=
der this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provid=
ed that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the se=
toff.  For purposes of this Section 4.5, "Owed" shall mean any amounts owed=
 or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have =
been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.  Amounts subje=
ct to the setoff permitted in this Section 4.5 may be converted by the Noti=
fying Party into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated a=
t the rate of exchange at which the Notifying Party, acting in a reasonable=
 manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of=
 the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, the Noti=
fying Party may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respec=
t of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other wh=
en the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section 4.5 shall be eff=

ded under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without prejudice=
 and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of a=

e otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise). =
 Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in=

Gerald/Debra,

There is one additional change to the amendment that you are working on for Jill Zivley for the Aspect, Helmrick & Payne, etc. contract. We need to include a MDQ of 16,000 MMBtu/day. 

Also, could you please let me know approximately how long it will take to be able to provide Jill with a draft to send to the customer? We need to get something to the customer on Monday if at all possible.

Thanks,
Judy

Shane,

The three companies in question need to submit a form that delegates the authority you have listed below to Enron Net Works, LLC, your employer.  Then, you, in your position with Enron Net Works, LLC, can have the access which your request.

We need to be VERY careful about how we treat the various Enron legal entities.  Enron Net Works, LLC is NOT a subsidary of ENA.  It is wholly owned by Enron Corp.  Also, it is separate from the three entities which hold transportion contracts.  It cannot act on behalf of those companies without a delegation of authority.

I comment Kim and Jim for their astute question.

Subject:	RE: Enron North America

         These three companies are subsidiaries of Enron North America/Enron Networks.
        I work for the Electronic Business Development Group of Enron North America.  My job is to initiate Trading Partner Agreements with pipelines and implement EdI nominations for the schedulers.  In order to accomplish this, I need access to the pipeline's EBB sites.  I have to send nomination via EDI or flat file.  I have to check to be sure my noms hit the pipe's web sites.  I also need to get a list of the meter numbers and other pertinent information.  Most pipes do not have this set up in the test environment.  I have to also test in production before rolling this out to the schedulers.
Enron MW, enovate and Enron Upstream are separate shippers with either their own Trading partner agreements or amendments designating Enron North America as the  third party provider, however, they do not have their own EBB group.  Donna Greif, Richard pinion and myself are their EBB group.. . All electronic noms are sent via Enron North America.  The schedulers will or already have access to your web site.  I could use their IDs to test but
I have my own IDs for at least 22 other pipes that these three companies do business with, therefore, I am confused why this request sounds odd.

If you need more clarification, please feel free to call me.


Thank you

Shane works for Enron Net Works LLC.
If Enron Net Works LLC is a designee of these three companies, then she can have access.
If not, she cannot have access.
Why don't you have her give me a call.
The request sounds a little odd.

Shane Lakho is asking for access to the following company:

	Enovate, LLC
	Enron MW
and	ENA Upstream

Shane works for Enron North America.   How are the companies listed above associated with ENA, is it okay for ENA to have access to the above listed company information?

   Thanks for setting me up on ETS and Northern Border as ENA.

   I  would also like to get access to all four of these pipes for ENA's other entities, such as
  enovate, LLC, Enron MW and ENA Upstream.  We are not agents for these entities but a 'third party service provider".  I need access in order to test edi noms.
  Once I send files for these in production, I have to log onto to their EBB sites and view the noms,scheduled quantities etc.
Do I need new user ID for each of these entities or can you use  the same ID as  ENA's.

Call me if you have any questions.

Shane

We are currently trading under GTC Spot contracts with El Paso for ENA Upstream.  Would you prefer to review their Master agreement or just send them our GISB?

I will also forward this list to the Global Outsourcing group to handle the HPL contract as it sees fit.  I will wait to hear from you on how to handle these - just let me know!

I basically pulled all active contracts with contract type GISB Base Contract 6.3.1 or GISB Base Contract under all maintenance groups that I have access to.  The list is sorted by maintenance group, counterparty name, and then contract number.  I need only the maintenance group, contract number, contract type, Enron entity, Enron ID, counterparty name, counterparty ID, and effective date for all such contracts where trading method equals WRITTEN only. 
 
Please do not hesitate to call me at home if you need additional information (I will be leaving at 5:00).  You can page me at (713) 710-6084 or call my cell phone (713) 557-9010.  My home number (where I'll be after 6:30 or so) is (713) 953-1775.

If you can supply me with the selection criteria you used to create your spreadsheet and the data fields you want to include, it would be easier for me to generate a new report and save it to  a spreadsheet with exactly what you want.  I will work on this after class this evening.

Hi Sundar, 

I know that Fred is out all this week, so I'm hoping you can help me with an urgent IT request.  I submitted request 3143 today at Legal's request.  I need to provide Legal with information on contracts that need to be amended or terminated immediately.  Is there any way you can run this report for me soon?  I ran an initial query out of Global Contracts but was not able to filter or sort on trading method.  I was at least able to narrow down the list of contracts to run your report from.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

We are disappointed to announce that Philippe Bibi, president and CEO of Enron Net Works, has resigned from Enron. Philippe will be joining Putnam Investments in Boston, Mass. as Chief Technology Officer.

Philippe joined Enron in 1995, as Chief Information Officer for Enron Capital & Trading, and has been a key member of the team that built Enron's IT organization, including our numerous successful e-commerce initiatives.  Philippe has been a great asset to Enron and our IT efforts.

For six years, his creativity, intelligence, and focus have benefited the company in many ways.  He will be missed.

Philippe has agreed to make himself available to assist in the transition of his responsibilities.  In the interim, all of the employees who report to Philippe will continue reporting to the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works. 

Please join us in thanking Philippe for his  many years of service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

Subject: Third Quarter Earnings Results

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Hey Gerald,

I just wanted to update you on what I have been up to.  I have been working on a couple of small assignments for various lawyers and paralegals.  Steve Van Hooser brought me in on a big project that he is trying to wrap up.  The documents are to be executed tomorrow.  Despite the work that I have been given, I don't feel that I have much to work on.  I have been stopping in offices asking for work, but nobody wants me to work.  Any suggestions?

Alisha

Before you leave today or first thing in the morning, please advise Bradford, Rohauer and Kitchen by email of the status of the particular master netting agreements on which you are working.  Barbara Gray is coordinating the release of the gas receivable financing so that we can execute the netting agreements and she will advise as and when finalized.  As previously noted today, the power receivable financing will be released as we sign the netting agreements on a counterparty-by-counterparty basis.

John,

Do we need to send out Revised Master under ENA Upstream Company LLC ?
Otherwise we have to send out a revised Confirmation under GTC.

The Stevens Oil & Gas deal (06/01/01 - 05/30/02 - Sitara # 892828)) was only entered in the system today. Mary (Terry) Franklin entered it, but under John Grass instructions they entered it under ENA Upstream Company LLC  -  we need to send out revised Confirmation.

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

Ellen

Folks,

Good work on the documents that you've pulled together to get to Nicor and to Shell Capital.  I have added the Letter of Interest along with slightly modified versions of the others attached.  Review, make any minor changes, and let's get these out to Shell Capital (Risks & Mitigants, Schedule) and Nicor (Letter of Interest, Letter of Intent, and Schedule) today.  I would have Gerald take a look at the Letter of Interest prior to sending it to make sure that I didn't mis-represent anything.  Sorry about the hold up on my end from being on the road.

    
Thanks,

Gerald, 
Per our conversation yesterday, attached is the Unocal Term Sheet for your review and comment.  This is a non-binding proposal.  Note that the items in red are either questionable items or rates/prices that need to be confirmed and/or filled in.  
  

The compression guys are meeting with Unocal tomorrow (Friday) early afternoon to discuss the project and term sheet.

Please advise.

I am sure the captioned parties have not been included in any master netting agreements to date and should not be included due to marketing affiliate rules; however, given the financings of the pipes, just a reminder TO NOT INCLUDE THEM IN ANY MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT.

I wanted to follow up with you to see what the status of the assignments of the Matrix Oil & Gas GTC Firm contract and the Key Production Master Purchase Interruptible contract from Enron North America to ENA Upstream is.

Thanks,
Judy

FYI relating to Napoleonville Matters

Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!  

Sincerely, 
Eva Rainer

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, October 28th, at Greenspoint Mall.  I continue to serve on the board of JDRF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDRF again this year.  JDRF is a very efficient organization in which approximately 85% of all money raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise $400,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 6 years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the walk this year is "Mission: Possible" and we would like to have you join us for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 600 Enron people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included in the first important and informative training session taking place this week.  In addition, you may go to cr.enron.com and sign up as a volunteer online if you prefer.

Thank you very much for your support.

I haven't heard from you in a while and wanted to see what was up.
Colorado was incredible!  The house is now in the building stages and
it is all very exciting.  I had so much energy in the cool weather it
was unbelievable.  I am now past the 8 month mark and have about 7
weeks to go.  I am so ready!

I was thinking about your screen play the other day.  Did you ever
seriously work on it?  Is it still in progress?

What is going on in your love life?  Are you still with Barbara?
Give me an update.

Love and miss you!  Your nephew says hello!!

Are you Ready2Go ?

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your Enron laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employees and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2268D).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Thank you for your time.
The Ready2Go Team

	Brandi:

	Please see the list of requested documents and information
concerning the Louisiana Resources Company pipeline and terminal.  We have
also listed a number of questions concerning separate issues about the
facility and pipeline that we would like to discuss.  Some of the requests
are redundant to our previous discussions.  Thanks.

*	List (and copies) of all applicable state and federal agency permits
for ownership/operations of the pipeline, terminal, and pier/dock facilities
in state waters
*	Copies of all surface use agreements, right-of-ways, easements, and
leases for the combination of facilities and what ongoing costs are
associated with each
*	All other agreements that affect the operations and/or the ownership
of the rights of way and/or surface use, including, but not limited to
concurrent use agreements (i.e. where there are two pipelines within the
same right of way), Operating Agreements, Agreements with the Owner of the
Gas Plant at the beginning point of the pipeline system, marketing
agreements, etc., if any.
*	Copies of any environmental audits or reviews of the facilities
*	Historical operating statements for the facilities
*	Copies of all lease agreements for the use of the facilities
(Genesis and others)
*	Copies of any structural or integrity reviews or assessments of the
facilities
*	Please provide a description of all jurisdictional authority matters
that affect the ownership/operations of the facility
*	A list of any past violations, spills, or other accidents
*	Copy/list of all title documents to be conveyed in the sale,
including the ROW interests and leases
*	List of consents needed for transfer of the assets being purchased
*	Copies of any specific insurance requirements
*	Please explain the responsibilities for the
decommissioning/abandonment of the facility
*	Copies of construction permits from the federal, state, and parish
agencies that address natural and cultural resources along with any
compensatory mitigation agreements for resource damages
*	Regulatory compliance records, environmental and safety, for DOT or
Louisiana Office of Pipeline Safety as well as alignment sheets




*	What is the agreement/responsibility of the parties with respect to
the old Swift gas plant at the end of the pipeline?  Does LRC's
responsibility extend to the border of the site, or is the site under the
responsibility of LRC?  Who is the current owner of this site if not LRC?
Are there any agreements between the owner of this facility and LRC?
*	Are there any known non-compliance issues with respect to the
facility's operations or current design/layout?
*	Has there been any leaks within the system?
*	Does the Genesis contract require them to pig the line before their
lease expires?  We will most likely need to have the entire line pigged
prior to the transfer of ownership.
*	What is the selling entity for these assets?  If pre-existing
liabilities are discovered, what selling entity would be financially
responsible?
*	What will be the status of the tank inventory and linefill upon
closing the transaction?

We are probably to late for that... I believe we have enough paper to address including agency agreements which address confidentiality.. I am conducting my efforts in good faith and a expeditious fashion.... If we cannot resolved a good portion of the paper by the end of business today, there is a possibility that this thing dies anyways.

James,

Thanks for the e-mail.  Same to you for the information provided to Eric in the meantime.  We are having our legal prepare a CA and will coordinate with Mark and Mike to make sure that it adequately covers what we are all trying to do.  Mark/Mike, I will call you later today to discuss our collective strategy and get your input on the CA.  Let me know if you need anything else at this point in time.

Chris,

I spoke with Eric yesterday and he said that you did a great sales job and he wants to try to work with Enron.  He is marketing his gas through John Bower of Natural Gas Associates.  No one here is too impressed with NGA and have visited with them before on behalf of other clients but will meet with John this afternoon to discuss Black Diamond's needs.  From Eric it sounds like they want gas purchases in addition to other physical services.  If that is the case we will bring Mark Whitt's group in on the deal.  I will keep you informed as to the progress.  Mike Legler will likely be taking the lead of this after today.  Thanks for your efforts!  James

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

There is a volume discrepancy for deal # 117853/YK6095.1 as reported in Sitara and TAGG.  Please take a look at this deal.  
Also, is anybody working on a special contract for this deal as it is a 2-year deal attached to a GTC.

Thanks for your help,

Ann

Does that mean that we don't need all the wellhead / meter information ? Because I still have not got any meter information from your group.

Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

A sitting federal judge has not only endorsed the bid
concept embodied by Provere.com, he has awarded 'Lead

conducted by Judge Vaughn Walker, U.S. District, Northern
District of California (San Francisco).

Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.  Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal, but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you have them or know where they are.  

Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document search.

Best wishes,
Mary

Hi.  I meant to call you today.  Yes - count me in on the rental car.  I'll book my flight now.  thanks for reminding me!  (I was teasing Bruce last night....I asked him about hotels and he mentioned this idea about renting a house and that I'd be sharing a room with a bunch of guys!  I'm thinking.....this is definitely Bruce planning because I don't see how sharing a room with a bunch of guys in a big house is a good thing for me.  Can I plz speak to Lydia!!

Janel,  How is it going?  I booked this flight for myself.  Talked to Bruce and he is trying to set up a beach house or in the alternative, rooms for us at the Sea Trail hotel.  Let me know if you want me to book a rental car for us to share.

Hey guys.  I went to Expedia.com and found the Delta Flights Referenced below for $226/person.  This is still a really good deal and I would jump all over it if I were you.  Here are the flights:

Friday, August 24 Delta #4516 IAH to ATL (departs 10:10am, arrives 1:15pm)
		   Delta #4107 ATL to MYR (departs 2:55pm, arrives 4:36pm)

Sunday, August 26 Delta #4684 MYR to ATL (departs 11:40am, arrives 12:55pm)
		     Delta #2063 ATL to IAH (departs 3:50pm, arrives 4:56pm)

For those of you who don't know how to use Expedia.com.  Just go to the website (www.expedia.com) , search flights from Houston to Myrtle Beach on the above dates and select the flights that work best for you.  You can input your frequent flier number and pay online via credit card.

Good luck and let me know if I can help at all.

Paul,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with Louise and myself this past Wednesday.  I felt that the meeting was very informative and that discussions between Enron and Marathon have progressed in a constructive manner to broach a potential asset management outsourcing arrangement.  

As promised during the meeting, I have attached Enron's Confidentiality / Non-disclosure agreement. Enron's appropriate legal contact for further questions or comments regarding this document would be Mr. Gerald Nemec.  He can be reached at (713) 853-3512.

After the Confidentiality Agreement is signed, I look forward to delivering a proposal for the above mentioned commercial arrangement.

If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to call.  I can be reached at (713) 853-1931.

Regards,

Jean

Dear Fellow Diver;

Wow!  Since being mentioned in last months Fellow Diver newsletter, hundreds of you have downloaded PADI's  "Bring A Friend" offer from PADI ( http://www.padi.com/promo/poker/download.asp ) that pays you $50.00 just for getting three new people certified as PADI Open Water divers. I have also received hundreds of questions, so I thought I'd take a minute to answer the most frequently asked ones.  Here they are:

What's the catch?

There is none.  Honest. Just download the form and for every three divers you bring into a PADI Dive Center or Resort location who complete the PADI Open Water Diver course by February 28, 2002, I send you $50.00.  That's it!

If I get 6 people certified can I get $100.00?

Yes, just make copies of the form, and for every 3 new PADI Divers your bring in by February 28, 2002, I will send you $50.00.

Why is PADI doing this?

Actually, that's pretty simple to answer. PADI is trying to get more divers into the sport. It's not a secret that the dive industry's growth in the US has been flat over the last couple of years, so we're trying to "kick start" the industry with an outrageous offer. (See, I told you there wasn't a catch!)

I heard that some PADI facilities are offering additional incentives if I show them a copy of my PADI check. Are there other offers for getting new divers?

This is the best part of this whole program.  Within hours of PADI announcing the launch of this program,  we received inquiries from PADI Members and others in the industry who wanted to add additional incentives on top of the $50.00. The results have been amazing. Several dozen PADI Retailers have called or emailed to tell me about  their offers. These include:

Ocean Enterprises, CA; Ocean Divers, FL; Deep Six, FL; Bird's Underwater, FL; Ocean Odyssey, WA; A-1 Scuba, CO; Ocean Concepts, HI; Mass Diving, MA; Poseidon Adventures, DE; Annapolis Scuba, MD; Sport Chalet, CA; Divers Market, MA; Blue Horizons, PA; Aquatic Adventures, WI; Sea Side Dive, MI;  Blue Ocean, NY; Underwater Phantasea, CO; Underwater Connection, CO; Weavers Dive & Travel, Boulder, CO; Ocean's Window, TX; The Dive Spot, TX; A.K.A Diver, Arlington, TX;  El Mar Diving,  AZ; All Wet Scuba, AZ;, The Reef Diving Co., AZ;, We B Divin', TX;, Grapevine Scuba, TX; Hampton Dive Center, NY; and Aquatic Adventures, NY.

More PADI Dive Centers and Resorts are calling daily, so I apologize to those I've missed or inadvertently left off the list above.

Manufacturers have also stepped up to the plate and are in discussions with PADI to bring you more for your effort.  Scubapro immediately said it will issue a $25.00 rebate on Scubapro Twin Jet Fins to anyone who can show a copy of their $50.00 check from PADI as well as proof of purchase.  For details, please visit http://www.scubapro.com.

PADI resorts are stepping up to the plate, too.  Sunset House in Cayman is offering 10 percent off for anyone who shows a copy of their $50.00 check from PADI and books a stay there before March 1, 2002.  UNEXSO in the Bahamas has a $150.00 dollar offer for showing the PADI check and an additional $50.00 for every "Learn To Dive" customer you bring them.  For details on these offers go to  http://www.sunsethouse.com/ and  http://www.unexso.com.

I know you all hate long e-mails, but this has been truly incredible and there is still more good news coming.  Both Sport Diver magazine (http://www.sportdiver.com)  and Skin Diver magazine are working on additional incentives that I'm sure I'll be able to announce very soon. I also understand Seapro in Florida also has a program under development.

So, it's not just $50.00 anymore! Do this right and you can earn a heck of a lot more -- you ain't seen nothing yet.  So, what are you waiting for? Get three friends and go diving!

Brian

Golfing

Two men were about to tee off on the 18th tee box.
Their wives were waiting for them at the club house.
The first golfer tee's his ball.  As he addresses the
ball, he looks at the club house.  Then he chokes up
on the club.  He looks at the ball and then up at the
club house.  He loosens his grip and closes his
stance.  He again looks at the club house. He again
looks down at his ball and chokes up a little more on
his golf club.  He looks back up at the club house.
Finally his partner says "Forget it, you can't hit her
from here".

Gerald/Ellen

Please review & edit as necessary. If possible, once "buffed to a shine", I'd like to be able to insert this language into the GTC Confirm template above Notice information. This particular scenario is for Unimark LLC (deal #1146397).

Language Take 1:

Payment Terms:  As hereto agreed, payment by Buyer to Seller for gas received by Buyer during the preceding calendar month shall be made payable by wire transfer on the 25th Day of the Month following delivery. If the due date for any payment to be made under this Agreement is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be the following Business Day.


Please let me know as soon as possible as this is a Nov Production deal that has not yet been confirm & also due to the prior conversations Settlements, Judy, Lisa & Contracts has had with the CP.

Thank you!!!
Cyndie

Gerald,

Per our conversation, here is the addendum of provisions for Charlie Otto's deal with BHP Petroleum. As I mentioned, Charlie is expecting to close on this deal within a day or two and the customer is awaiting our comments on these provisions. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thank you for your help.

On second thought, I probably should attach a copy of the document.  Ooops!



Charlie,

Well, upon review, the lawyers wanted me to bounce the following
"Transaction Confirmation" document off you.  It references your Enfolio
Purchase contract, but give a bit more details than your Conformation sheet.
Let me know what you think as soon as possible.  Thanks,

Dan

Lisa,

As to Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A, it is my understanding that LRCI is an indirect wholy owned subsidiary of ENA.  Therefore, Enron does have the authority to sell the property and keep 100% of the proceeds.

As to the Keyston/Unocal deal, because Gerald Nemec does all the ENA Compression work, I want to be sure he is involved in drafting/reviewing any such term sheet.

Thanks,

Steve

Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows:

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine:
Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 

Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A:
Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds?

Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

Our File:  7606-001354
 
Dear Joe:
 
As you know, Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC's application for a permit to convert Napoleonville Storage No. 1 to natural gas service is pending before the Injection and Mining Division.  At this point, Bridgeline Storage Company has responded to the Request for Additional Information from your office dated June 21, 2001 and we await your response to see if any further information is needed prior to setting this application for public hearing.
Also, I would like to take this opportunity to confirm our prior conversations concerning dewatering of Napoleonville Storage No. 1.  It is my understanding from our conversations and my review of pertinent regulations that Bridgeline Storage Company, LLC may begin dewatering Napoleonville Storage No. 1 pursuant to the existing work permit to convert the well.  Unless I hear from you to the contrary, Bridgeline Storage Company will begin dewatering Napoleonville Storage No. 1 on August 1, 2001.  Of course, Bridgeline Storage Company will not store natural gas in 
Napoleonville Storage No. 1 until an Order has been issued by the Commissioner of Conservation approving such storage.
Sincerely,
Lawrence J. Hand, Jr.

Gerald,

Attached is the most recent version of the Crestone term sheet.  As Chris mentioned in the conference call with you earlier today, he would like to put some binding language into the term sheet.  Please let me know when I can come up and discuss this with you.

Thanks for your help.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Hello All,

With my last day at Enron quickly approaching, I thought it would be a good idea to set everyone up with my new address and phone in Ann Arbor.  Here you go.

110 Depot Street
Ann Arbor, MI  48104

(H): 734-214-3815

My future email address will be:

brudy@umich.edu

This won't be active until September 5 though, so you can reach me between now and then at my internet email:

bruce_rudy@lycos.com

Hope all is well with everyone.

Take Care,

Bruce

Thanks Gerald, this info is helpful.  Do you know who owns the other 60%
equity interest in Bridgeline, and how the LP is structured to give Enron
50% control with only 40% interest?

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into
Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America
Corp.

   Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re:
   the
   sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .
   As
   I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
   applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above
   transaction
   whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need
   the
   following transaction information:

   *  When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
   *  Which licenses where part of that transaction?
   *  Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
   transaction date?
   *  Which stations are constructed/operating?

   As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the
   FCC.
   To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday
   at
   the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

   Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Attached is the Guaranty that has been review by our legal department with
the changes that they requested.

Trevor  I also ran across a few contracts in  the name of Bridgeline Gas
Distribution. There hasn't been any activity on these contracts over the
past year. Should we take Bridgeline Gas Distribution off of the approve
bidders list? If not we will need it listed on the guaranty as well.

Thanks

Judy,

Attached is a very simple report I pulled together on those ENA Upstream counterparties you are trying to get masters in place with.  I ran a Sitara report to check those names against two GTC types that weren't already reported under my regular report:  Committed Reserves GTC and Wellhead Pooling Point GTC.  I'll email you my regular report and I can run something like that in the future once you decide on the threshold levels you'd like to see.

Judy,

For ENA, we have set thresholds of reporting any counterparty with 100 or more total transactions clearing on online GTCs, 100 or more deals on spot GTCs, and 30 or more deals on Firm GTCs.  While some of these obviously don't apply to ENA Upstream now (online deals), others do.  Do you want to keep the same thresholds or lower yours?  I can create a separate spreadsheet for Gerald to review if you want to have separate, and lower, deal counts.  Please let me know.  I'm getting ready to send out the August report (this is usually done the first week of the month following production).

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Stacey,

I think that is a good idea. I have attached a list of the counterparties that reflect those suppliers that are our highest priority because of the number of transactions as well as other provisions that are negotiated each month. Please let me know if there is anything else that you may need from me.

Thanks,
Judy

Judy, we currently run a monthly report that we give to Legal showing all counterparties with excess GTCs (both telephonic and online).  We also include credit information and comments regarding the status of any masters we may already have in place with the CP (if applicable).  Since Legal uses this as a tool to see where we really need to focus our negotiating efforts, would you like the report changed to include the ENA Upstream GTCs?  We can then include Gerald Nemec (and any other Legal folks you'd like to add) on the distribution.

Please let me know what you think.  If you'd like the ENA Upstream GTCs included, I will need to work with our IT guy to have the report format changed.  I'll also be happy to send you the August report once I'm done (hopefully today) so that you can see what I'm talking about.

Thanks!

The last day of the month should be used as the default. We are only changing this date when counterparties have been settling with ENA on a different date.

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Gerald,

Thanks for reminding me about where we stand on this issue. I sent John the draft affidavit and I think the best course is to wait for his response. If he asks about matters other than the draft, I'll have to check with the client and get back to him. That will give us time to formulate our response.

Bill

Bill,  The contract itself does not have a confidentiality clause, but per
Jeff Stone's email, Gulf does consider the contract proprietary information
and does not want this info voluntarily disclosed at this time.  I
forwarded the email to you earlier.

Concerning the emails etc., as I mentioned before, ECS has a copy of a
Confidentiality Agreement that we executed by Gulf,  initialed by me as ECS
attorney, but not signed by an officer of ECS.  Our business guys think we
executed this agreement.  This CA would cover all information exchanged
between Gulf and ECS.  I have asked Russell Badder's to check with Gulf to
obtain an executed copy.  Nothing in the CA agreements prohibit me from
disclosing the CA. So we could potentially provide the copy of the CA we
have to John.  Obviously the correspondence between ECS and Gulf contains
the commerical terms of our power deal as we negotiated with Gulf.  Given
Jeff's email and the CA copy I have in hand, I would not want to disclose
the emails and memo's without Gulf's explicit permission.  Let me know if
you have any ideas on the best way to approach this with WFLA.

   Gerald,

   Where are we in the process of gathering e-mails and other discovery
   that may be responsive to WFLA's request? Also, can I tell John Haswell
   that our contract with Gulf does contain a confidentiality clause? We
   discussed this but I can't remember if we agreed that I could disclose
   it.

Chris,
Wanted to let you know that the investment in Kachine/Gallup is $1,775,144.85, not $1,742,855.41.  This will reduce the net gain to $324,158.15.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Karen,

Per our discussion, you will find attached the letter that Jean is going to sign.  According to the numbers showed to me by Carol earlier this week, we should expect to book a gain of $356,447.59 as a result of doing this (calculations below).  Please review and let me know if you have any comments.  I will deliver you the signed letter when I get it along with the detailed calculations.

Attached is the notice letter to EMP ECHO, LLC for ECS' election to take and make the distributions resulting from the payment of the note for Gallup and Kachina.  As we discussed Chris, Section 5.03 of the LLC Agreement governs the distributions and assuming the requirements of that section are met and upon provision of this notice, the note proceeds can be distributed to ECS.  Upon payment of the note by whoever HPL's assignee is, the original notes will need to be cancelled.  Nora, can locate these originals.

I am not sure if the address and fax for EMP ECHO is correct.  I pulled these from the agreement.  Need to verify.

Gerald,

The Upstream group is doing a considerable amount of repeat business with several customers. There is an increasing need to execute Master agreements with these customers. 

We would like to begin the development of a Master Wellhead contract that includes the same type of provisions that our Upstream GTC contracts include such as tolerances, keep whole, nomination deadlines, etc. Can you please let me know if you see any issues with changing the Master Firm contract to accomodate the Upstream business or if there is anything else that you may need from us to begin creating this Upstream Master?

Thanks,
Judy

The permit application is set for public hearing on August 29 at 10:00
a.m. in Baton Rouge.  I will forward a copy of the public notice upon
receipt.  The purpose of the public hearing is to allow any interested
parties to make comments or present evidence on the application.  Joe
Ball prefers that Bridgeline not present any evidence or testimony at
the hearing.  Joe considers the application to be evidence of everything
needed to approve the permit.  Accordingly, I do not intend to present
any evidence at the hearing.  Our role will be to observe any comments
or protests by interested parties.  Joe Ball will advise if there are
any issues raised at the hearing that require a response and we can
supplement the record in writing.  This approach is preferable because
it does not subject anyone involved with the project to
cross-examination at the hearing and it affords us time to make an
informed and calculated response (if needed).

David and Robert: considering the importance of this project to your
respective companies, I would encourage you both to attend if possible.
I will defer to David as to whether Harry Allison should attend.

The audit on these two deals show that you entered the deals. Are these deals part of the overall Torch deal that was negotiated Oct - Mar '02?  I did not see the meter numbers on the original list of gas we were buying.

Judy,

I have taken care of the 56 torch deals (in dcaf)  + sent the executed copy to the file room.  This is the one associated with wellhead GTC's.

?  There are two other Torch Deals 1085947 and 1085978 for Oct 01 and I don't believe that these are associated with the above referenced deal, but could you check?  If they are not, should I confirm as normal?

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Debra,

Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.

Thanks,
Judy

Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.  I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss. 

Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?

Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal.

Gerald, the legal matches with plats we have of the property.  I do have a faxed copy of a plat sent to me quite a while back, but it does not contain ties to quarter sections or , so I can't verify where exactly their pipe will sit.

Andy,
	Here's a revised draft.  Several comments.
	1.  I'm putting together a list of potential arbitrators.  Let's
compare notes next week.
	2.  Subject to getting a better feel for what the damages are, we
would take this case on a contingent fee, blended, or other creative basis
where the fee is tied to the result obtained.  Let us know if that's
something Enron would be interested in discussing.
	3.  If you wish, we can certainly put Tom on the pleadings. Also,
what's your preference re to being named as as counsel on your cases.  (On
cases with Lohse, we usually put both our names on the pleadings.)  Let me
know your preference.

That's credit's call.  If credit wants the old record (Constellation Energy Source Inc.) suspended, then we should.  I just need to get with Legal and find out if my group should terminate or at least trade suspend those active contracts with that CP.

Thanks,
SBR

Darren,

My apologies!  I thought you were looking for physical gas deals/contracts.  Yes, you are right.  We have a fairly new ISDA in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc.   Please work with Georgi Landau or Anthony Campos regarding contract information on these financial transactions.  Joe Hunter and/or Bob Bowen can help you with the confirmations once these deals are rebooked.  You will need to work with the trader or risk person who input the deals to have them moved.

Any physical power contract issues should be addressed to Rhonda Denton.

The deal extending through 08/31/01 I referenced earlier is Sitara deal 943572.  We have had numerous other firm baseload deals over the last year that were entered as ICC Energy Corporation.  You should probably check with Andy Ring or Scott Hendrickson regarding those deals.  I can give you deal numbers if you'd like.

I hope this clears up some of the confusion.  I'm a little concerned that ICC doesn't acknowledge the deals we have entered.  Please let me know what you find out on those.

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Stacey,

Here are the TAGG#s for the deals currently in place with Constellation Energy Source Inc:

Deal Date           TAGG #            Ending Date
02/01/01               QP3345.1         12/01/02
02/14/01               QS0083.1         10/01/01
02/14/01               QS0088.1         03/1/02
03/08/01               QV9858.1/.2     10/01/02
03/08/01               QW0004.1        03/01/03
03/20/01               QY0135.1/.2     12/01/02
07/27/01               VS1811.1         12/01/03

According to TAGG, only the QV9858.1/.2 confirms have been "executed" with the remainder marked as "sent to counterparty." It is my belief that the deals should have been rebooked to Constellation Power Source, Inc where we have an executed ISDA dated 3/28/01, Global Contract #96057479. In addition, we also have an executed Master Power dated 2/20/01, Global Contract #96061846.

I have also spoken with ICC Energy Corporation, a WMBE counterparty and verified that we do not have any transactions through 8/31/01 with Constellation Energy Source Inc as the ultimate payee.

I think that if we work with the counterparty, they will verify that the deals should confirmed under the ISDA.

Cheryl,

I have reviewed the current contracts and deals in place with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. (CP ID 55358) and found that we have deals extending through 08/31/01.  However, the only current deals are with ICC Energy Corporation (an alternate payee under our contract with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. ).  There are NO current deals with Constellation Energy Source, Inc. at this time.

We currently have two master contracts in place as well as two spot GTCs.  I imagine that we will need to terminate all these agreements, but Legal is unaware of any changes with this counterparty.  Darren, can you please provide Stacy Dickson with the name of your contact at Constellation?  

We also do not have ANY master agreements in place with Constellation Power Source, Inc. - all business (telephonic and EOL) is being covered under GTCs.  Stacy or Debra, do we have any negotiations in place for a master under this name?  Darren, can you work with Stacy on this?

Please let me know if we need to terminate or trade suspend the Constellation Energy Source, Inc. agreements.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Cheryl,

Please do not suspend this CP until my group can review the current contracts in place and any deals that may have been covered by those contracts.  Bridgette Anderson will be looking at this once trading slows tomorrow.  We'll discuss it and get back with you tomorrow afternoon.

Has anyone in Legal heard anything on this?

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

Kurt Wipp is a recent hire in our London office to focus on origination/mid-market opps.  Kurt joins us after 15+ yrs w/ Methanex.  I've asked him to spend next week or so in Houston introducing himself to all the traders, originators, finance, RAC, Legal, etc...  I have given him most of your names and he will probably be contacting you to try and set up some time to meet.  My assistant, Beth Ryan, may also be coordinating some of the meetings.  Please take time to visit w/ him, even if only briefly and help him better understand your markets, perspectives, goals and objectives.  It's important that in addition to Kurt developing an understanding of our business strategies/opportunities that he also develop and accelerate his "Enron DNA."  Thanks in advance!

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

Gerald,

I understand that it takes an enormous amount of time and coordinated efforts to get the Trading Partner Agreements fully executed.  Testing can not begin with the pipelines until a fully executed agreement is on file.  Our deadline to implement EDI for EES is November 1, 2001.   I am concerned that any delays in getting these agreements executed will impact our timeline.

Sarah Dietrich is Sr. Counsel for EES (713/345-7759).    If you could please contact her to work out this issue.

Feel free to call me if you need any assistance on follow through.  Appreciate your help!

Gerald,

Has the Reciprocal Keep Whole and GTC been updated with the changes that are reflected below? Once these changes have been made and approved, can you send the new form to myself and Lisa Hesse/Ellen Wallumrod so that we can get the October confirmation and GTC to Mariner, Spinnaker, Forest, Cohort, and Qwest ?

Thanks,
Judy

Subject: RE: Gas Purchase and Sales Contract


I have reviewed the Keep Whole language that was given to me at our meeting
and find the following:
1.	Refer to para. (ii), next to the last sentence. The word "fail"
needs to be plural.  
2.	Please refer to the second para., 4th sentence. Seller and buyer
need to be reversed. Buyer shall pay Seller.
General Terms And Conditions
1.	Section 1, Transactions - 16th sentence, "...within ten days of
Seller's receipt...", not Buyers receipt.
2.	I understand we will eliminate the use of too many terms used to
describe the quantity. I feel the use of Baseload is sufficient.
I would like to see formal agreements (ie: Confirmation and GT&C)
incorporating the items we have discussed, including 1.) the deduction of
actual costs language 2.) Seller is responsible for all cost(s) upstream of
the delivery point and Buyer is responsible for all cost(s) downstream of
delivery point(s). Sellers right, at it's sole option, to cancel agreement
resulting from buyer's inability to move gas which is caused by Buyer's
transport. (IT or FT).
Thanks for your attention and please contact me should I be of assistance.

		Thank you for your time yesterday. Please find Mariner's
legal input and
		my
		review of the Keep Whole language you provided me.

		Mariner Legal Comments and suggestions:

		1.	Incorporate in each confirmation, as the second
sentence of the
		last
		paragraph in the confirmation: "However, Section 2 of the
GTC shall not
		apply".

		Keep Whole Language comments:

		1.	At, ii, second to last sentence, the word fail
should be plural.
		2.	The first paragraph after (ii), fourth sentence, the
words
		"Seller
		shall pay to Buyer" needs to say "buyer shall pay to
Seller".
		3.	MMBTU needs to reflect a daily quantity unless ENA
intends it to
		be
		a monthly qty. Lets clarify what the official "Baseload
Quantity" will
		be.
		Lets discuss. Will this quantity change before the first of
each month? 

		Thanks for your attention.

You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring basics.  I
have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I should,
however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover all my
mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me guess, Heavy
Metal!

   Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I stayed
   home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He plays
   the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or at
   least
   we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I went
   furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got kinda of
   sick
   of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so
   pathetic
   when people visit.

   Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango
   margarita
   though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

Mary, the last (and only) time I saw these was in a joint meeting with AnnElizabeth and Robert Rose.  Robert actually had these documents, executed and available.  However, the point was raised that one set of the documents was never filed with the courthouse.  If you can get a copy from Robert Rose, you should.  Also, if anyone in legal knows how to check whether they were filed, we should do that as well.
Cheers,
Pat

Dear Patrick:  We are trying to obtain copies of the document whereby Enron Storage Company conveyed the Napoleonville land assets to LRCI, Inc.  They were probably part of the Bridgeline closing documents.  Do you have any documents that support this conveyance?

Please advise.

Thanks,

Gerald:  I think it is an operational problem, because I don't even know what an R6 report is.  I just don't know who handles those filings for LRCI, Inc.--do you?  I could call Juanita Marchand at AEP and ask her who took her place, but I didn't want to call over there if it wasn't necessary.

Hey Gerald,
How you doing.  Gayle and I are having everyone over
for burgers and dogs on the 4th at around 1:30 pm.
We'd sure like you to come if you can.  Beers will be
furnished.  You don't have to bring anything (well,
may be a stripper friend of yours who has loose morals
would be o.k.)  Really, we'd like you to come.  Feel
free to bring a friend if you wish.

Let us know.

Look forward to seeing you....Dan

   You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring basics.  I
   have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I should,
   however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover all my
   mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me guess, Heavy
   Metal!

      Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I
   stayed
      home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He
   plays
      the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or at
      least
      we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I went
      furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got kinda
   of
      sick
      of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so
      pathetic
      when people visit.

      Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango
      margarita
      though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

Yeah, in AEW's eyes everything eventually becomes my problem or fault.  I'll be a monkey's uncle if she ever gave me fully executed conveyance documents that were properly filed with the Clerk of Assumption Parish.  What she probably did give me was an e:mail or a print out of any e:mail of documents designed to effect the Enron Storage Company conveyance to LRCI, buy I'm not even sure that's the case.  

Oh well.  Thanks for following up on the Search.

Hi Mary, 
I don't have a clue who filed the original documents.  I know for a 
fact that ROW did not do the filing for this transaction.  It seems 
to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. 
Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the 
agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I 
think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would 
stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's 
"Enron" files left on EB38.  I don't think I ever saw the 
originals though.

Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to
Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the
transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls
you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.
Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal,
but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might
have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you
have them or know where they are.  
Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document
search.
Best wishes,

Rakhi, please follow up and ensure that we receive payment upon execution of these documents.  It should be done by wire.

A couple of thoughts regarding the redline:
 
1) Scope of Agreement: .."judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations.."  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  "Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council."  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  
 
3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  
 
Give me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.  
(713) 345-8261  
 
thanks.

     Attached is the tpa file , apparently the Standard GISB tpa was "modified' by our legal department and this is what my group has been using ever since.
     I  was given this file when I started here in January of this year.  Please verify that the information is accurate since the original template must have  generated from
     legal and passed on to Gary Payne.  
    I am assuming that Kim Bennick had a template somewhere.

	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",

If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.

the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

If I read this correctly it says that we will not receive the storage permit until close to the end of July. I don't want to let anything else slip. Is there any action required on our part to keep things moving?

Rusty, this is the proposed timetable I sent to Joe for Comment.  I spoke
with him this morning and he agreed to look it over.  He has not yet
reviewed the application. I told him to let me know if there are any
deficiencies in the application when he looks it over. When are you sending
me a copy of the permit application. <<266676_1.doc>>

I also talked to Joe about the possibility of dewatering prior to the final
order.  If needed, Joe said a work permit could be issued which would allow
dewatering.  This is based on a liberal interpretation of the regs, however.

	Hey guys,
	I'm wondering if either of you can locate transaction diagrams for these projects.
	I can't locate any of the ECS working files (don't know what Hilgert did relative to
	the move).  

	Let me know,
	mk

Jean wrote me a sarcastic/funny email that I'll tell you about.  I do finally have a phone though?

Beer/dinner sounds great for Sunday evening.  Let me know what time you'll be back in town and where you want to meet.

Gerald -

Well, I don't have a monitor or a working phone, but other than that everything is going well in my new group.

Do you have plans this Sunday afternoon/evening?  If not, are you interested in grabbing a few beers or something?  My wife is going out of town on business so I won't have anything to do?.

Eric,

Would you please prepare a memo regarding PB-KBB and the work that they are doing.  The memo should include scope of work, amount currently owed, amount to be spend from now until completion and the substance of the conversation that took place today.  I am not looking for a novel but rather something that is concise and can be taken to Don and the cash committee for approval.  I will take what you put together and add some information regarding the importance of getting approval for this contract given our need to complete Cavern #1 in order to satisfy our obligations under the Bridgeline agreements.  Thanks

Stuart

Gerald,
FYI with the attorney at Rusk County Electric Cooperative.  

I'm expecting to be in contact with the Alliant people later today and 
see if we can get any specific comments out of them regarding the 
CSA.  John Gillies indicated yesterday that this "new" Alliant rep
was reviewing the economics of the project yesterday and I know he
has the draft CSA. 

I met with Hanover yesterday to work through the installation and 
coordination now with GE providing all the electric equipment and
maintenance services.  HCC indicated that the Operating Lease
was emailed to me yesterday & I need to find it this morning.  I will
forward to you. 

The maintenance & service agreement from HCC will be somewhat
dependant on their sub-agreement with GE (which will cover the
electric drive system in total) and we should  see language from 
HCC & GE today.  ECS will have (1) agreement with HCC to cover
all the maintenance (bumper to bumper). Jim indicated it will look
like our Bammel agreement with HCC but expanded to accommodate
all the equipment (electrical & mechanical).

Thanks,
mk

Team,

Here is an update on Oakhill:

1.	Ricki said he is sending us a T&D only contract first thing tomorrow morning, he will try to send it before 9 AM but can not guarantee it.  This document will include a T&D price.  When asked if this document will be executable, Ricki said "He thinks so, he'll check on it."
2.	A separate contract for generation only will be sent to us as soon as Ricki has the Ammneded RFP returned.  He has moved the RFP response date to 6/27, and will notify us as soon as he has a response.
3.	Entergy, AEP, and CSW are some of the people bidding on the RFP.
4.	The tax rate on power will be 6.25%.  Ricki will get back to us on the portion of the power cost that taxes should be applied to.
5.	The attorney for Rusk County Co-Op is:
G. Thomas Allison
Tel:   (903) 753-7474

Gerald,
In going through your binders, I find that there is much inconsistency in the way it is set up.  I realize you have been through a few assistants, and we all do it differently.  Do you think you would have a few minutes to chat with me about updating and developing a method to file items in the binders?  I am not sure what the retention period is for the agreements, but there are CAs that are a few years old.  Let me know what you would like to do about this.  Thanks!

Gerald,
Since the agreements with Hubbard were executed by ENA (and not ECS)
is there some assignment from ENA to ECS that we should or need to look
at for post-petition business?  
 
Sounds like they are planning to not pay the delinquent bills but to make 
assurances for the billing going forward.  This is a BIG deal to these small
Cooperatives that we typically work with.  Our load generally represents a 
very large percentage of their total business and they have wholesale providers
that they have to pay.  A couple of our monthly bills could put these guys
into financial distress themselves.  
 
I need to find and read throught the contract with Midland Power before this
gets too far down the road.  I'm out today (Monday) and tomorrow dealing
with some personal stuff with my mom.  Call me tomorrow morning (9 - 10) or we can visit on Wednesday when I'm in the office.

Ultimately we may have to decide if it is more advantageous to pay the pre-petition amounts due or put up whatever deposits/prepayments that may be required to give the utility "additional assurance" of payment of post-petition amounts.  Remember, however, that pre-petition payments will need to be considered in light of the relatively tight baskets imposed by the bankruptcy court and the DIP lenders.

Regards, 

Dave

Subject:        ENA - NNG Hubbard Transaction   - Past Due Amounts payable to Midland Power Cooperative ("Midland") 

Chip/Dave, 

If you will recall, you had me check into whether Midland was a utility under the Bankruptcy Code.  Your thought was that past due amounts to "utilities" had special treatment under the law of bankruptcy.  Gerald and I communicated with David Zdunkewicz of Andrews & Kurth and concluded that Midland is likely a "utility" and that as such, would not be able to stop service for failure to pay pre-petition obligations.  Utilities, such as Midland, are however entitled to request additional assurance of payment.  Our first day bankruptcy order provides such additional assurance by definition, unless a utility counterparty objects in a writing sent to Steve Woods within 30 days of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy (December 2nd).

By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Steve whether he has received any such objection from Midland and, if none has been received to date, to notify myself and Gerald Nemec upon receiving any such objection. 

David Z. suggested that we wait until the expiration of the 30 day period (roughly January 2, 2002) and if nothing is received by that time, just pay invoices which relate to post-petition periods.  We must, however, pay all post petition invoices in a timely manner and it probably makes sense to pre-approve these.

Thanks 

Stuart

	I have decided to sell my entire 401k and spend the money on beer.
If you chip in your 401k, and if we act quickly, I think we could get a full
case of the good stuff.  What do you think about that plan?

Gerald -

I found out today that ENA did not really negotiate the ICE agreement as it was not contemplated at the time that trading would actually take place on the site.  If it is contemplated that ENA Upstream will actually trade on the site, it is possible we will need to negotiate changes to the forms.  Please let me know if ENA UC intendes to trade.

Thanks.

Mark

Yes. These deals should have the same reciprocal keep whole language that Mariner and Forest uses. Gerald Nemec is working on finalizing this new language.

Judy,

I am sorry to be a pest, but may I ask you about the 5% special pending language for: 
Q-West Energy 1065012
Cohort Energy 1068138

What should I use here? Is this the keep whole language proposed for Mariner and Forest?


Also,
One other question,   Swift Energy 1049657 (oct 01),  This shows a customer PF trigger price of $2.12 is the $2.12 the net price or is the net price  $2.12 less  .155 =  1.965

Thanks so much, I hope you had a relaxing time off.

I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.

Chip,

I wanted to follow up regarding the issues that were raised by the cash committee relative to LRCI and our request for approx $300k to pay Dow under our lease on storage caverns #13/#14.

David Zdunkewicz, an A&K bankruptcy lawyer, was asked to consider whether it might be prudent to have the 4 Enron Partners (LRC, LRCI, LGMC, and LGMI) file voluntary petitions in bankruptcy.  The reason to do this would be primarily driven by the flexibility that it would afford the cash committee to fund some of the Enron Partner's liabilities.  It was thought that such a bankruptcy might also have the effect of invalidating the consent right that Texaco currently has on sales of the partnership interests pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.

David indicated, from his firm's preliminary review, that the potential negatives outweigh the possible advantages for the following reasons:

1)  Filing for bankruptcy may result in a claim by Texaco that the partnership agreement is an executory contract and that Texaco could reject any attempt by the Enron Partners to assume the contract.  This would result in a deemed default by the Enron Partners under the Partnership Agreement notwithstanding the absence of any specific default language for a partner's bankruptcy; and 

2)  The rights of Texaco to consent to any transfer of the Enron Partner's partnership interest would not, as previously thought, be invalidated by any bankruptcy.

All of this may be moot as Brian Redmond has secured a preliminary agreement from Bridgeline to pay Dow directly (since they have the obligation to reimburse these amounts anyway).  If that doesn't come to fruition, however, these findings will be important.

Stuart

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently completed a company-wide review of Enron's existing telecommunication operations and related services.

With the execution of this agreement, Enron will receive savings of $18 million over the next two years.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

Gerald,

This is a follow-up to my earlier e-mail about the discovery request from John Haswell, 352-376-5226. Perhaps you have already spoken to him.

I'm traveling today and tomorrow. On vacation next week. I am in the office Friday and reachable much of the week (when not on an airplane). Call when you can.

Good Morning,
    Enclosed is a draft of a GISB for Utility Resource Solutions, LP.  They have done some small physical volumes secured by a pre-pay, but are interested in establishing a more developed relationship.  As such, they want to enter into a GISB with Enron.  This is their copy forwarded through Jay Reitmeyer.  Please review and advise what needs to be done, if anything, to get this executed.  
 
Thanks,

Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re: the
sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .  As
I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above transaction
whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need the
following transaction information:

*	When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
*	Which licenses where part of that transaction?
*	Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
transaction date?
*	Which stations are constructed/operating?

As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the FCC.
To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday at
the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Lisa,

This is the matrix I got from Judy Thorne on which GTCs to use.  Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed?

Based on this, one-day deals will fall under a GTC Spot if we don't have a GISB in place with the producer.  In that instance, we don't need special handling in Sitara.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you find out from Gerald.

When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.

Confirmation Usage		
		
Form	Deal Type	
GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	

Thanks,

Gerald,

As a follow up to your discussion on Friday with Jill Zivley regarding the Aspect/Helmrich & Payne, et al dedicated lease contract #96055540, Jill asked me to coordinate with you to get the amendment to this contract prepared. Per my discussion with Jill, the following items need to be addressed in the amendment.

Add the new well
Change the working interest
Include a statement to address our timing for changing working interest to the month succeeding the month that we are notified
Extend the contract an additional year from the end of the contract term

I will bring you copies of the contract (including the assignment from Enron North America to ENA Upstream) as well as the working interest sheet as soon as I have them. Jill would like to have this contract completed this week since the well is expected to begin flowing any day.

If you have any questions or need anything else on this request, please let me know.

Thanks,
Judy

We plan to provide natural gas to the SPV named below. As I understand, Enron Mexico will be have an equity interest. What credit covenants will we require in the Master Firm Agreement?

Stephanie,

Regarding the phone conversation we had earlier today, we already have the name of the SPV that will be transporting the gas.  It is called
Compa??a Energ?a de Baja s. de R.L. de C.V.

If the best option is to use the North Baja Pipeline, which is only 4 miles from the plant, we would need a gas price at the tie point of our pipeline (the SPV's) with North Baja's plus the 22 cents per MMBtu that will go to Enron's de Mexico Risk Management Group. 

Gas volumes have changed somewhat under the new scenario.  We are now modeling a bigger turbine that consumes 321 MMBtu's per day, which makes a daily total of 7,704 MMBtus per day.

Matt Duffy and I will call you tomorrow to discuss the next steps.
Saludos, 

Victor Gonzalez

	Hey G,

	Haven't heard from you, what's going on?  Things are same 'ol here
at work, am going on vacation to San Antonio next week.  Hey, I'm going to
be in Austin tomorrow for work and am planning to play golf in the
afternoon.  I plan to play at a course that is towards Houston on 290, and
since George works out there somewhere, I thought he might be able to join
in.  Do you have his email and/or phone numbers (work/home)?

	Have you been playing any golf?  We got a new analyst here at work
from UT and he's got got fever.  He got me to play last Friday (my first
time in Houston!) and now I've got the fever again.  My wife is not
thrilled, but.................  So if you play at all, we should hook up.

	Thanks,
	E

	Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a

	     Gerald,

	     Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same
$129
	rate.
	     Below
	     you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
	matters
	     which
	     one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
	They're both
	     on
	     my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

	     I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming
from
	SA.  I
	     estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
	right?)
	     We'll
	     actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's
family
	from the
	     Valley will be there as well.

	     If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting
at
	the
	     hotel
	     sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the
wedding
	together
	     from
	     there.

	     In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we
got
	him a
	     gift
	     yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Can we get the language added to cover the payment due date if it falls on a holiday or weekend?  Per our discussion on 09/26/01, I have set the default in Global Contracts as next following business day, but it's not in writing either in the GTC or the confirmation language.

Thanks,

The last day of the month should be used as the default. We are only changing this date when counterparties have been settling with ENA on a different date.

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Andy,

Per our recent discussions, you will find a proposal from Enron Compression Services to provide HP Services to KNG Energy to meet it growth expectations (either as is or through a new joint venture/ownership structure from the current bidding process).  We have made this proposal to conform with the expansion scenarios outlined in the offering memorandum and have provided flexibility for a 60%-90% load factor to be utilized for both stations.  We would be happy to have a tele-conference to go through this proposal with you.  You will also note that the latter part of the presentation begins to outline additional options (on a notional value basis) that we can put into a deal to increase the value of the deal over the proposed 10-year term.

We took a look at the strategic value of the underlying assets that were offered and were unfortunately not able to come up with a structure that we could support for either the purchase or re-capitalization of KNG Energy's assets.  We appreciate the opportunity to bid on these assets and are happy to work with you to optimize our proposal to fit the ultimate owner's needs for expansion.

I have also attached our group's brochure and a copy of a recent article about our group in Gas Daily.  Once again, thank you for the opportunity and I will call you in the near future to discuss this proposal further.

Chris Hilgert
Director
Enron Compression Services

 
  

The parties hereto understand and agree that the PROPOSAL sets forth each party's preliminary understanding of the proposed transactions with KNG EnerGY and Enron compression services.  This PROPOSAL does not create and is not intended to create a binding and enforceable contract between the parties or a duty on the part of any party hereto to negotiate in good faith toward a binding contract and may not be relied upon by either party as the basis for a contract by estoppel or otherwise, but rather this proposal evidences a non-binding expression of the understanding of each party to endeavor, without obligation, to negotiate the terms of a proposed transaction.

Gerald and Judy,

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.
Lisa  5 4766

Subject:	FW: Bridgeline Application Deficiencies

David, enclosed is an electronic copy of a "deficiency" letter pertaining
the storage permit application.  The deficiencies are minor in nature and
should be easy to remedy.

Robert Morgan and I met with Joe Ball yesterday and had a chance to discuss
the permit application.  The meeting was not planned, but it just so
happened that Joe had recently completed his review of the application.

We also discussed the timeline for a final order approving storage in the
cavern.  Assuming we can provide the information requested in the letter on
or before July 6, we can take the application to hearing on July 26.  After
the hearing there will be a 1 week post-hearing comment period (approx. Aug.
3).  Commissioner's proposed order and findings of fact should be complete
on Aug 10.  Within 7 days the commissioner should send proposed findings of
fact to Natural Resources Committee for review and comment (Aug 17).  The
order will likely be signed no later than the 1st week in September.  It is
possible that it could be as early as the last week in August.

I discussed with Joe Ball the issue of dewatering.  He again said that we
can begin dewatering anytime now upon notice the office of conservation.
Joe interprets the regs to allow us to take steps necessary to "convert" the
cavern from Brine to NG, but we cannot store NG without a permit.  Joe
considers dewatering to be part of the conversion process.

I would not recommend dewatering until we have provided Joe with the
information identified in the attached letter and he has set the matter for
public hearing (probably the first or second week in July).  Joe will not
set the matter for hearing until he considers the project to be technically
sound and in compliance with Statewide Order 29-M.  After Joe has "blessed"
this project, it is unlikely that we will have to do further sonar testing
(which I understand is difficult during dewatering).

Please call me at your convenience to discuss our response to the deficiency
letter.  504-584-9122.

Stacey,

I did have one concern regarding the report. I noticed that several of the counterparties that I noted as needing masters had zeroes for the count of GTC Firm confirms. When I ran a search on them, there were several GTC Wellhead or GTC Pooling Point contracts. Can you check on those counterparties with zero to see why they are not showing contracts?

Judy,

Attached is a very simple report I pulled together on those ENA Upstream counterparties you are trying to get masters in place with.  I ran a Sitara report to check those names against two GTC types that weren't already reported under my regular report:  Committed Reserves GTC and Wellhead Pooling Point GTC.  I'll email you my regular report and I can run something like that in the future once you decide on the threshold levels you'd like to see.

Subject:	RE: GTC clearing report

Judy,

For ENA, we have set thresholds of reporting any counterparty with 100 or more total transactions clearing on online GTCs, 100 or more deals on spot GTCs, and 30 or more deals on Firm GTCs.  While some of these obviously don't apply to ENA Upstream now (online deals), others do.  Do you want to keep the same thresholds or lower yours?  I can create a separate spreadsheet for Gerald to review if you want to have separate, and lower, deal counts.  Please let me know.  I'm getting ready to send out the August report (this is usually done the first week of the month following production).

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Stacey,

I think that is a good idea. I have attached a list of the counterparties that reflect those suppliers that are our highest priority because of the number of transactions as well as other provisions that are negotiated each month. Please let me know if there is anything else that you may need from me.

Thanks,
Judy

Subject:	GTC clearing report

Judy, we currently run a monthly report that we give to Legal showing all counterparties with excess GTCs (both telephonic and online).  We also include credit information and comments regarding the status of any masters we may already have in place with the CP (if applicable).  Since Legal uses this as a tool to see where we really need to focus our negotiating efforts, would you like the report changed to include the ENA Upstream GTCs?  We can then include Gerald Nemec (and any other Legal folks you'd like to add) on the distribution.

Please let me know what you think.  If you'd like the ENA Upstream GTCs included, I will need to work with our IT guy to have the report format changed.  I'll also be happy to send you the August report once I'm done (hopefully today) so that you can see what I'm talking about.

Thanks!

Ok - so here is the latest on Aruba.  We have decided to go through Continental vacations instead of fun jet for 2 reasons.  One, direct flights on Continental to Aruba and two, it is slightly less expensive.  Dates have changed slightly.  We are leaving at 1:30 on Tuesday, Oct. 16 (arrive at 7 ish) and return on Saturday the 20th st 3:30ish.  

If you guys are interested you could do either, wed thru sun on fun jet or tues thru sat on continental vacations.  Dee Espinoza at TAP booked us.  And with either trip, you can cancel up to 24 hours in advance without penalty.

Let me know if you have any questions

Kim

Attached are clean and redline versions of the "without margining" master netting agreement.  The redline is   
just for your review to discern the changes.  
I have also included a clean version without the user notes.  I will distribute a process memo tomorrow.
Please note that even though this does not include margining provisions, the agreement still provides for the reciprocal grant of the security interest in each Group's own payments (see 6 b) and thus, you still need to coordinate with Lech Kalembka at Cadwalader for its perfection.

We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on =
El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect=
 that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court app=
eal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requ=
irements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they=
 are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocation=
s exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 3=
36.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges tha=
t EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the=
 capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from =
any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I thin=
k this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says "any=
" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I w=
ould not advise inserting the usual  "final, non-appealable order" since yo=
u want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be=
 themselves changed by a later order. =20

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the C=
apacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would s=
till make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the =
gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Gerald -  

Where we are on getting the amended CSA executed. When we spoke last - you were going to forward executed copies to me for FGT's signature, so I wanted to make sure they weren't floating around in the inter-office mail or something. 

Thanks, Staci

Bob,
Thanks for the note-I know we can all appreciate the need to speed up the process, but typically, initialling standard agreements is not where the slow down comes-Legal was not aware that the  standard agreements were being treated any differently than those more negotiated. Legal had authorized Donna Greif's group to originate and send out the standard agreement, but Legal's one check of those was to be through the initialing process--I know Shane was aware of this and has made every effort to comply--perhaps you and Barbara should discuss whether the process should be changed going forward, but until that time, all TPA's and their amendments should continue to come to us before execution. 


Thanks very much--
Sandi

Let me clear up this process.

Suzanne is only looking at the TPA's that are standand/model agreements which had been
pre-approved by legal.

If there are any changes to the model that has been approved, then legal will have to sign-off.

If this is unacceptable, please let me know.

We were only trying to help speed up the process.

Suzanne was not initialing as legal, but as operations rep that there were no deviations
from the model agreement.

Hope this helps.

bob

Donna and Shane,
As I mentioned to you previously, Gerald Nemec will be handling the trading partner agreements upon my departure. His extension is  33512. As has been the practice in the past, Gerald should initial all trading partner agreements and any amendments prior to execution by a VP. I understand that Suzanne Calcagno has initialed some of these agreements without authorization from legal and while I understand she has recently received her law degree and awaits bar results, since she is not part of our legal department we would ask that you continue to abide by the procedures we have set in place to come through our legal department  until such time as Barbara Gray authorizes a different procedure. If you have any questions about that please feel free to contact Barbara Gray at ext. 36832.

Thanks and it has been a pleasure working with you!

Gerald, I have attached a term sheet that I would like you to review.

As I mentioned we need to determine which contract we will use for these deals, (dedicated reserves or enfolio).  
In addition, we need to send renegotiation letters to several of the parties.  If you need the list Theresa can provide it.

Let me know your thoughts as soon as you can.

Mark

Stephanie,
 
Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day).
 
I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon.
 
I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January.
 
I am confident that things will run smoother in the future.
 
Regards,
 
Paul

Greetings Paul:
 
Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal. 
 
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
 
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
 
Please advise ASAP.
 
Ragards,
 
Stephanie

Hey guys.  I went to Expedia.com and found the Delta Flights Referenced below for $226/person.  This is still a really good deal and I would jump all over it if I were you.  Here are the flights:

Friday, August 24 Delta #4516 IAH to ATL (departs 10:10am, arrives 1:15pm)
		   Delta #4107 ATL to MYR (departs 2:55pm, arrives 4:36pm)

Sunday, August 26 Delta #4684 MYR to ATL (departs 11:40am, arrives 12:55pm)
		     Delta #2063 ATL to IAH (departs 3:50pm, arrives 4:56pm)

For those of you who don't know how to use Expedia.com.  Just go to the website (www.expedia.com) , search flights from Houston to Myrtle Beach on the above dates and select the flights that work best for you.  You can input your frequent flier number and pay online via credit card.

Good luck and let me know if I can help at all.

Bruce

PS - If you can schedule your flights at the same time, you can share a rental car out of Myrtle Beach, SC as well.  It is about a 40 mile drive north to Ocean Isle, NC . . . site of the wedding.

My Enron 401k quintupled in the last three days.  Wish it had started at $26
instead of 26 cents.  Nevertheless, I am back to using a comma when I write
out the value.  Yippee.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Gerald,

I just spoke with Tina Horn from the Cameron Parish.  They received the letter voiding the original agreement.  She said that since using it for potable water was the only use they had in mind, they won't be needing the ROA to the pipeline.  (Actually, she told me that their engineer had told them that it would be possible to clean the pipeline to the point that it could be used for potable water.)

In light of this, could you please look into the procedures for abandoning the pipeline according to Louisiana law?

Thanks for your help,

Rakhi

Gerald,
Thanks for your input.  We've added a few additional items (highlighted in blue) in the attached Term Sheet (please review).  The LD language is taken primarily from NNG's published FERC gas tariff.  Is this LD language consisent with ENA's Master Firm Agreement?

 

Please advise.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

ISSUES: Counter party creditworthiness, reliability of power delivery, ability to procure replacement power.

Facts: NTEC has an all requirements G & T contract with Rusk. NTEC has contracted to provide firm power to RUSk for Enron's contract, barring force majeure. NTEC has block bid this power on the open market. Bids are due 6/27/01. 

REGULATORY OPTIONS	
1. Alternative Counterparty
(a)SWEPCO: It appears that the franchise for the service territory relevant to this deal is dually certified to both RUSK and SWEPCO (I am working to verify this). If the service territory is singly certified to RUSK, then no alternative counter party is eligible to supply power to the Enron contract. However, if the territory is dually certified to SWEPCO, then SWEPCO could be an alternative counter party for the Enron contract instead of RUSK. That should if applicable, resolve the creditworthiness issue and the ability to have recourse against a substantial counterparty in the event of default.

(b). NTEC:  Enron can enter into some 3rd party contractual arrangement with NTEC and a wholesaler, whereby there is direct pay between Enron and wholesaler, though title technically passes through NTEC. For instance, after the bids come in, Enron can enter into a 3 party arrangement with NTEC and the winning bidder. NTEC is a more substantial counterparty than RUSK and Enron can have recourse against NTEC in case of default.

2. Reliability/Replacement Power: 
(a). Enron can establish onsite DG as back up.

(b) If the DG is offsite, Enron can, depending on the location of the power, self wheel over NTEC or SWEPCO's transmission lines to contract site. However, this may be inefficient due to increased line losses to back the power onto the grid.

(c) Enron can Enter into a backup power arrangement with a wholesale power provider to supply the power required under the Enron contract. Once again, this arrangement must be originated through NTEC, because of its all requirements contract with RUSK.  However, if Enron substitutes power at market price for the NTEC power, Enron will bear the cost of the higher priced power. NTEC has a long term partial requirements contract with SWEPCO, thus their power is much cheaper than market priced power.

3. Deregulation Options
(a) RUSK opts out of Deregulation: Senate Bill 7, Sec. 41.052, states  that an Electric Coop that chooses not to opt in to retail choice "retains the right to offer and provide a full range of customer services and pricing programs to the customers within its certificated retail service area and to purchase and sell electric energy at wholesale without geographic restriction."

Depending on the value of this deal and the outstanding term of Rusk's contract with NTEC, Enron can persuade Rusk to renegotiate that contract or buy NTEC out. Enron can then step in as the wholesale supplier of power to RUSK.

(b) RUSK opts in to deregulation: Enron can persuade RUSK to opt in to retail competition under an arrangement whereby Enron guarantees to RUSK that their current rates will remain at a predetermined stable position. The downside is that there may be minimal stranded cost issues, and the upside will be that RUSk can market to customers outside its sevice territory yielding potentially higher revenues.

Questions: 
1. What are the terms and conditions of the contract between RUSK and NTEC, what are RUSK's termination or renegotiation rights; and 
2. What are the terms and conditions of the contract betweenNTEC and the wholesale supplier.

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a "Discussion Document" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

I have spoken with Robert Tilotta with the Ad Valorum Tax Group, and he said that in general all ad valorum taxes for 2000 have been paid.  He is going to pull the payment information.  I will keep you updated.

Since the total book value for the 354.36 acres of land is 1,434,968.64, then each acre is worth $4,049.47.  The amount for the tract being sold is 1,336,811.04 (330.12 @ $4,049.47)

Ana, 

Per our conversation earlier today:

Our survey shows the tracts we are selling consist of 330.12 acres.  For the purpose of the DASH, we need to have a precise book value for those 330.12 acres, so I need to confirm with you one final time the book value for that land.  

Also, the draft agreement for the land sale stipulates that all ad valorem taxes bearing against the property due and payable through 2000 have been paid.  Before we sign the agreement, we need confirmation from you that this is the case.  

Since we are trying to close this deal tomorrow (11/20), I would appreciate a quick response.  Thanks for your cooperation.

You are correct sir.  DJ is a man among 18 to 22 year old boys.  He has that
same "special something" that we saw in Vasher and Roy last year.  He will
be a good at UT for as long as he chooses to stay.

I'll be looking for at the game . . . shouldn't be hard to find you among
the other 200 people in attendance.

Rude-Dog, Enron is still treating me like a baby treats a diaper!  Just
kidding.  Things are going fairly well and have gotten pretty busy
within the last couple of weeks.  Still trying to recharge the
girlfriend pipeline on the weekends.  Kinda of in a dry spell right now.
Oh well at least my life isn't complicated.  Glad to hear things are
going well for you.  Yes the days of surfing Longhorn boards for 3 to 4
hours a day are over.

I am really getting comfortable with our DTs actually.  Maurice Gordon,
even though undersized has wreaked a lot of havoc. He crushed Curry in
the endzone for the safety.  Sounds likes Tubbs is picking up the double
teams (ala Casey Hampton) which allows Gordon more room to work.  He is
very quick and can get to the backfield quickly.

Mark my words, Derrick Johnson is our best linebacker Now!!!  Watching
him against NC was a joy.  He toys with the lineman and makes them look
silly when he jukes and blows past them.    The guy needs to be starting
now.  I know he has only played two games, but I haven't seen a more
talented linebacker play at UT since I began watching Longhorn football.

The game against UH is national on ESPN2, I believe.  You should be able
to catch it.  Watch #11 on Defense.  Look for me in the stands.  I be
the one wearing burnt orange.

Ana, 

Per our conversation earlier today:

Our survey shows the tracts we are selling consist of 330.12 acres.  For the purpose of the DASH, we need to have a precise book value for those 330.12 acres, so I need to confirm with you one final time the book value for that land.  

Also, the draft agreement for the land sale stipulates that all ad valorem taxes bearing against the property due and payable through 2000 have been paid.  Before we sign the agreement, we need confirmation from you that this is the case.  

Since we are trying to close this deal tomorrow (11/20), I would appreciate a quick response.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Gerald,

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreements for Public Service Company of Colorado ("PSCo") and Cheyenne
Light, Fuel and Power ("CLF&P").  I apologize for the delay.  Our comments
are as follows:

Public Service Company of Colorado Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $20,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.6 be $25,000,000 as to each of our companies.

2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change "may" to "shall".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize if PSCo
or CLF&P acted as Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose
that the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the
parties be deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited
to be applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering
Event and the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the
Agreement.

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
"establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice."

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase "or deemed to be repeated".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, neither PSCo nor CLF&P is
authorized to contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.
Please delete all references to Affiliates of PSCo or CLF&P in the
respective Agreements.

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert "provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, "which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld".
Please modify this provision accordingly.

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard.

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:

	"Material Adverse Change" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
"Credit Support Provider" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below "BBB-" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
"Baa3", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.

Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power Company Agreement

Our comments with respect to this Agreement are identical to those stated
above regarding the PSCo Agreement, with the following exceptions:

Section 4.2. Triggering Event.  The dollar levels near the end of the
Section should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make each
$75,000,000.

Section 4.7.  Collateral Requirement.  Similarly, the dollar trigger levels
in this provision should be equivalent between our companies.  Please make
each $25,000,000.

Except for the foregoing, please make changes to the Cheyenne Agreement
consistent with our comments to the PSCo Agreement as set forth above.
Should you have questions or wish to discuss any of our requested changes,
you may contact me via return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.


Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to
finalize these Agreements.

Hey Gerald,
Just wanted to let you know I have followed up with the past due amount of around $12,000.  I contacted both a/p departments; the invoice is currently still outstanding.  Angie from Katz Kutter is faxing me the detail.  I will bring it to your attention when I receive it in order to issue payment.  Thanks!

Hi Gerald,

I didn't get a copy of the new Committed Reserves/First Purchaser GTC from you last night.  I didn't know you if you forgot or if there was a problem with the email, so I thought I'd ask again.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

Gerald,  I hate to do this to you, but Carlos is out of the office until tomorrow and we need to get Ben Jacoby's signature on the attached letters before he leaves today at 1:30.  Please review the attached letters (I do not believe they should refer to ENA who is apparently not a party to the agreement that is being terminated).  Please advise.

Kathleen

Carlos,

The TRANSCO Precedent Agreement termination date is coming up (August 3, 2001).  Attached, please find drafts of the letter to terminate.  Please provide any comments.

We need to be ready to send in this letter by the end of the week via FedEx if we can not get the Termination Date pushed out one or two months at a minimum.

I spoke with TRANSCO today and they indicated that we should know tomorrow AM if extending the termination date for a couple of months will be possible.

Thanks.


RDG

Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will tell
you this...the President told the military to be ready.  We are.

I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out here.
Take care.  Paul.

Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on "Outlook Today" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on "View" and
	then "Folder List")

2.	Left Click on "Properties" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the "Permissions" tab

4.	Left click on "Add".
	Type "EWS"-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the "Add" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click "OK"

5. 	You should now be back in the "properties" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the "Shift" key, then
	left click all the other ID's.  With all IDs now selected and not holding the Shift key down, click in the boxes which
	access you would like to allow the temporaries to have.  (Note:  Do not select anything that has "own" or "owner"
	in it as you are the owner.)  Left Click on "Apply", then "OK".

6.	Right click on your "Calendar" folder and repeat steps 2-5 above.

7.	[Optional].  To give access to e-mail or any other folders you may have, right click on that folder and repeat steps
	 2-5 above.

Regarding the Legal Temp IDs, these set-up instructions need to be completed only once. If your Assistant ever changes, these instructions will come in handy!
Thank you for your time and patience.

Gerald, 

I understand that you will be taking on some of Sandi's projects since she left the company.  I have been working with Sandi on an agency agreemtent between ENA and Tenaska IV Partners, related to the gas supply for the Cleburne Plant.  Has she brought you up to speed on what we need?  We are looking into selling our stake in the plant and need to finalize the agreement as soon as we can.  Please let me know what you need to finish this.  Thanks.

Daren

Lisa,  My only comments would be in the Firm Transport section.  Since ENA can not directly provide firm transport on NNG, I would rephrase it as "ENA would arrange for Firm Transport on NNG".  As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements).

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Kindly issue an amendment to our out-going guaranty for the benefit of Tractebel Energy Marketing, Inc., executed in May 2000.  We are requesting an increase to $10.00MM.

The increase is to provide support to an existing deal and the counterparty would like to have this amendment as soon as possible.

Just to let you know, I scheduled a meeting with Roger Westbrook on this Thursday, Sept 27 at 2 pm.  If it's okay with you, we can just meet in your office at that time.

The two main issues to discuss are the plat and legal description for Sorrento and the Bridgeline-Crawfish agreement.

Please let me know if this doesn't work for you.

Talk to you soon,

Have you heard anything from Gerald about the contracts?  The deal is almost
over and we still do not have any contracts executed.  Hope you can get this
thing unstruck and moving forward again.

Dave, let's discuss.. Jay, I know that this does not represent the definative agreement but as a starter we would easily do part 1, and part 2 is where the complicated issues lie.

We clearly need to understand the contractual arrangements they have with the third party.... if we go with part 2.  Dave, what are their plans to liquidate their july position? Do they have any hedges on now?  What generation asset are they delaying... ( important info). Get ENA a copy of all purchase and sale agreements including ( executed copies/originals). Make sure that they do not have confidentiality issues related to the confirms... If they do not, then we can look at them... if they do have CA issues then Gerald is advising me that they will need the consent of the seller to let ENA look at agreements.

Subject:	ENA to ENA Upstream Master

We now have a fully executed Master Firm Purchase/Sale contract between ENA and ENA Upstream. I am forwarding the originals to Gerald Nemec, and he will get a copy sent to you. The confirmation language states that "Any Transaction may be formed and effectuated (i) by a written paper-based Transaction Agreement executed by the Parties...or (ii) in a recorded telephone conversation between the Parties..." Therefore, per Gerald, we can discontinue preparing paper confirmations between the two Enron entities.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Judy

I've located the Gas Nomination information that was prepared for Dec. 01 and updated to include Jan. 02 business.
The Dec.01 numbers differ slightly from the initial numbers generated by James Centilli at TW as well as the numbers
that Stephanie Miller conveyed in her Dec. 18th memo.  

These values are based on the nomination worksheets & actual power bills from he respective utilities.

          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Stephanie,

Because of the current litigation between Enron and PG&E, I had to get it approved with Bill and Legal.  I'll follow up to see where it is and let you know as soon as I hear something.

Everything is going great over here.  We're really busy.  Come on over some
time and we'll give you the grand tour.  The varsity is on the 11th floor
of the Metro Building (Louisiana Place).

I caught the tail end of Wild At Heart last Sunday on the IFC channel ...
always awsome.  I got a satellite dish for my Father's Day present and
picked up some new channels including the Independent Film Channel and the
Sundance Channel

Well, back to work.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Hey Gerald,

I was speaking with Tyrell up in Denver, and apparently Kennedy Oil sent us their signed payment 2 document, but it has been lost in the mail.  Would you mind sending up an electronic copy of that letter to Tyrell, so he can get signatures?

Thanks.

Phil

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

Gerald -

Well, I don't have a monitor or a working phone, but other than that everything is going well in my new group.

Do you have plans this Sunday afternoon/evening?  If not, are you interested in grabbing a few beers or something?  My wife is going out of town on business so I won't have anything to do?.

JK

Dear All,

I realize the final decision to move these deals have not been made. Judy Thorne is meeting with Hunter Shively in the morning, we might have some more information then.
Anyway, I thought it would be a good idea for all of us to get together to discuss what needs to happen if/when the deals are moved before the fact rather then after.

Lets still meet tomorrow, then if nothing else we can come up with a list of contract and operational issues that we can present to the commercial heads....right?

Ellen

Sorry, I'm already booked with Volume Management at that time.  I've spoke with George to get the latest decisions on what's happening to the Appalachian deals.  There seems to be a few open items and the effective date for moving these deals is undetermined.  He feels, we should hold off on having this meeting till the actual effective date has been set?  He should be hearing something in the next week or two.

Sounds like I need to take gambling lessons from you.  I consistently lose money when I gamble.   
 
 Do you have Tristan's email address?  Wanted to see if we could hook up in Austin for some Longhorn celebration.

The weekend was a blast.  I won $116 at the craps table (I'm addicted now and my dad thinks I need to join gamblers anonymous).  We kayaked on the Colorado River - about 11 miles - on Saturday and the weather was spectacular.  And we hiked the Grand Canyon on Sunday - an amazing site!  It reminded me of a spontaneous college road trip.  We had a lot of fun.  Let's talk about another football game in the future or go get drinks sometime.  
 
Have a good week!

I was in Austin for most of the weekend.  A friend of mine was supposed to have a boat party on Lake Travis Friday night, but that was cancelled due to the rain.  We just went out on 4th Street instead.  Went to the game Sat. night.  We won so that was good.  How was the girls road trip?

Hi.  I just wanted to let you know that the conference I was going to attend in Austin next week was cancelled and the organizers of the conference are now defunct.  Oh well.....I think I'll pass on going to Austin for the game.  I need a weekend at home to myself after SC and the Vegas/Grand Canyon adventure.  
 
Did you enjoy the long weekend?

If these changes are acceptable to you, Greely would be willing to sign all the contracts.  You know for the deal we have been flowing gas on since April.  

Paul

PS  Only 7 more days!

Paul,
Sorry this has taken so long, but I finally got feedback from John on these
contract documents.   Here is the status of the following documents:

Release of Capacity and Agency Agreements - sending you this back with two
suggested changes in the first section (Scope of Agreement) and additional
language in sectin 5 (Agency).

Transaction Agreement - I am ready to sign off on this document and present
it to Gordon for his signature.

Enfolio Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement - sending it up to Legal for
thier initials.  The Legal people sined off on the draft, so this should not
be a problem.


	 <<Greeley Letter Enron Agreement1.doc>>

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Also, I have notified and
awarded the gas contracts  in Colorado covered under the last RFP Greeley
sent out.

Also, on another note.  Are you aware of the scheduled maintaince on CIG at
Ft. Lupton and Young Storage in August?  Greeley had a message from CIG
about some scheduled maintaince at Ft. Lupton that would prohibit storage
injections.  I believe that this was scheduled to last approximately two
weeks.  Please let me know if this is going to cause Enron any problems in
Filling the Young Storage.

Thanks....Robert

Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!

Thanks, 

Kim

Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.  I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful.

Just found out right after I got off the phone with you that I am no longer
going to see Madonna.  We couldn't give the guy a definite yes and he had to
go ahead and sell the tickets.  Yikes.  I think I am going to kill myself.
Was it bad luck talking with you??

Ha! Ha!

Anyway, I enjoyed talking with you!  Have a good time in S. Carolina this

  Just fyi, the El Paso and Mojave tpas were initiated by Karen and I do not have an electronic copy. All I have is the hard copy.  I have communicated the changes to her and asked her to send me a revised copy.

Shane,  After reviewing the Mojave TPA, I contacted Carlos Pena with El Paso to discuss.  He agreed that Section 3.2(B) can be stricken.  He also agreed that the Sentence In Section & on Page 10 which reads "Text from here to the end of item 7 has been inserted by Enron North America Corp." is a note which should be stricken.

Also for consistency sake, Section 3.2(B) in the main body of the agreement should not be stricken.  Exhibit A overrides this Section so the strike is not necessary in the main body of the Agreement.  

Lastly,  the full legal name "Enron North America Corp." should be inserted in the agreement.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Afternoon,
    I was able to go through Colorado Springs financials, but was unable to distinguish between natural gas system operations and the general "utility", outside of book value of the various gas, electric and water plants.  As such, if we are unable to acquire statements for the gas system itself, I don't think we can agree to CSU's redline of Scope of Agreement (point # 1 below).

Max,  The agreement calls for them to provide to ENA certification that they have set aside special funds to meet their payment obligations to ENA under this agreement.  A letter from the mayor or city manager indicating such budget approvals are sufficient.  To the extent they don't provide this, an Early Termination event occurs.  We can still call for collateral in accordance with Section 4.5 if they don't meet the thresholds.  The item added in your Sentence #1 below does concern me.  This seems to be a floated revenue system and I am not sure how we get comfortable that the revenues will be there.  I need to review these additions with Colorado Springs, because it is not clear to me how they think such provisions operate in the context of the existing language concerning the budget certification requirements.  We probably need to get on a conference call with them.
 
I am probably OK with the arbitration provision, depending on how the other items turn out.
 
Tyrell,  do you want to set something up a call with Marcus and his attorney to discuss these issues?

A couple of thoughts regarding the redline:
 
1) Scope of Agreement: .."judgement resulting from this Agreement shall be made only from the revenues received from Customer's natural gas system operations.."  I need to re-review the financials to determine how much the gas system operations is worth.  Because of this clause, $15mm in credit may be too much.  Once I can get on the net, I'll review.
 
2) Scope of Agreement:  "Furthermore, in accordance with the Colorado Springs City Charter, performance of Customer's obligations.....expressly subject to appropriation of funds for such purpose by the City Council."  In case we are in a position to call for margin, what is the process of getting it?  Do they have to get permission / authorization from the city, etc..? Tyrell had asked me the process how we call and what we accept for margin, but I'd like to understand the ease and/or difficulty of receiving margin from them.  We may never hit the threshold, but if we do and we can't get margin, we may have a big problem.  
 
3) Gerald, I assume you're ok with the arbitration clauses?  
 
Give me a call if anyone wants to discuss further.

thanks.

Gerald and Mary,
 
While I am out, I may need your help on this and other "so called" Project Neptune matters.  These are clean up matters that Ann Elizabeth White was handling for Patrick Johnson, Brandi Morris and Rakhi Israni.  All my files on these Louisiana/Bridgeline related matters are in my left hanging file behind the  Tab labeled "Project Neptune"
 
Thanks,
 
Steve

Please let me know your timing on the Sorrento Pipeline matter I forwarded to you Saturday.  As you can see from the following, Sorrento is a bit anxious.  I will be out Wednesday through next Tuesday, so it would be great if we can touch base before then.  Please give me a call when you have a chance.

Gerald, we recently placed a $50,000 bond for HPL for Franchise Tax Certification for you.  

I understand from our broker, John L. Wortham that our surety, St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine was informed that Marsh USA will be handling the HPL bonds effective 06-01-01 (please see attached email).

I am attaching a list of outstanding bonds that HPL has in place.   Should these bonds be canceled? Or if these bonds are still required, you may wish to consider placing with your new agent of record, Marsh USA.  They can either be replaced all at once or just prior to expiration. 

Please note while most of the bonds were placed with St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine there are a couple that were placed with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.   

Please let me know how you wish to handle the outstanding bonds.. Thanks.  

If you have questions, please give me a call 713 853-5687.

Mary, we have received information from Roger Bumgarner at St. Paul/Seaboard that Marsh USA has been appointed agent of record effective June 1, 2001 on the HPL bonds he writes.

As you know, there are three bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two through Insurance Company of North America.  I presume we will  be receiving notice that Marsh has been appointed on them, also.   However, we have not yet received information to that effect.

Greetings:

Gerald advised that we will need to raise a new master with CNRL to accomodate the transfer of capacity and the associated agency arrangement.  Can you please send the existing paper to him to use as a guide? Gerald's phone no. is 713-853-3512.

Also, PGT needs to make a manual adjustment to the releases - therefore they need the deals loaded and ready to go before the 1:00 CST deadline. We don't want to wait till the last minute in case there are other "fixes" that need to be done.

Please call Kim Olinger ASAP - 713-853-7504. She has everything ready - just waiting on your direction.

Regards,

Stephanie

Have we put this to bed yet?
 
How about the easement across our property?  Where do we stand on that?

Eva, 

FYI - I called Mary Ogden today to follow-up on the status of the Napoleonville Land sale document filing (sale to TX Brine).  Mary said that she is still trying to locate the document(s).  She plans to finalize in one of two ways:  

1.  Our lawyers in Louisiana are going to send someone this week to check the Assumption Parish records (to see what was actually recorded);

2.  Mary sent an e-mail to a former Enron Landman (now AEP), Robert Rose.  Ann Elizabeth told Mary that Robert may have a copy of the document(s).

Thanks, Lisa

Mary, 

Would you call AEW and find out where we can find a copy of the Tract 5B sale from Enron Storage Company to LRCI, Inc. here in our office--I know you are planning to call Sandi Braband; according to the message below, AEW must have done the work.

Also, would you please call Keith Daigle (I don't want to use Locke Lidell on this) and ask him to obtain a file stamped copy of "all" ESC conveyances to LRCI that are filed in the Assumption Parish Records.  Keith's phone number is 504-830-3990 or 985-898-1909.

Would you also ask Keith how he is coming on the Sorrento Right of Way Agreement that I sent him on July 7.  We need to have that back by the time Patrick Johnson returns next Monday.  Please give him a "gentle" prod. 

Thanks, 

Steve

Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows: 

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine: 

Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 


Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A: 

Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds? 


Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

In a continuing effort to align the legal groups with the business groups, the Power Trading and East Origination/Gas Trading Groups have merged to form the Energy Group of the Wholesale Legal Department.  The Energy Group will be co-headed by Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager.
While the work handled by the new group will be essentially the same work handled by the predecessor groups, the new structure will give more opportunity for training across the commodities.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Fellow Diver:

Well, it's been a while, but we have been busy.  Here's a brief rundown on what's been happening.  In the United Kingdom PADI received some great exposure for the PADI Seal Team Program when the BBC's children television series Blue Peter did a whole segment on the Scouts in the UK taking up the Seal Team program.  Here is a link to the Scout website so you can learn more; http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/activity/outdoor/adventure/scubascout.htm

Speaking of the PADI Seal Team, they made an appearance in October at the Scuba Extasea Expo in Denver, Colorado, USA.  They were signing autographs and having a great time.  Shina, Blade, Kiros, Daria and Alano even had their pictures taken with real-life U.S. Navy Seals.  It was great.

By now, you should have received two special Fellow Diver newsletters inviting you to bring three friends into scuba diving and receive a $50.00 check from PADI.  I'm happy to report that the program is a big success!  The scuba industry at large is jumping on the bandwagon developing associated offers for those of you who show them your PADI check.  We will be doing our best to keep track of the many offers so that we can keep you informed.  Please keep checking the PADI website and be on the look out for more special newsletters.

I did receive quite a few e-mails about the PADI Diving Society.  Currently, there are two PADI Diving Societies. One is based in the US and the other is based in the UK and serves that region. The official publication of the PADI Diving Society in the US is Sport Diver magazine. I encourage you to visit their site at; www.sportdiver.com to learn more about Society membership and the magazine. And, PADI Diving Society members receive another $25.00 from Sport Diver when three friends or family members receive their PADI Open Water Diver certification. Sport Diver also has a great email newsletter you can receive for free. Just drop in and register online at http://www.sportdiver.com/idiver

The holidays are quickly sneaking up on us.  So what scuba-related gift can you give your friends or family?  Here is an idea.  We recently added cool post cards to the padi.com website.  One is a gift certificate for $10.00 off the PADI Open Water Diver course.  Send friends or family members the post card and when they follow the simple directions and complete the Open Water Diver course, they get $10.00 directly from PADI.  Just follow this link: www.padi.com/fun/postcard2  And don't forget to wish them happy holidays.  It's a nice gift that doesn't cost you a thing.

If you happened to be in the Cayman Islands the first week of November, you might have met Michelle.  "She" was the hurricane that came blowing through literally hours before PADI Diving Society's Total Submersion Event.  Despite this, Sunset House, a PADI Gold Palm Resort, and the event's host hotel did an incredible job of making everyone feel at home.

If you were at Total Submersion, you would have seen something unusual. Me diving next to a mermaid! That's right, I dove the Mermaid off Sunset House and have pictures to prove it!  Take a look at http://www.padi.com/padi/offices/americas/news/mermaid/. Despite the initial bad weather, more than 70 people had a fabulous week.  Please consider joining us next year at this fantastic event.  Details will be posted on the PADI website as they become available.

I know this is getting a little long, so until next time, get a friend (or three) and go diving. And, drop me a line to let me know about your latest dive adventure.

Please ignore that last email.  I see where the language was added under Section 6.  My apologies.

Can we get the language added to cover the payment due date if it falls on a holiday or weekend?  Per our discussion on 09/26/01, I have set the default in Global Contracts as next following business day, but it's not in writing either in the GTC or the confirmation language.

Thanks,
SBR

The last day of the month should be used as the default. We are only changing this date when counterparties have been settling with ENA on a different date.

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Shane,
	Sandi has initialed Tennessee's TPA form because of time restraints, but asked that this form be worked on in the future. Had she had time before the move, Sandi would have liked to change this form before initialing on ENA and ENA Upstream's behalf. Sandi called John discussing her concerns, therefore, if you have any questions, John may know the answers.  
	Two originals are being sent to your attention for further execution.  If you have any questions, please call me at x35231.

Thank You,
Kim Bennick

In light of the tragic events in New York City and Washington, DC, there is a national call for blood donations.  Enron is taking two actions:

	1.	The City of Houston is sponsoring a city-wide blood drive at the George R. Brown Convention Center today.  For your convenience, Enron is providing transportation to and from the Convention Center from 9am-3pm.  Transportation will be leaving from the Enron Building every half hour.  We have been informed that there is a 3 - 4 hour wait.  

	2.	Enron's regularly scheduled blood drive is being held on Thursday, September 13, from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m.  Two mobile units from the M. D. Anderson Blood Center will be parked outside the Enron Building on Andrews Street to accommodate donors.  Call the Enron Health Center at ext. 3-6100 to schedule an appointment.  Information regarding Enron's blood drive program and eligibility criteria is location on the Wellness webpage http://hrweb.enron.com/wellness/healthService/bloodDrive.asp 

Our latest information is that three busloads of Enron employees have already been taken to the Convention Center and many of you have already scheduled appointments for Thursday.  We commend all of you for your community spirit.

	Gerald,

	I wanted to get you started on this ASAP as we discussed.  I don't expect a finished product but 
	preferr that you initiate the draft and I'll work with it as necessary in you absence.  Thanks for you
	cooperation.

	I have attached a summary of the Parking Provision and the CSA in addition to the Term Sheet
	that is dated but you get the idea.

FYI . . .  The attached order on the territorial dispute was issued 12/21.  The time frame for WFEC to file a motion for reconsideration of Order No. PSC-2499-FOF-EU with the FPSC expires on Monday, January 7, 2002 (15 days from the date of the order is Saturday, January 5, 2002, therefore the time for filing is extended until the next business day).  If a motion for reconsideration is filed, we have 7 days in which to serve a response.  The time period for
pursuing an appeal to the Florida Supreme Court is tolled until the FPSC disposes of any motion for reconsideration.  If no motion for reconsideration is filed, then the time frame for filing a notice of appeal to the Florida Supreme Court expires Tuesday, January 22, 2002 (30 days from the date of the order is Sunday, January 20, 2002, and Monday, January 21,
2002 is a holiday, therefore the time for filing a notice of appeal is extended until the next business day).

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Lisa,
Here is the deal as it stands with each counterparty:

Texas Brine
Wayne Sneed--Treasurer, the main contact, his number is 713-877-2661
Ted Grabowski--President and CEO, 713-877-2716
Sale Agreement--The "Cash Sale Form" is drafted, no changes needed, Gerald can get executable copies ready right away
Easements Agreement--We would like to delay execution if possible, but Gerald can have executables in place fairly quickly if they insist
DASH--written, requires signatures, beginning with Dave Gorte.

I will call Wayne in the morning and tell him to remain on standy. We'll know fairly quickly where we are when Reliant calls us tomorrow morning around 10:30, and I can tell him before my flight leaves.   If the Reliant deal is off, we can start moving right away on this.  I'll tell him to be in touch with you regarding document delivery and cash transfer.  

Reliant
Ken Bradley--VP Energy Wholesale Group, main contact, his office number is 713-207-1456.  He tends to be easier to reach on his cell, 713-805-3889.
Sale Agreement--The "Act of Sale" is drafted and just needs to have the new pricing put in, at which point we can get executables and signature.
Board Resolution--Drafted and submitted to Reliant, we expect they will not have issues with it and we can get executables on what we have.
Corporate Guaranty--Has been executed for $3MM.  Gerald has the original.  For ease of execution we will try to get Reliant to accept it at $3MM even with a higher sale price, but if pressed we will have to get another one signed for the amount of the sale.  I believe Clement Abrams will take care of that, but check with Gerald.
Certificate of Non-Foreign Status--Signed by Stephen Douglas, I have left you the original (for Reliant, I assume) and 2 copies (for us)
DASH--written, but will require ran update for new pricing.  Need to show Gorte one last time, get his signature, and then it needs the rest of the signatures.

Ken will be calling us back around 10:30 tomorrow immediately after his meeting with whomever can authorize a higher price, he has all our numbers so if he can't reach me he will call Jean directly in Buffalo.  If we get a suitable price ($3.25 MM or higher), then the next step is to get them comfortable with the guaranty we have executed, then get the DASH signed and move on from there.  In my previous email, I told him you would be involved, so I'll put him in touch with you as soon as we have a deal. 

The wiring instructions for either party are as follows:

Account name: 		ECT Cash Services Acc. Entity
Bank Name:     		Citibank New York
Account Number : 	40781075
Routing Number :	021000089

Reliant already has these instructions.  Either party may want to cut a check instead, it just becomes a question of which is faster and easier.

I will forward you the latest copies of all the documents for each party as separate emails.  As far as signatures are concerned, Julie Gomez told me she would be in on Wednesday and availabe to sign, but Jean may want to handle it via fax.  That can be decided tomorrow.  I will list out the rest of the needed signatures in the respective emails. 

Well, try as I may, I'm sure there are issues I have not covered, so feel free to call me at any point at the phone numbers I sent earlier.  Good luck and THANKS for helping us out!  

Eva

Gerald,

Does LCDR mean Lieutenant Commander?  On my last email his title was LT, just
lieutenant.  I guess that means our boy has been promoted......

The Horns weren't too impressive on Sat.............I was going to go to the
Colorado game, but I think I might skip now, seems like the whole season is
shot.........

The attorney with the most complete knowledge on the Bammel Trust monetization would be Mary Cook, 5-7732.  She covered both legal and regulatory fronts, using outside counsel at Vinson & Elkins and Clark, Thomas and Winters (Austin).  She may be able to tell you who is still here at Enron that covered the Accounting, Treasury, Logistics and other fronts.

As I have taken a job with Enron Industrial Markets, Jeff Hodge will be allocating my work responsibilities to other attorneys who serve Enron Upstream.  Gerald Nemec is currently handling all Compression Services work and some storage matters for Eva Rainer.  Although he's quite busy at present, Jeff may decide that he has the best skill set to assist with a transaction of this type.  While he did not work on the latest Bammel Trust transaction, through his work on the Looper transaction and the various compression projects, he has gained expertise in similar transactional structures.

Good luck,

Steve Van Hooser

Steve,	

One of the major clients we are talking about the base gas monetization is TXU.  We had a meeting with them last week and we are currently in the process of getting them to sign the CA (which was prepared by Mary Ogden).  One the advantages that we have with this transaction is the fact that it is state regulated and also that we have the experience of having done something similar with Bammel.  Now I'm putting together our execution plan and want to learn who worked on the Bammel transaction from the legal and regulatory side, so that we may understand the issues faced then.  I would like to chat with you and get your thoughts on this, please let me know when we could get together.

Thanks

Miguel

Gerald,

We want to do a transaction with Falcon Gas where we provide them with base gas for pressure in their facility.  We basically would park gas in their facility until Jan./04 to provide pressure.  We are making two (mutually exclusive) proposals.

Proposal 1:
Park 2 Bcf of gas on October and November 01 (33,000/day), this gas would be delivered at the Lone Star WA line where it connects to the Hill Lake storage facility (Hill Lake is building a lateral that would connect to the bigger and better connected Lone Star's "X" line, this will be ready by the time we pull out our gas).
Redeliver the gas to ENA at the interconnect of the Falcon lateral to the "X" line on January 04 (66,000/day).  The redelivery would be done all in one month (the lateral and compressors would be in place to allow for delivery in one month).

Proposal 2:  Same transaction as #1 except that:
We may get the option to convert 10% of our base gas to working gas (and therefore withdraw it) on the previous January (03).

Please let me know if you want to meet to talk about the details.  I'm attaching the draft term sheet for your review and editing (it is pre-credit but post desk pricing).

Jean,  We have appointed three new directors for LRCI, Inc.  They are yourself, Mark Haedicke, and Brian Redmond.  The records show the current directors as Mark Haedicke and Louise Kitchen, but we were unable to find any resolutions supporting this.  We will clean the records up to reflect the new directors.  Since you and Brian are on the management of Bridgeline, it is a more logical fit for you to be directors.  The resolutions for the Napoleonville Land Sale with the new directors are being circulated for signature.  You may have already seen it.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

As both of you are well aware, ENA currently owes Midland Power Cooperative ("MPC") past due amounts for power delivered pursuant to an Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 by and between ENA and MPC, as amended.

I am working with Chip and Dave to determine if we can pay the past due amounts.

Two questions need to be answered ASAP:

1)  Is there any other entity that might be able to supply the power if ENA defaults under its agreement with MPC?  
2)  Is MPC considered a "utility"?  Dave has learned that "utilities" cannot refuse to serve entities in bankruptcy on a going forward basis for failure to pay pre-petition obligations (so long as adequate assurances of future payments are provided).  Gerald, you might need to consult with one of the bankruptcy lawyers to see how this determination is made.  

Please respond at your earliest possible convenience.

Thanks

Stuart

Judy,

I'm not sure why the GTC Pooling Point contracts were not picked up, so I reran the Sitara reports.  The reports appear to be correct now, so please review and let me know if you have any other suggestions.

 

Thanks,

Stacey,

I did have one concern regarding the report. I noticed that several of the counterparties that I noted as needing masters had zeroes for the count of GTC Firm confirms. When I ran a search on them, there were several GTC Wellhead or GTC Pooling Point contracts. Can you check on those counterparties with zero to see why they are not showing contracts?

Judy,

Attached is a very simple report I pulled together on those ENA Upstream counterparties you are trying to get masters in place with.  I ran a Sitara report to check those names against two GTC types that weren't already reported under my regular report:  Committed Reserves GTC and Wellhead Pooling Point GTC.  I'll email you my regular report and I can run something like that in the future once you decide on the threshold levels you'd like to see.

Judy,

For ENA, we have set thresholds of reporting any counterparty with 100 or more total transactions clearing on online GTCs, 100 or more deals on spot GTCs, and 30 or more deals on Firm GTCs.  While some of these obviously don't apply to ENA Upstream now (online deals), others do.  Do you want to keep the same thresholds or lower yours?  I can create a separate spreadsheet for Gerald to review if you want to have separate, and lower, deal counts.  Please let me know.  I'm getting ready to send out the August report (this is usually done the first week of the month following production).

Thanks,

I think that is a good idea. I have attached a list of the counterparties that reflect those suppliers that are our highest priority because of the number of transactions as well as other provisions that are negotiated each month. Please let me know if there is anything else that you may need from me.

Judy, we currently run a monthly report that we give to Legal showing all counterparties with excess GTCs (both telephonic and online).  We also include credit information and comments regarding the status of any masters we may already have in place with the CP (if applicable).  Since Legal uses this as a tool to see where we really need to focus our negotiating efforts, would you like the report changed to include the ENA Upstream GTCs?  We can then include Gerald Nemec (and any other Legal folks you'd like to add) on the distribution.

Please let me know what you think.  If you'd like the ENA Upstream GTCs included, I will need to work with our IT guy to have the report format changed.  I'll also be happy to send you the August report once I'm done (hopefully today) so that you can see what I'm talking about.

Thanks!

Gerald,

Here is a revised copy of the agreement.  I added some strong safety
language in Section 22 which I need you to look at.  Also, I don't see a
"Failure to Perform" provision - is this covered somewhere else?

Also want to discuss the Remedy in case of Default provisions.  I don't want
BCCKOP to be able to shut the facility down and hold us hostage for payment
of something.  I want them to be able to terminate the agreement, and then
orderly shutdown the facility and then leave.  Otherwise, we keep on
operating.  Let's discuss.  Also added words on Schedule F.

Mr. Nemec -

This email is a follow-up to my voice message to you last week regarding the above-referenced document.  I work with Bill Mathews in the Denver office and we are preparing a compression administration agreement between Bear Paw Energy and Independent Production.  We are working off of your agreement and I was wondering if you could email me (tricia.flanigan@enron.com) the above-referenced agreement.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at 720-946-3661.

Thank you,

Patricia Flanigan

Gerald,
With Judy's departure from our group I have been asked to act as the liaison between the Upstream Desk and Legal. I understand that this is an outstanding issue.

After discussing with Nelson, he would like to include a clause stipulating that the three days is not a result of force majeure.

Attached is the revised Torch Energy Exhibit including the column heading changes, the two pooling point changes, and the percentage splits between IFERC and GD. 

Note: If both IFERC and GD volumes were zero for a given point, I made the pricing split as 50/50.

Please review and provide any comments as soon as possible.

In addition to the previous email that I sent to the group, you all know that as the "sole survivors" of Friday night, I had to send you a separate email:

Mike: Thank you, thank you, and thank you? for your wisdom, encouragement, and especially for letting me out of having to "wax on - wax off."

Coralina (the "Closer") Rivera:  Call me, we must go dancing again.

Gerald:  It was fun to see the party animal side to you, I knew you had it in you despite your conservative office demeanor.

John:  It is your pool table now? "TH--WACK!"

Stephen:  We are forever in your debt for introducing the Gallant Knight to us.

Hi Pat,

Everything's fine thanks.  I moved into a new house the day of the flood.
I was very nervous, but survived without damage.  Gerald's been in China.
Gerald, are you back in town?  Give me a call.

How are you doing Pat?  What's the story with you and Mark buying a house

Dave and Gerald,

I just wanted to say hi and see how you were doing.  Did the flood give you
any problems?  I hope all is well.

Dear Gerald:  I pulled up a "generic" TPA from Sandi Braband's files and there are some discrepancies between the old form and recent ones we've received from Shane.  Please call me tomorrow when you have a minute, so perhaps we can sit at a conference table and I can point out the differences one by one.  Then we can arrive at a concensus on how current forms should appear.

Thanks,
Mary

Scott,

I talked to Gerald after our telecon as you requested ----- here's the summ=
ary:

I repeated to Gerald my reply when you asked my opinion regarding the best =
way to approach Clark.  To reiterate for clarity, I suggest that Scott tell=
 Clark we are not satisfied with BCCK's management of activities related to=
 field construction and construction management activities.  If you (Scott)=
 feel it is appropriate or necessary to offer details, the general reasons =
are: (1) Poor communication leading to schedule delays and/or cost increase=
s; (2)  A very casual (and consequently unacceptable) approach to improving=
 the overall project schedule as necessary to achieve a 15 December 2001 in=
-service date; and, (3) Unilateral decision-making by BCCK without the cons=
ent of all Crescendo partners having the same effect as (1) above.  As a re=
sult, Scott and Ken mutually agree and have directed Dave to take a lead ro=
le in completing all construction, testing, commissioning, start-up and rel=
ated activities.  It is important to stress to Clark, that, while Dave and =
his delegates have primary authority and responsibility for completing thes=
e activities, it will not be done at the exclusion of BCCK.  To the contrar=
y, Crescendo requests and expects BCCK's full and open participation. =20

Though the contract does not explicitly address this action, Gerald agreed =
that since Enron wears the vast majority of all types of risk in this proje=
ct, it is reasonable for us (Enron) to take action in order to protect our =
interests.  In addition, Ken Krisa agrees with the need and reasons for mak=
ing this move, establishing strong support (though not, perhaps, unanimous)=
 at the Crescendo LLC level.  Because the contract does not provide specifi=
cally for this action, our options -- in increasing order of severity with =
regard to impact upon BCCK and the potential for unpleasant reactions by sa=
me -- are:

Most Productive, Least Destructive to Project and Relationships:

1.  Take the direct approach to Clark as I described above.

Plan B:

2.  Submit a change order under the appropriate section of the Contract cha=
nging BCCK's scope of work and informing them of the change in management p=
hilosophy and leadership.

Desperation Tactic:

3.  Declare the agreement in default due to non-performance and take over a=
ll activities contemplated by the agreement.

(Gerald --- How did I do???)

Dave

Troy, can you call Jill Mearz with TIE and get the same contract information for Gerald. Please forward the information to Gerald as well. Jill (972) 455-2980

Gerald, we are bidding on gas for several IPP's with this company. They are wanting to get a copy of our contract ASAP to begin the initial review process. When Troy forwards you the contract information what would be the turn around for a hard copy and email I could send them.

Jean felt free to come over to my area (on 31 now) and make fun of me in front of my new Director and VP!  Then she proceeded to brag about her new Mercedes S500, it was pretty classic Mrha.

Gerald -

Well, I don't have a monitor or a working phone, but other than that everything is going well in my new group.

Do you have plans this Sunday afternoon/evening?  If not, are you interested in grabbing a few beers or something?  My wife is going out of town on business so I won't have anything to do?.

Gerald, 

I sent the following email to Jeff Hodge and Jason Williams on October 25th ad have heard nothing.  I reminded them this morning as we need to reply by mid next week.  Also, LDWP will be in our offices Monday afternoon.  Is this something that you can address faster than Jeff?  If so, just let him know and let me know how to proceed.  There was an article in the NGI publication this morning regarding this.

Thanks,

Kim

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

As we breifly, ECS is developing a product for gas driven (as opposed to electric driven) horse power.  Essentially, the value proposition involves "wrapping" an existing gas horspower station with a Compression Service Agreement and allowing the Pipeline to pay for the shaft horspower in commodities other than (or solely in) cash.  ECS provides shaft horsepower (meaning that we bring gas, as opposed to elecricity) to the compressor.  Because Shippers would continue to pay for its fuel per the existing tariff, the Pipeline would utilize shipper fuel to pay for shaft horsepower.  This structure represents an avenue for the Pipeline to hedge the value of the molecules it collects from Shippers or simply to levelize their fuel burn.  Timing and basis differences could, presumably, be included to increase the value to the Pipeline and potentially passed through to the Shippers.  

Attached is a deal example that I recently presented to Great Lakes Gas Transmission that solves a fuel levelization problem they have on their system....they overcollect in the Winter and undercollect in the Summer.  It may be of some use in reviewing to help ascertain answers to the following:

1)	Would a gas compression service deal be required to be filed by the FERC?  My sence is that the answer is no. This is simply an O&M service
	contract and lease agreement.
2)	If a Pipeline is on an annual gas tracker, what would be the tracker implication?  It should be flat, as technically, ECS has not changed the
	amount of fuel collected/utilized....we have only provided optionality as to hedgeing???


Please give me a call to discuss.

Thanks

Chris Meyer

Gerald,

We are still waiting on our letter from the producer that cause us to Force Majeure Duke.  I will get it to you as soon as I get a copy.

Also, we had to claim Force Majeure on Enron North America. I assume we need to prepare a letter for them too? I have the letter from the producer on that one.

Let me know.

Judy

Gerald,

There were two changes to be made to the legal description of the property =
contained on the first page of the agreement as well as in Exhibit B:

1) In the third line, it should read a distance of 49.28' not 49.26'.

2) In the fourth line, the degree symbol is left off the N 51?. =20

I will send you through interoffice mail a copy of the survey plat for the =
land.  Will you or Keith take care of forwarding a copy of the agreement to=
 the police jury for review?

Gerald:

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

Keith

allowed to qualify the Subject Property for that special appraisal in a sub=
sequent tax year and the Subject Property may then be appraised at its full=
 market value.  In addition, the transfer of the Subject Property or a subs=
equent change in the use of the property may result in the imposition of an=
 additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer of the change i=
n the use of the land. Buyer acknowledges that there shall be no proration =
for, and Buyer shall be responsible for, payment of any "roll back" taxes o=
r any other redetermination of property taxes assessed or relating to the y=

reunder.

d by binding, self-administered arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbi=
tration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and all such =
proceedings shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  A single arbi=
trator shall be selected under the expedited rules of the AAA.  Only damage=
s allowed pursuant to this Agreement may be awarded and the arbitrator shal=
l have no authority to award consequential, treble, exemplary or punitive d=
amages of any type under any circumstances regardless of whether such damag=
es may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall have the powe=
r to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such arbitrat=
ion shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties s=
hall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such =
equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under=
 this Agreement.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either P=
arty may join the other Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respec=
t to which the Party seeking such joinder is a defendant, if the other Part=
y is required to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless such defendant in acc=
ordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.   Judgment upon the award =
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having a jurisdictio=
n hereof.

8.=09=09Entirety and Severability.  This Agreement constitutes the entire a=
greement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Pro=
perty.  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations=
 (whether oral or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those =
herein expressed.  In case any one or more of the provisions contained in t=
his Agreement shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenfo=
rceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability sha=
ll not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement shall be const=
rued as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never been=
 herein contained.

9.=09=09Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED UNDER AND IN ACCO=
RDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND FEDERAL LAW AS SET FORTH=

the Parties hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.

11.=09Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counte=
rparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and need not be sig=
ned by more than one of the Parties and all of which shall constitute one a=
nd the same agreement.

=0912.=09Further Assurances.  Each Party agrees that it will promptly perfo=
rm all other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be nec=
essary or appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreemen=
t.

=0913.=09Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the commencement of an arbitrati=
on proceeding or a breach of any of the provisions contained herein by eith=
er Party, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to collect from the other =

ing signed by both Parties which expressly refers to this Agreement and sta=
tes an intention to modify or amend it.  No such amendment or modification =

other form of either Party and in the event of conflict between the terms o=
f this Agreement and any such form, the terms of this Agreement shall contr=
ol.

=0915.=09Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms =
of this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any su=
bsequent breach of the terms of this Agreement.  The failure of any Party t=
o insist upon strict performance of any provisions of this Agreement or to =
exercise any right under it shall not constitute a waiver of that provision=
.

=0916.=09Termination.  This Agreement shall expire and shall be of no furth=
er force or effect Ninety (90) days from the Effective Date unless prior to=
 such time the Parties have entered into an act of Cash Sale transferring t=

Chris - we would very much like to get the Amended and Restated Compression Services Agreement executed, as these changes were agreed to several months ago and the project is moving forward.  Could you let me know when we can expect to get this agreement returned? Thanks.

Bridgeline was checking the issues on their side concerning payment directly to Dow.  We made it clear that we prefer they directly pay Dow.  They were supposed to get back with Brian later today.  Sorry I didn't make that clear earlier.

We need to figure out how to play this out ASAP so that we know how much cash needs to be sent out.  My guess is that we would prefer to have Bridgeline pay Dow directly.  I have a voicemail from the guy at Dow and would like to get back with him on our plan.  Let me know.  Thanks.

Brian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.  They are concerned about netting issues.

Subject:	Dow Invoice

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Also, if you have any paper work on the "promotional funds" contract it would be good to see.  I can't remember if it is a one time payment or yearly or a lump sum over a term.  I want to make sure that obligation goes with AEP and its one of those "deals" that could have fallen in the cracks.

Cyndie,

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,
SBR

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be "Payment by wire on the 25th Day". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

Gerald, this is just to follow up on the voicemail message I left for you
this afternoon.  Can you please provide me with contact information for reps
from both Louisiana Resources and Bridgeline.  The transfer of control
applications to be filed with the FCC require signatures from reps from both
parties to the transaction.  We will need this info before we can file the
applications.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Eric,  The answers to your questions based on the information I have are:

     1.  The transaction closed on February 3, 2000.
     2.  All the licenses that you fowarded for Louisiana Resources are
currently being used by Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.
     3.  I don't know.  I don't think that any of the licenses were new
after the transaction date.  Robert, any different info?
     4.  To the best of my knowledge all of the licenses (that you
forwarded) are operating and were operating at the time of the transaction.
Do you agree, Robert?

To clarify, the assets were not sold to Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  They
were contributed to the formation of the LP in consideration for Enron's
40% equity stake and 50% control.  No transfer applications for these
licenses has been filed.

Also, it is not clear from the information you forwarded whether the
licenses were in Louisiana Resources Company's (LRC) name or Louisiana
Resources Pipeline Company Limited Partnership (LRP).  LRP was merged into
Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.  LRC is still held 100% by Enron North America
Corp.

   Gerald, this is just to follow up on our prior phone conversations re:
   the
   sale of Louisiana Resources' assets (including licenses) to Bridgeline .
   As
   I mentioned, what is important to our inquiry is whether transfer of
   applications were filed prior to the consummation of the above
   transaction
   whereby the assets of Louisiana Resources' were acquired.  I will need
   the
   following transaction information:

   *  When did the transaction close?  The exact date. 2/?/2000
   *  Which licenses where part of that transaction?
   *  Which licenses were obtained by filing a new application after the
   transaction date?
   *  Which stations are constructed/operating?

   As a reminder, we are under a deadline to get this information to the
   FCC.
   To make the deadline I will need the information by tomorrow or Monday
   at
   the latest.  Please call/email with any questions.

   Thanks and have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Hi Gerald,

I hope that things have gone well with your first set
of law clerks.  I was writing to confirm that I will
be starting work for you next Monday, July 2.  I have
been trying to contact the HR representative that I
spoke with initially, but she hasn't returned my
calls.  I just wanted to make sure that everything was
set for me to begin working.

I also wanted to let you know that I heard from the
HBA about the photograph you recommended me for.  I
wanted to thank you for remembering me.  I think that
will be a great opportunity for me.

If you need to contact me, my phone number is
713-523-4723
or my mobile is 281-814-9934.

Sincerely,

Alisha Mahabir

In a phone call this morning, the Palo Alto City Attorney's office had several comments and suggested revisions to the NGSA.  I have attempted to capture these few comments in the attached draft, which I am forwarding to you despite the fact that only a few pages are implicated (pages 4, 9, 10, 11, and 12, I believe).  We can discuss these changes when you are able to return my phone call. 
Also, can you confirm that PG&E's electronic bulletin board "Inside Tracc" is available to anyone with the appropriate software, and that no confidentiality agreements are needed to gain access?  This is what one of the utility folks at Palo Alto tells me. 
Talk to you soon.

We are currently not including any evergreen clauses in any of the Upstream contracts with the exception of GISB's and Masters.

Gerald,

One more question:  I assume the new keep whole GTCs are primary term.  There is no mention in either the Confirm or the GTC language.  Can you please confirm?   Again, I need something to default to in the template I am setting up.

Thanks,

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Yes, I'll get those out to you today.  Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help.  I'll let Elizabeth Hernandez and Kevin Brady know - they've been calling almost every day asking the status.

Stacy,  Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.  I will do so.  Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.  Thanks.

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

 << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Georganne, this agreement will be executed Monday, dated as of Fri, Sept 28. I am out of the office on Monday, but by this e-mail I am asking Gerald Nemec to forward to you a copy of the executed agreement.  Will you please oversee the removal of the transportation positions from the MTM books as of Sept 30 (you mentioned Jeff Gosset?). The 3Q removal is important as Northern Border will be recognizing income as a result of the agreement.  We have already discussed (casually at last Monday's mtg) our accounting. We will probably need to discuss the Purchase Price Adjustment due ENA, as it has been negotiated and is being netted against the amounts due to Northern for the transportation capacity (we are the net payor). Generally speaking, AA may notice, if so, let me know, although clearly the acctg risks in this deal belong to Northern.

Steve, Yes, I did receive a response from Robert Rose about the Napoleonville conveyance.  Ann Elizabeth has said she gave the file to you, so we're still in a position to do a complete search.  -Mary

Hi Mary, 
I don't have a clue who filed the original documents.  I know for a 
fact that ROW did not do the filing for this transaction.  It seems 
to me it would have been someone on EB38 who did the filing. 
Back a couple of months ago there were copies of some of the 
agreements in a meeting AE, Patrick Johnson, and I had (I 
think AE brought her copies to the meeting).  So, it would 
stand to reason that these copies should exist in AE's 
"Enron" files left on EB38.  I don't think I ever saw the 
originals though.

Dear Robert:  Do you recall what you did with the documents relating to
Bridgeline whereby the Napoleonville land was kept out of the
transaction by being deeded over to LRCI, Inc.?  Patrick Johnson recalls
you were involved with those documents, and we're trying to find them.
Ann Elizabeth White said that she believes the files are here in Legal,
but we can't locate them.  Patrick Johnson's recollection that you might
have filed the conveyance documents is what leads me to ask you if you
have them or know where they are.  
Thanks for letting me pick your brain on (yet again) another document
search.
Best wishes,

Wayne,

Attached are the redline contracts including the modification to the GTC article 2. Per our earlier conversation, I have inserted "Seller's Daily Deliverablity" as the amount that must be scheduled or the contract is in default. Please let myself or John Grass know if you have any further concerns.

Gerald,

Attached is a copy of the draft Reciprocal Keep Whole language for the MMS deal. 

Also, one other Global change to the Reciprocal Keep Whole language that I have not made is that the publication for Gas Daily apparently has changed from Financial Times to Platts? I was not sure what the exact name we are supposed to use for the publication.

Attached is my draft of the "two-pager" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart

Gerald,

Here are the documents on the Questar open seasons that Stephanie discussed with you.  Since the precedent agreements are binding, we would like to put in some sort of contingency clause to give Enron a potential out.  Unfortunately, we only have the PAs in pdf format, so we may need to just write in whatever language we need.

The Denver office will be meeting with Questar on Tuesday or Wednesday to discuss the open season details, and we can touch base after then.  

Have a good holiday weekend.

Phil

Recent message from China Jonny:


Howdy! We haven't moved yet to Nanjing, I was just there for work purposes.
Will be moving there in late August (probably August 23-25). It's been
rainy/cloudy here in SE China for the last three days, a wonderful respite
from the furnace like heat of the past six weeks. The countryside from
Shanxi all the way down to Jiangsu province was choked with varying shades
of green. Even Shanxi province has received some rain this summer; this
helps mitigate the effects of a three-year drought they've suffered through
recently.

Had a good 4-day weekend in Taiyuan. We had a big dinner party for Ai Ping's

father on his 65th birthday. This party also served as mini-wedding
reception for us and the Shang family's close friends. Both of Ai Ping's
parents are from Henan province. One of Ai Ping's uncles works for her
brother in the steel business. Essentially, he's a good-hearted,
hardworking, farmer from the Shang family's ancestral home village. Northern

Chinese peasants are world famous for their ability to drink gallons of rice

liquor, and I was witness to a fascinating display of this sort. The uncle
must have consumed about a liter of various alcohols including the local
moonshine, a bottle of Jim Beam that I brought, and lots of Qingdao beer.

He was the king of China for an hour; people were rolling on the floor with
his antics. The wait staff of the restaurant even stopped working to observe

him bouncing off the walls in drunken glee. He drank two large whiskey and
cokes within minutes and stated,"It's just like drinking a cool glass of
water!" to the delight of the revelers. Of course, disaster eventually
struck. He hadn't eaten enough food, and his poor liver couldn't process the

tidal wave of booze. First, his head went bonk onto the table. People ran
for cover expecting the worst. He wretched under the table. Ai Ping's
parents were obviously embarresed, but didn't lose too much face because
everyone was friends or family.

We're hoping to make a trip back to the USA in early October if all goes as
planned. Is this a good time for your guys? China has its National Day
holiday (one week) in the first week of October. We would leave China around

the 29-30th of September and make it a one week trip back to the states. The

Wuxi school is obligated to reimburse me for two, round-trip plane tix. I
need to use them before I lose them. This summer's work schedule didn't
allow me any time off. Let me know if this is a good week for you guys.

Dad, we'll need your assistance in obtaining a tourist visa for Ai Ping. You

and Mom will need to write a "letter of invitation" for Ai Ping explaining
the reason for her travels to the US (ie. an Iowan wedding reception). The
person who invites the Chinese national to the US must also do one of two
things according to the US Embassy's website in Beijing: either provide tax
information from the last 2-3 years OR fill out and sign the I-134 form
which guarantees your economic situation. Unfortunately, you're going to be
involved in some more beaurocratic bliss in order for us to get Ai Ping her
travel visa. My sincere apologies. We've begun collecting documents here on
the China side for the same purpose. I'll do some more net research
concerning this issue, and try to provide you with more info. However,
please start preparing these documents if possible. Once Ai Ping is issued a

tourist visa to the states, travels there, and returns she'll have a much
easier time obtaining the next visa in the future because she'll prove to
the INS that she's not an immigration threat. Thank you for your assistance
in these matters.

That's all for now. Will write again in near future with more info. Hope all

clan members are healthy and in good spirits...

Love,

Jon

Whatup Dog?  How is Enron treating you?  Still enjoying the legal side of
things?

Everything here is going well.  Marriage is still very good, even blissful.
Michigan has been great so far but I am still waiting for the weather to
turn.  I am not jazzed about the winters here.

I have been keeping of with the horns (of course) a little from up here.
The UNC game was televised here and I think UofH is on ESPN2, I just don't
know whether it is regional or not.  I agree with you on the analysis.  We
are strong on defense and special teams (surprisingly so on special teams),
but I still worry about our DTs.  Offense is stagnant and I continue to wait
for them to get on the same page.  We have soooooo much potential there.

I haven't been to a Michigan game yet.  We missed Miami Ohio and I don't
think Lyd and I are going to got to the Eastern Michigan game this weekend.
We will certainly be going to the Big 10 games though.

Let me know how things are going when you have a chance.  Ironically, I am
busier now then I think I ever was at Enron.  I feel like I am constantly
behind the curve.

Talk to you soon.

Rude-Dog

Rude Dog,  How is it going?  Enjoying every moment of marital bliss!!
Must be weird to be a student again and have to do all that studying and
drink all that beer.

The Horns are looking pretty good.  The defense has really been
spectacular as well as special teams.  The offense is sputtering right
now, but I think they will get back on track.  I am going to the UH game
this weekend.  We had better put a whipping on them. But with Texas you
never know.  Gone to any Michigan games yet?

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the "MBTI Work Styles"-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

As you are aware a "safety net" type of provision has been included in the master netting agreement to attempt to convert any underlying master agreement one way payment provision to a two way payment provision.  However, this is only a safety net and should not be relied upon.  It may not cover every particular definitional/form structure in an underlying master agreement.  Please be sure to review the underlying master.  It is probably always best to draft a contract specific amendment to convert to 2way payment since this is a critical issue to effect properly the closeout netting and setoff provisions of the master netting agreement.  The specific amendment can be included in the master netting or accomplished as a separate amendment to the underlying master agreement.

Any questions, call me.

Hey guys,
I have brought the digital camera today.  I will be leaving around 12:30 to make an optical appointment, so if we can get together for about 3-5 minutes at your convenience, I can have your pictures on the internet by Monday.  Let me know what is good for you....

Gerald:  I have already completed #1. On #2, they just want some
assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or
other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or
under the Property would suffice.  As far as #3, my abstractor has
promised to complete this limited title search today.  I hope to hear
from him tommorrow.

Gentlemen:

Please find the attached letter agreement, structure term sheet and key assumptions for the Kathleen Anne storage field.  I would suggest the following:

1.	All parties review and comment on the language of the documents.  

2.	All parties should assess the assumptions provided with respecto to their requirements and economics.

3.	Enron will forward the historical values for the summer/winter spreads.  Note: the average value (2006 $s) of the expected summer/winter spreads going forward is assumed to be $0.38.  This spread is based on Enron's price curves, and the base economic value of the deal assumes we capture the full summer/winter spread in each year.  

4.	All parties develop assumptions/requirements for the following:
	a)	GLO and PNP required % of net oil revenue (net of costs) during EOR period, and storage period
	b)	GLO and PNP required % of net storage revenue
	c)	Enron base marketing fee (as well as cost estimate)
	d)	Enron at risk marketing payment


5.	 We meet to discuss:
	a)	Transaction structure, roles and responsibilities
	b)	Key project assumptions
	c)	Actions going forward

Regards,
Brian

At 4pm on Wednesday Liza arrived with the DASH.  It had not been circulated prior to that and there was no-one available to discuss the deal as Eva was not in the office.  Please  have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the DASH in advance of when you want it signing.

4pm on Wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn't give enough time to complete a DASH.

Louise

Subject:	Sale of Napoleonville Land

Louise,

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM.
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "Act of Sale" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental).

I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding "war" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

Mr. Nemec,

My name is Sherry Taylor, I am working with one of the largest national law
firms in recruiting an experienced energy associate. This opportunity is
based in the Houston office.  The focus of this opportunity is regulatory
matters, both upstream (FERC and transportation-related matters) and
downstream issues (production-side regulatory matters including exploration
issues and joint operating agreement issues).    I would like to give you
more specifics, I am unsure of the best way to contact you.   If you would
be open to discuss, just let me know the best time and contact number.
Sherry Taylor (817) 578-8633 or sherrytaylor7@earthlink.net.
Thanks,
Sherry

Gerald, 
Thanks for the feedback.  Attached is the latest version of the Term Sheet (changes are in BLUE) for your review.  

Chris and Ned are meeting with Unocal early this afternoon.

Thanks, Lisa

Subject:	RE: Unocal Term Sheet

I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.  

I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then "Capacity Release" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further.

Gerald, 
Per our conversation yesterday, attached is the Unocal Term Sheet for your review and comment.  This is a non-binding proposal.  Note that the items in red are either questionable items or rates/prices that need to be confirmed and/or filled in.  
 << File: Unocal Keystone Term Sheet (Sep-06).doc >>  

The compression guys are meeting with Unocal tomorrow (Friday) early afternoon to discuss the project and term sheet.

Please advise.

I can confirm that we do have positions with DHRI and Dow Chemical that may be in-the-money to Enron.  We need to mindful of any action with regard to LRCI that could trigger a setoff.

Keegan:

Yes, order Gerald a new computer.  Most of our lawyers have the Compaq Armada M700.  The keyboard is a little larger than the M300.  In the meantime until the new computer is received, please get with Holly Keiser and see if Gerald can use one of the loaner laptops.

Good afternoon Janette!

Gerald's computer has crashed for the third time.  He has an older model IBM thinkpad, which he uses as his main hard drive.  We are constantly calling hardware out to do repairs, but the solutions have only been temporary.  May I have permission to order a new laptop for him?  Currently, he is without a computer, and has been waiting on hardware to bring him a loaner.  Please advise as to how I can resolve this issue.  I appreciate your advice.  Thanks,

Keegan

Gerald,

The contact information for Assumption Parish is as follows:

Assumption Parish Police Jury
Attn: Kim Torres
P.O. Box 524
Napoleonville, LA 70390

I have two changes that you may have already taken note of.  The first change is in the description of the property on the first page.  In the 8th line in the description, it says "the South property line a distance or 260.02..."  it should read "distance of 260.02".  This change also needs to be made in the description contained within Exhibit B.  In the description contained within Exhibit B, there should not be a period after the words "to the point of beginning" in the 10th line.  

The second change is also in Exhibit B on page 2.   In the paragraph that starts "all parties signing the written instrument....", I don't think "marital status" should be in there.   

One final thing, the purchase price for the warehouse and land is $100,000.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.  Also, let me know if you need any help with the lawn-mowing agreement.   

Thanks for your help.  

Rakhi

Attached are my comments.  Obviously, I haven't reviewed the original lease so I am providing comments from a less than optimal vantage point.

There exists another receivable financing covering power receivables structured at the corporate level.  I am working with Trey Cash and Melinda Winn to extract the receivables to enable the master netting agreements to be executed.  For now, please touch base with me prior to initialing any master netting that includes power.  Please note we are still working on the extraction from the gas receivables as well.

Dad and they wanted me to let ya'll know that they are not sure if they will
be flying back from Vegas tomorrow or not.  It all depends on what happens

Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who cleans
your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we didn't
show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun? Do you
have a football game to go to this weekend? Talk to you soon.

Gerald,

I just received a copy of the revised LIG invoice from Bob Walker.  They are now billing Bridgeline for the amount owed.  I am concerned that Bob states in the letter that I provided Bridgeline's costs on their behalf.  

Any thoughts as to what this might open up?
Thanks,
Karen

Geetings Kevin:

Wanted to touch base to make sure that CNRL signs agency papers, preferably before we do the release on PGT's electronic board. Gerald Nemec is our attorney and he has put together language surrounding our responsibilities for other agency deals. As I understand, we will mangage all aspects of the transporation agreement which includes review of invoices and the ability to net transportation charges from the supply payment. 

Please advise if you need assistance from either Gerald or me in this regard.

Thanks,

Stephanie

Two minor editorial changes in bold italics. In the first I removed a superfluous "s". The second is an added word.

Sorry for the delay. I'm on the west coast for the week. Daphne knows how to reach me.

Subject:	NNG Hubbard

Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

One other thing I forgot to add:  we've already discussed having templates for those CPs with changed due dates, but we are waiting to see just how many CPs request these change.  Right now it's manageable and I don't want to have a bunch more templates to have to worry about.  It's easy enough to remember to change those new GTCs we set up now, so we'll just play it by ear.  If too many CPs request these changes that it makes it difficult for us to keep track of, then we'll set up new templates accordingly.

Please give me a shout if you have any questions.

Thanks!
SBR

Cyndie,

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,
SBR

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be "Payment by wire on the 25th Day". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!
Cyndie

Lloyd,

Which contracts are you talking about?  The Asset Management Agreement between ENA and AGI Highstar or the 2 Operation and Maintenance Agreements between G.L.C.Consulting Service Incorporated and each of Lumberton Power, L.L.C. and Elizabethon Power, L.L.C.   Or were you referring to something else?

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

Mark Haedicke

Hello all. Kimberly was too efficient and sent this out before I had a chance to call you.  We have a new Associate who recently joined our group. He is new to Enron and will be helping with our "Producer Focus" efforts. Since we sell a number of products (including some of yours), I  would like to request 30 minutes to an hour for you (or someone else in your group) to spend with Shauywn telling him about your business and how your group works with us. Kimberly will be getting with you to set up a time if you are available. Thank you for your assistance and time. I appreciate it.

Amigos, I can't say anything about what we are doing out here.  I will tell
you this...the President told the military to be ready.  We are.

I appreciate the kind thoughts and words.  We're keeping the faith out here.
Take care.  Paul.

	FYI,


	Here is a copy of the Draft agreement with the addition of text in red
	that Barbara wanted to incorporate as part of our "template".  Oakhill
	will not get the red in this draft.  The text in blue is what I added or 
	changed with Barbara's input.  

	We've incorporated a few new concepts:
		- we have a "date certain" for our deal to start
		- I've provided for operation before our "Start Date" (because
		  we've mitigated construction risk by pushing the Start Date
		  back).  This is termed the "Pre-Start Date Period" which can
		  begin after we have completed the "Facility Testing" and deemed
		  the facility suitable and ready for commercial operation.  
		- I've reduced the most of the response and notifications timing
		  from the customer to ECS.

Gerald,

Would it be possible to get a draft of the agreement for the sale of the 2.82 acres to Bridgeline in the next day or two?  This is something that we would like to finalize in the next week, if possible.

Let me know.

Gerald,

This will confirm our telephone conversation of today's date.  As I
explained by phone, we are trying to obtain consistency of our Gas Supply
Agreements between the various operating subsidiaries of Xcel Energy Inc.,
including Cheyenne Light Fuel & Power and Public Service Company of
Colorado.  Currently, a GISB Style Agreement is in place between Enron
companies and each of the Northern States Power companies (MN and WI).
Enron has also executed a Spot Gas Purchase Agreement with Southwestern
Public Service Company, another operating subsidiary.  Each of these
agreements contain more detailed provisions to describe the agreement of the
parties than the Enfolio Firm General Terms and Conditions furnished for our
review.

In particular, our concerns with the Enfolio General Terms and Conditions
("GTC") include, but are not limited to, the following:

1.  Unlike the GISB style Agreement, the GTC contains no provisions to deal
with the possibility that a price will not be published for a particular
geographic location on any given day, except with respect to Default
situations under paragraph 2.  The GISB Agreement addresses that possibility
by incorporating the idea of using an average of previous day-next
succeeding day publication pricing in the event no published price is
available for the relevant gas day.

2.  The GTC includes netting of payments due from one party to another.
That is problematic for us from a regulatory perspective, as payment streams
for purchases made by the utility are passed through without markup to our
ratepayers, while accounting methods for any sales of gas by the utility
receive different treatment.  Neither the NSP GISBs nor the SPS Spot Gas
Purchase Agreement referred to above contain such netting provisions.

3.  The Force Majeure provisions under the GTC are not nearly as detailed as
those in our existing NSP and SPS agreements.

4.  The GTC has no written provisions for audit rights.  It appear to me
that the only contractual methodology for obtaining this information would
be through discovery in arbitration proceedings.  In contrast, our
agreements with Enron for the other operating utilities have written audit
provisions included therein.

5.  There are certain other provisions which we need to include in our
agreement (i.e. firm transactions, as opposed to interruptible delivery,
compliance with affirmative action statutes and regulatory provisions,
disclosure to regulatory bodies of contractual provisions, with request for
protective order regarding pricing, etc.). With the exception of firmness of
the transactions, the GTC does not seem as amenable to modification through
the inclusion of Special Provisions or amendments, as does the GISB to
address these concerns.

We understand that GISB, as originally crafted, does not deal with
transactions of longer than one month, however we believe the inclusion of
Special Provisions to negate that language, together with the inclusion of
"Early Termination" type provisions to address Enron's concerns upon the
occurrence of a "Triggering Event" would meet Enron's needs.  Alternatively,
we are willing to consider any alternative language that you may propose,
keeping in mind our desire to move toward more consistency of the agreements
between our various operating companies.

Please let me have your thoughts.  We would like to get signed agreements in
place prior to commencement of the Delivery Period.  As always, I look
forward to working with you to achieve that result.

Sincerely,

Alan Bransgrove

Jim,

I have sent a copy of the T4 permit revision that was sent to the RRCT in May of this year for the HPL Compression Company facility--Permit #05561.  As I noted on the cover letter, AEP must submit a new P5 which identifies their organizational information in order for Kathy Arnold to process the T4 permit for this facility.

I also a voicemail with you.  Can you or someone in your group file a notice on these permits?  HPL Compression was dissolved with the sale of HPL.

Jim, I am not sure who handled the operating permits.  I think that type of stuff was usually handled by someone in the gas pipeline group.

Jim,

Do you know who is responsible for cancelling the operating permits for HPL Compression?  Zero Gross Receipt Tax reports will have to be filed quarterly until that permit is canceled.

I hope reading this material doesn't destroy your weekend.

Gerald,

As a follow up to your discussion on Friday with Jill Zivley regarding the Aspect/Helmrich & Payne, et al dedicated lease contract #96055540, Jill asked me to coordinate with you to get the amendment to this contract prepared. Per my discussion with Jill, the following items need to be addressed in the amendment.

Add the new well
Change the working interest
Include a statement to address our timing for changing working interest to the month succeeding the month that we are notified
Extend the contract an additional year from the end of the contract term

I will bring you copies of the contract (including the assignment from Enron North America to ENA Upstream) as well as the working interest sheet as soon as I have them. Jill would like to have this contract completed this week since the well is expected to begin flowing any day.

If you have any questions or need anything else on this request, please let me know.

Thanks,
Judy

Dear Shane:  Once you give me the fully-executed TPA, I make a file copy for our office and send the original to the Global Contracts group, along with a distribution worksheet that I fill out.  My contact at the Global Contracts group is Linda Bryan in EB 2128a.  I understand that EES contracts are handled by Colette Weinreich at ext. 57516.  

Best wishes,
Mary

Stacy,

I have three questions about the attached letter. 

1. Are we doing this transaction as ENA or ENA Upstream? 
2. Are the confirms in the name of ENA? The August - October deals were done between ENA Upstream and Linder.
3. Are the confirmations under GTC Spot? I thought they were going to be GTC FIRM.

If you could get back to me regarding these questions, I would appreciate it.

Judy

Jean/Cris,
As a follow-up to our meeting last week, I reviewed the Gallup closing documents and I spoke to Gerald Nemec today regarding whether Enron Corp. issued a financial guarantee to ECHO (funded by Natwest/Equity Investor, Patty Melcher) to compensate for the risk from closing to the start of operations.  Gerald Nemec and Mark Knippa both confirmed that Enron did not issue a financial guarantee, even though the project closed prior to the start of operations.  At the time of closing, construction was about 2/3 complete and the legal documents were in place stating a definitive start date.  The definitive start date ensured that funds would flow regardless of whether the facility was operational.  Essentially, TW was on the hook for the annual payment, etc. beginning on the start date outlined in the legal agreement.  The investors were comfortable with the project's progress at the time of closing and they basically were willing to take TW/Enron credit risk without a financial guarantee. 
  
Let me know if you have any other inquiries.

Thanks, Lisa

Gerald, is the capacity release for Columbia Pipeline the only transport or storage product offered on EOL that you know of?   Is Enron always the owner of the capacity to be released and acquired via EOL?  bng

See the new versions of the netting agreement forms below.  All that has been done is to move the Force Majeure concept to paragraph 2(a) from 14(b).  This allows the daily limit concept to stand in the UMAs, but it won't elevate to a default under the master netting arrangements.  In certain instances if you want to "kill" the day limitation completely in the underlying agreement, you can always use the previous 14(b) language from the emailed docs earlier today.    The docs remain at v1 (version 1).

Chris,
The CA looks okay.  I made one change in para 4 that requires Enron to identify and mark the confidential information sent to Ormat.  I presume that not ALL correspondence between us will have to do with structured horsepower transactions.

See attached.

This is just too delicious to not share...

STRAWBERRIES ROMANOFF 


1 1/2 pounds firm ripe strawberries, washed, dried, stemmed & quartered
lengthwise (reserve 6 berries with stems for garnish) 
1/4 cup Grand Marnier (can use Triple Sec or Cointreau) 
1/4 cup sugar 
Chantilly Romanoff
3 tbs chopped pistachio nuts (garnish) 

Combine berries and liqueur in large bowl and sprinkle with sugar.
Mix gently with spoon. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4
hours, spooning syrup over berries once or twice. One hour before
serving, divide berries and syrup among 6 sherbert or balloon wine
glasses. Refrigerate. Just before serving, spoon Chantilly Romanoff
over berries and garnish with reserved strawberries. Sprinkle each
serving with pistachio nuts.


CHANTILLY ROMANOFF

1 cup heavy whipping cream, well chilled 
2 tbs Grand Marnier 
1/2 tsp vanilla 
1/2 cup sour cream, chilled 

Beat cream in large mixing bowl until slightly thickened. Add
liqueur and vanilla and continue beating until soft peaks form.
Fold in sour cream, then beat until mixture is thick and holds its
shape. Refrigerate until ready to use.

Chris,

This will confirm our discussions of today regarding accelerating completion
of electric power to the pumping station.

It is Enron Compression Services' (ECS') desire to accelerate the completion
of the project from the currently projected early May, 2002 completion date
to March 1, 2002.  ECS will agree to pay the acceleration cost.  Our current
"most probable estimate" of this cost is $630,000, but it could run as much
as $1,060,000 or higher.  ECS would like a guaranteed cap of $1,000,000.
Gulf estimates that the acceleration activities discussed with you will
provide a confidence level of greater than 90% that we can meet the March 1,
2002 date.  Both of us agree that we cannot give any guaranteed date because
of the inherent uncertainties.  Our budget for the line construction
contractor cost is $864,000, including accounting and other standard
overheads.  ECS would pay any amount over that.  Additionally. ECS would pay
$70,000 for accelerating the structure design and Hinsons Crossroads
Substation activities.  ECS would also pay approximately $130,000 to
accelerate acquisition of Right of Way.  We have faxed letters between Gulf
and attorneys for three property owners which shows the difference between
the parties.  ECS would like some assurances that cost is reasonably
minimized within the constraints of meeting the desired schedule.

The details and specifics of the above would be formalized in an agreement
to be signed between the parties.  Both parties acknowledge that time is of
the essence in completing the execution of a suitable agreement, lest the
start of acceleration of the project be delayed to the point that we would
not be able to meet the March 1, 2002 date.  

We also discussed the merits of developing a Memorandum of Intent for the
parties to quickly execute so that some of the acceleration activities can
begin as the agreement is finalized.  This agreement must be completed
within the next few days.

ECS also raised the prospect of two agreements, one to cover the Right of
Way, and another to address the line construction.

We will be faxing to you tomorrow a Gantt chart of a proposed acceleration
schedule.

Regarding the cost breakdown of the line construction cost, the following is
a typical cost by activities:

	Structure Framing and Setting			45%
	Anchors and Guys				10%
	Conductors and Static Wires 			30%
	Grounding					 5%
	Miscellaneous					10%

	TOTAL						100%


This should complete the information you requested.  Please call me if you
need more at this time.  We will provide you a draft of the Memorandum as
soon as possible.

We are going to do a month to month interupptible purchase agreement with Patina Oil and Gas.  The gas will be delivered into Lost Creek.  The price will be Gas Daily Cig Midpoint index flat.  The flows will vary daily depending upon well production.  I am not sure if we have an interruptible purchase agreement with Kennedyl

Did Paul ask you to put together a wellhead purchase for Huber in the Powder River Basin?

Lloyd,

Which contracts are you talking about?  The Asset Management Agreement between ENA and AGI Highstar or the 2 Operation and Maintenance Agreements between G.L.C.Consulting Service Incorporated and each of Lumberton Power, L.L.C. and Elizabethon Power, L.L.C.   Or were you referring to something else?

Gerald:  I have already completed #1. On #2, they just want some
assurance that the property has never had underground storage tanks or
other hazardous waste sources on it.  I believe a letter from LRCI
stating that to its knowledge there have been no such sources on or
under the Property would suffice.  As far as #3, my abstractor has
promised to complete this limited title search today.  I hope to hear
from him tommorrow.

Please review & edit as necessary. If possible, once "buffed to a shine", I'd like to be able to insert this language into the GTC Confirm template above Notice information. This particular scenario is for Unimark LLC (deal #1146397).

Language Take 1:

Payment Terms:  As hereto agreed, payment by Buyer to Seller for gas received by Buyer during the preceding calendar month shall be made payable by wire transfer on the 25th Day of the Month following delivery. If the due date for any payment to be made under this Agreement is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be the following Business Day.


Please let me know as soon as possible as this is a Nov Production deal that has not yet been confirm & also due to the prior conversations Settlements, Judy, Lisa & Contracts has had with the CP.

Thank you!!!

Mary,

Would you call AEW and find out where we can find a copy of the Tract 5B sale from Enron Storage Company to LRCI, Inc. here in our office--I know you are planning to call Sandi Braband; according to the message below, AEW must have done the work.

Also, would you please call Keith Daigle (I don't want to use Locke Lidell on this) and ask him to obtain a file stamped copy of "all" ESC conveyances to LRCI that are filed in the Assumption Parish Records.  Keith's phone number is 504-830-3990 or 985-898-1909.

Would you also ask Keith how he is coming on the Sorrento Right of Way Agreement that I sent him on July 7.  We need to have that back by the time Patrick Johnson returns next Monday.  Please give him a "gentle" prod. 

Thanks,

Steve

Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows:

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine:
Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 

Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A:
Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds?

Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

In celebration of my birthday this weekend my brother and a good friend of
mine are coming to Houston Thursday night through Sunday.  We are going
straight to PF Chang's on Westheimer from the airport, and should be there
no later than 7-7:30. After dinner we will head over to Taco Milagro or
similar for the rest of the night. This is an open invitation to anyone who
would like to meet us at either place.  My cell is 678.592.8550 if you want
to get an update. Hope to see you there, and please feel free to pass this
on.

Hey Gerald, I was talking with Kenny Smith about LRC, and the people associated with HPL that went over with AEP, when I thought of a certain facility planner. I looked at the Enron directory, and found that you were still with Enron. I presume you're still with ENA. Are you still working contracts with them? I had a chance to speak with Kevin Kuehler a few months ago, and according to him AEP is busy relooking at all kind of possibilities (old estimates). I don't know how long that kind of enthusiasm will last. AEP will probably find out (what ENA already knew) how hard it is to make some good margins.

Let me know how things are with you these days.

Here is the GTC deal clearing report for September 2001.  I've included counterparties with greater than 100 online deals, 100 spot deals, or 30 firm deals clearing on GTCs.  I've also included a few counterparties under those thresholds because of the poor credit rating (those counterparties are highlighted).

Please let me know if you have any questions or need to change these reporting thresholds.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

The fact that these contracts are in the name of ENA really changes things.  Could you conduct a review (or delegate this responsibility to someone working on the bankruptcy stuff) of the relevant contracts for this transaction to determine what impact the bankruptcy of ENA has had?  Thanks

Stuart

Subject:	Hubbard Transaction


	I've completed a review of the ENA Hubbard transaction that provides Compression Services to NNG.  
	Note that this is contracted as ENA and not ECS.  Gerald communicated that the previous agreement
	with Hubbard was executed as an ENA contract or assigned from ECT to ENA.  

	My short term objective is to gather and submit the required information to the Corp. Cash Management
	committee and get the delinquent power bills paid and brought up to date.  Currently we have Oct. and
	Nov. bills form Midland Power Cooperative & I've confirmed that ENA/ECS has received payments for
	Oct. from NNG that account for $64,508 (Annual Charge) and $37,493 (electrical on-peak billing I assume)
	for a total of $102,001.99.  

	I gathered up the cash flow projections for the project and provided a summary version to Stuart.  Oct. business
	projected a monthly load equivalent to an $81,000 electric bill versus the $90,148 actual.  He wants us to pull
	actual billing for the months beginning with this contract term (July 1, 2000) through November 2001 and 
	represent actual income to date and projection income from that point.  

	I'll expect that we will need the same process for the TW transactions at Gallup, Bisti and Bloomfield to 
	get these bills paid despite the LLC structure that houses the accrual business.  I was under the 
	impression that this information, billing and reimbursements was being tracked by first Carol Carter and
	then her predecessors.  I helped set up excel files that they updated monthly for both power billing and
	gas nominations to satisfy the contract specifics.  This would house all the information that is being 
	requested.  

	I also noticed that I was not seeing the scheduled monthly Maintenance payments being made to NNG.
	The contract also defines that ENA is paying NNG $320,000 annually at the end of July for the on-peak
	power charges from Midland Power.

      You'll like.  It is fun once you get past some of the boring basics.
   I
      have been playing about 2 years.  I don't practice as much as I
   should,
      however if I turn my amp up loud enough, the noise will cover all my
      mistakes.  What type of music do you want to play?  Let me guess,
   Heavy
      Metal!

   bought
      a
         fingering chart book (if that's what it's called - i don't know)
         yesterday.

         Nothing real exciting.  After Thursday, I was a little burnt so I
      stayed
         home on Friday.  Saturday I just went over to a friends house.  He
      plays
         the drums and I play a little guitar so we had a jam session (or
   at
         least
         we jammed as much as two corporate attorneys could).  Sunday I
   went
         furniture shopping and purchased a couch for my house.  I got
   kinda
      of
         sick
         of have no furniture in my living room. Now my house won't seem so
         pathetic
         when people visit.

         Yea, I have been to Teala's.  Can't say I have ever had the mango
         margarita
         though.  I will have to try when I get a chance.  Sounds fruity!!

            Hey Gerald!!  The weekend was good.  I went to a wedding on
      Saturday,
            but I
            was bored almost all day Sunday.  My boyfriend and I finally

   your
         friends
            on
            Thursday.  I wimped out Thursday and Friday - pretty pathetic.
      But I
            give
            you props just for considering GK 2 weeks in a row!!  Did you

            Hi Jennifer,  How was your weekend?  Did you do anything
   exciting?
      I
            was
            invited to go with some friends to the GK on Friday night, but
   I
         thought
            that two Fridays in a row would be pushing my luck, so I begged
      off.

Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

To all,
 
Unfortunately I will only be available in pockets of time today.  I am catching a flight back to Buffalo through Philly at 11:33 pm (ET).  I will be landing in Houston at 4:51 pm.  I would recommend that following steps be done in order to close the transaction today.
 
1.  Lisa, Please get Rick Buy's signature for the DASH  -- assuming that Reliant is the counterparty.
 
2.  Eva or Lisa - Please leave a draft version of the DASH with Tammi Schoppe, Louise Kitchen's assistant. (You might want to tentatively set up an appointment on her calendar.)
 
3. Gerald - Please check with Reliant's legal , Steve Williams (?), as well as Ken Bradlee and have them send back final  email versions of all appropriate documents.
 
4. When we have received the appropriate email from Reliant - get on Louise's calendar and have Gerald prepare executables.
 
5. When the DASH and the Board Resolution document have been signed by Louise and all other relevant individuals listed, send the executables to Reliant.
 
6. Please have Reliant wire the money after signing the contracts and get a confirmation number.
 
7. Upon receiving a confirmation number related to the wire transfer, please have Julie sign the returned executables from Reliant.
 
Then, have a glass of wine on me!  I will be calling during the day.  My cell is 713-302-4187.
 
Regards, Jean

Subject:	Master Netting Agreements Reminder

Reminder - If you are working on a Master Netting Agreement, you also need to understand what type of entities are being included in the netted group.  On the power side, there are regulatory restrictions on a regulated utility from becoming a guarantor of the debts of unregulated companies;  accordingly,  an MNA with a regulated utility and other unaffiliated parties on its side will not work, particularly if you are posting collateral on a fully netted basis.  In this case, the only option would be to keep the underlying margining agreements in place (no new global collateral annex) and have the MNA only be a cross default and acceleration and  possible setoff (just in case the money is going the right way and/or just in case it works).  Mary is working on a new draft of the MNA to be used if we are not superceding the underlying margining terms. Thanks

Steve, we may not need to have that meeting between ourselves and Bridgeline regarding the R/W, easements, etc on Crawfish property (at least not this week).  Roger Westbrook has been communicating directly with the Bridgeline R/W guy, and they have determined that they require the following items.  I appreciate your help (or Daigle's) in putting these together for execution.  Please communicate directly with Roger to acquire the appropriate descriptions.  

While we have Bridgeline's attention on this, let's try not to lose momentum.  Thanks for any pressure you can put on Daigle to get this done.

Pat, please note the changes I have made in red to the email copy below:

Subject: Crawfish Agreements


As far I know, BHLP needs the following documents from Enron for the
facilities at Crawfish.
	1)  Surface Easement for roughly 1acre OR Special Warranty Deed for Sale of roughly 2acres.
	2)  Surface Easement near River Road for existing facilities. 
(Parcel VI on Survey)(Equilon shared site).
	3)  Road Ingress/Egress (limestone road shown on Exhibit G.  Need Easement)
	4)  ROW easements for:
		A. 16" Pipeline (1609) going northeast from the surface
facilities to the river.
		B. 16" Pipeline (1609) going northwest from the surface
facilities to Taft (depends on land owned by Enron.  Not on Exhibit G).
		C. 16" Pipeline (1607) coming from the southwest, going to
the surface facilities (depends on land owned by Enron).
		D. Dual 16" Pipelines going northeast from Parcel VI across
the Mississippi River.
	5)  8" pipeline will be abandoned.  See detail on Exhibit G.  Bridgeline to determine if abandon in place or remove.
	6)  Abandon 3" and 16" pipelines.  See exhibit G.
	7)  Parcels III and IV on Exhibit G will be abandoned.

Bridgeline to furnish individual certified plats for each item 1 through 4 above.

I've asked Engineering to confirm the footprint needed for the new
tanks, then have it surveyed.  For the price that was mentioned, I
prefer to buy the land; but we need to finalize the details.  That needs
to be resolved before:
	- I can build the new tanks, 
	- we can finalize the ROW documents.   

Once you have reviewed this, please call me. I'm sure that both of us
would like to move forward.

Thanks.

<http://www.unitedway.org/local.cfm?id=46377&zip=77002>

EWS has been asked to sponsor the Center for the Retarded, for this year's Days of Caring.  We need your help to make this effort a success.  

What are the Days of Caring?

United Way Days of Caring began in 1992 with 800 volunteers from area corporations.  The Days of Caring for the year 2000 grew to over 7,000 participants from the Houston area.  During the annual Days of Caring, volunteers put their caring into action by working at agency locations.  Donors are able to see for themselves the work done by the agencies, meet those who are served and learn more about how their investment in the United Way impacts our community.

What agency are we sponsoring?

The Center - Serving Persons with Mental Retardation   

 Serving Bay Area and Fort Bend, Harris, Montgomery and Waller Counties  
 Provides opportunities for persons with mental retardation to maximize their potential for independence.   
 Services include: adult activity centers, education, community living options, employment and health services.   
 For more information, visit the website at: www.cri-usa.org <http://www.cri-usa.org> 

How long will I be away from the office? 

You have 2 shifts to choose from.  We will provide your transportation to and from the location.  The morning shift will start at 8:15 a.m., Friday August 10th, with a kick-off from the Office of the Chair.  The bus will then leave at 8:30 a.m. and will drop you in front of The Center.    The bus will return you to Enron by 11:30 a.m. where you can grab your complimentary sack lunch from Chick-Fil-a.  

The Body Shop has been generous enough to let us use its shower facility for anyone who chooses an outdoor activity.

What will I need to do?

You have the option to sign up for a variety of activities.  These activities include Landscaping, Heavy Cleaning, Light Construction, Painting, Arts & Crafts, Playing Bingo, and Hosting a Party (providing baked goods, punch, and snacks).

Will I need to bring any equipment / supplies?

Depending on the activity you choose, you may be asked to provide equipment / supplies.  The necessity for supplies may range from construction paper and scissors to rakes, brooms, and gloves.  Your Business Unit representative will follow-up with more details.

Contest Information -

For everyone in EWS who participates in the Days of Caring, your name will be entered into a drawing  to win 1 of 5 American Express Gift Certificates. 

As I stated earlier, WE NEED YOU TO MAKE THIS EVENT A SUCCESS. 

      

How do I volunteer?

	Gerald,
	Generally there has been a gas sales agreement with ENA.  Given that this transaction was done as ENA, it may have been handled
	differently.  What contractual provisions exist for the gas delivered by NNG to ENA?

Subject:	NNG Hubbard

Stuart,  I reviewed the contract files on the Hubbard Transaction and found the following agreements:

All these contracts are in Enron North America Corp.'s name

1.  Compression Services Agreement dated June 29, 2000 (I worked on this one.  We basically restated the existing Compression Services Agreement with NNG to revise conversion factors to allow NNG to deliver ENA more gas and thus allow ENA to mark more earnings.  NNG was able to book $2 mil of these earning as a fee paid by ENA to NNG in consideration for termination of the existing Compression Services Agreement)  This agreement has a provision for submission of a purchase offer by NNG to ENA for purchase of the motor and interconnection facilities.  No specific numbers are listed and the terms would have to be mutually agreeable.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy).  Thus it is not terminated.  If ENA fails to provide HP there are LD payments due up to a maximum of $200,000 per contract year.  Term is through January 31, 2018.

2.  First Amended and Restated Operations Agreement dated November 1, 1997.  NNG operates the electric driver for ENA.  Fee is $44,000 per year with an escalater.  Term is through November 30, 2017 (This works with the term of the CSA above.  Even though physical operations stop in November, gas still flows for another two month period).  

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

3.  Agreement for Purchase of Power dated March 31, 1995 as amended on November 19, 1997.  ENA purchases electricity from Midland Power Cooperative.  Term is through December 31, 2017.

	No events of default specifically listed (including bankruptcy). 

4.  Master Lease Agreement dated March 31, 1995.  ENA leases the electric motor driver and appurtenant equipment from General Electric Capital Corporation. This agreement has a 10 year term with an option to purchase the equipment after year 8 for a fixed amount of $944,875.69.

	Bankruptcy of ENA is an event of default.  GE must provide notice that they wish to declare an event of default.  If they declare an event of default, GE could enter the premises and take possession of the equipment and hold ENA liable for the "Stipulated Loss Value" of the equipment and all rentals due thereunder.  The Stipulated Loss Value calculated is set forth on a Table attached to the agreement.

Let me know if you would like copies of any of these agreements.

We do not need to include the well information in the confirmation. We have it now, but we will only use it for tracking purposes.

Judy,

Does that mean that we don't need all the wellhead / meter information ? Because I still have not got any meter information from your group.

Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Judy, the confirm language looks good, but the price is wrong - should be Index less .0175 for the first 1700/d and  Gas Daily flat for gas over that amount each month. We can put a MDQ if you want to...but the only way we would have more gas is if they add another well and we could reject it I think if we wanted to based on it not being w/in the dedication......Do you want to talk more about that? Thanks.

Gerald,

Please review the attached completed confirmation for EEX E&P and forward to Ellen Wallumrod to send to the customer if you approve.  We need to get this to the customer today if at all possible.

Per Jill Zivley, there is not an MDQ, but she will work with the customer on a monthly basis for volumes above 1700.  Please let me know if we need to adjust the confirm based on that information.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.

I spoke with Nelson to verify how this language should be used for W&T Offshore and Spinnaker. On those confirmation, the Buyer's Keep Whole language should NOT be included. Please let me know if you have questions. I would like to see those confirmations before they are sent to the customers.

Thanks,

Attached is the revised Keep Whole Language.  I assume this language would completely replace the Variance langauge that we currently insert in our GTCs and any Replacement Price Differential Language in our Pooling Point and Wellhead GTCs.  I.e. this will be the only measure of damages for these deals.  If this is not correct, let's discuss. 

Ellen,  This language would be the same language use for the W&T Offshore and Spinaker deals.  Is this correct Nelson?

Please review before sending out to make sure I have correctly captured your business deal.

Master Netting Group:

I just want to personally thank all of you for all of your hard work the past few weeks in addressing our counterparties' requests for Master Netting Agreements.  We have been able to sign up a number of them as a result of your efforts and have managed to keep certain counterparties from cutting us off in trading.  	Thanks again for your efforts and for putting up with one fire drill after another!  Hopefully we all learned alot in the process.

Ed and Gerald,

Brian and I spoke with Randy Curry of Bridgeline earlier today regarding a deal that we are trying to put together in order to sell the pad gas (in place) from Storage Caverns #13/#14.  During that conversation, Randy indicated that: (i) ENA's default under its storage and transport agreements with Bridgeline impacts the Bridgeline partnership itself (and that there are certain side agreements that spell this out) and (ii) Bridgeline would reject any efforts by ENA to remove its gas inventories from storage facilities owned by Bridgeline.  Bridgeline contends that ENA is permitted to pay all past due amounts and provide adequate assurances for future payment on its storage and transport deals as there is a bankruptcy order in place that allows the debtors to pay common carrier liens and warehouseman's liens.  I asked Randy whether he had sought a lawyer's opinion regarding whether Bridgeline could be properly classified as a common carrier and/or warehouseman - he said that he had.

Gerald please advise regarding Randy's assertions above.

Ed, please let me know if you are already looking into either of these matters.  If not, my guess is that you will be interested in hearing more.

Regards

Stuart

David/Richard:

I hope you had a good time on the hunt and made it home in time for the service.  We'll try to do another hunt behind dogs later in the season.  To follow up on our discussions with PNP, I have proposed a Letter Agreement which defines one basic structure for the deal.  This is definitely open to discussion and I would like your input.

When Richard visits tomorrow, I would like to review the pro forma we have developed for the transaction.  The pro forma is a work in process - but provides a good start on understanding the total project value as well as the return to each party.  If we can agree the basic structure of the deal, we then need to agree the commercial assumptions and how the revenue stream from the sale of oil and gas is to be provided.

After you have had a chance to review, I will arrange a visit to take any comments.

Regards,
Brian

Are you Ready2Go ?

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employee's and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2249B).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a brief training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Thank you for your time.

Here is the information that you requested.

Counter party:  

Encore Acquisition Partners

Address:  

777 Main St., Ste. 1400
Fort Worth, TX 76102

Scope:  

The scope of this project is to analyze, develop and propose a compression services package that will optimally manage Encore's current and future horsepower requirements.  In order to do this we will need to explain our financial structures and gain access to information pertaining to their compression facilities and existing power agreements. 

Email me with the completed CA so that I can forward it on to the client.

Thanks

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

I agree with Chip but question which would be faster.  I think both routes are identical in terms of result but may differ in the amount of time needed to accomplish them.  I believe that we are allowed to enter into new agreements, without court approval, provided that they are in the ordinary course.  My understanding of the process for assuming an existing contract is that it typically requires some oversight/approval by the bankruptcy court/creditors committee and further it may require the debtor to rectify any prior defaults (I am less sure of this one).  Obviously, a bankruptcy lawyer should be consulted.  By carbon copy of this email, I am asking Gerald Nemec to run this to ground with one of the A&K or Weil lawyers.

I spoke with Duane Harris from PB-KBB (Tommy Smith's boss) regarding the Napoleanville work.  I briefed him on how the pre and post bankruptcy invoices will be treated.  They are willing to keep working provided we do the following:

1.	Provide an accounting of what invoices are pre and what invoices are post bankruptcy - so we can get on the same page with them regarding the numbers.

2.	Put in place a new contract between PB-KBB and the Estate to cover post bankruptcy work.  Please work with G. Nemec to develop the form of the contract that we want to propose to the cash committee.

3.	He also wants to have a discussion with regard to the pre-bankruptcy invoices, but he realizes he is an unsecrued creditor with respect to this work.

Lets you, Stuart and I chat by the end of the day to see where you are on this. 

Thanks,

Answers to some of your questions in the document.  The 4BCF Date is the date that is 114 days after the last Pad Gas Payment.  The last Pad Gas Payment was scheduled to be made in November sometime I think.  However, we have not yet made this payment.

G - It seems like CSU is pretty set on using their paper.  Let me know what you think.

Tyrell, 

CSU is pretty picky about using our contracts for these deals.  There are several sections that we must have in a contract and those are all covered in our version.  Could you ask your legal if they could live with our contract?  If there is any language they would like to add, we can cover that ground as well.  Let me know if this will work for you.

Marcus,
Sorry for the delay . . . it's difficult to get folks moving during holiday
weeks.  Anyhow, our legal group has indicated that they would like to have
a Master Firm Agreement in place with CSU to which we can attach concise
Transaction Agreement Exhibits detailing specific deals.  I have attached
the Master Firm Agreement for your review and will follow shortly with the
Transaction Agreement Exhibit for our swing deal.

(See attached file: Colorado Springs Utilities.doc)

Please let me know your thoughts on the Master Firm and don't hesitate to
call with any questions, comments, and/or concerns.

Thanks,
Tyrell Harrison

Gerald,

One more question:  I assume the new keep whole GTCs are primary term.  There is no mention in either the Confirm or the GTC language.  Can you please confirm?   Again, I need something to default to in the template I am setting up.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Gerald,

On the Wellhead purchase GTC with keep whole provisions, the payment date is either the last day of the month following delivery or the 25th day of the month following delivery.  I understand this date will be decided on a deal-by-deal basis, but I still need to have a date to input into our Global Contracts template.  Since ENA Upstream is the purchaser, I'd prefer to use the last day of the month for our template (for cash flow purposes), but I'd like you to confirm which one we should use as a default of sorts.

I also wanted to check on the status of the Point Specific GTC you've been working on.  Are we close to having a final version?  Please remember that I need to be copied on any versions of the GTC or confirmation, since that data drives what we input in Global Contracts.

Please get back to me as soon as possible (I'm setting up the template in Global Contracts right now).  Feel free to call me at x30569 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
SBR

Gerald:

Attached is another draft of the Purchase and Sale Agreement with
several revisions.  I revised the property description because the
description I used before was supplied by the appraiser and was not
definite enough.  I inserted the Tax ID numbers and correct addresses
and deleted the L.P. as an intervenor.  I also set up the Cash Sale so
that it could be executed in counterparts rather than at a single closing.

The survey plat supplied with the Appraisal report appears to for the
5.081 acre tract of land previously sold.  Do you have a survey of the
Subject Property?

I will send this revised draft to the Police Jury on Monday.

Keith

Provided, however, that it is not the purpose of this Section 4.4 to provide for or to permit the 
setoff of obligations by ENRON against Counterparty for obligations of the PNM Gas Services

for the obligations of the Counterparty under this Master Agreement.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Due to the overwhelming response from Enron employees and contractors, today's blood drive appointments are completely full, and there are a large number of you who still wish to donate blood.  We are working diligently with the M. D. Anderson Blood Bank to schedule another day for blood donations, and you will be notified as soon as that date is secured.  For those of you who are interested in giving, please continue to either call the Enron Health Center, ext. 3-6100, to get your name on the waiting list or go to the donation line in front of the building.  We recognize and are grateful to the many of you who are wanting to give blood today, but ask that you be patient and understand our inability to accept walk-in donations at this time.  

Thanks again for the tremendous outpouring of concern.

      Gerald, this will confirm our telephone conversation earlier this
morning in which you advised me that Enron/LRCI would have no objection
to my firm representing Reliant in connection with the referenced
matter.  I shall look forward to working with you in bringing this
matter to a successful conclusion.  Should you have any questions as
this matter proceeds, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Gerald -
See attached for more changes (in BLUE).  Per my earlier phone message, I removed the sentence on gas compression in Section 8 and further clarified the "electric only" tone of the section.  
 
Please advise.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

Lisa, Your changes look fine to me.  I added the sentence to make it clear that ECS would not be owning and operating that portion of the equipment.  It wasn't clear to me from the section which indicate we will be arranging for the installation of the compressors.

Gerald,
Thanks for your comments.  I've made a few revisions (hightlighted in BLUE); in particular, I've clarified the Capital Expenditures Section 4 (we want to differentiate the transmission line from the remainder of the capital estimates).  We are still working on the items in red and in yellow.
 << File: Oakhill LOI (10-3-01) Lisa.doc >> 
One question for you in Section 8.  Why did you add the following sentence "Oakhill would maintain ownership and responsibility for all maintenance of the reciprocating gas compressors throughout the contract term"?  Its not clear to me why we'd include a sentence on gas compression.  Let me know.

Thanks, Lisa

Gerald,

Here is what I have so far for the draft confirmation for Mariner. As we discussed, I need you to add the language that states that at the Seller's option, we will release a given property for the remainder of the term of the contract if we are unable to move the gas from that property due to transportation.

Thanks,
Judy

As Andrea Settanni hinted in her e:mail of last Tuesday, June 12, 2001, FERC has acted on the FPA Section 203 Filing and issued the attached Order.  It would now appear that the primary time consuming matters that remain to be addressed as conditions to closing are as follows:

1.	Obtaining NCUC no further action authorization;
2.	Satisfying ourselves that all that can be done has been done in terms of Enron Corp. Guaranty/LC replacement-substitution;
3.	Finalizing the form of EEI Master to be put in place for Contractor Transactions between EPMI & NCPH (Heather has talked to credit about terms that need to be 	finalized;  
4.	Arrange for Bring Down Certificates on 3 Title Policies; and
5.	Updating any Representations or Warranties that are/were not true as of the SPA signing date.

If any of you are aware of other significant/time consuming pre-closing items, please let me know. 

It appears that Item 1. might be satisfied early next week, or by the following week at the latest.  The remainder of the items, together with preparation of closing deliverables could be accomplished within that time frame as well.  I will attempt to set up a meeting following Heather Kroll's return to Houston on Wednesday, June 20, to discuss completion of pre-closing matters.

Jay Sonnenberg will be updating and distributing a more formal Closing Checklist in the meantime.

Please call if you have any questions.

We need to figure out how to play this out ASAP so that we know how much cash needs to be sent out.  My guess is that we would prefer to have Bridgeline pay Dow directly.  I have a voicemail from the guy at Dow and would like to get back with him on our plan.  Let me know.  Thanks.

Brian, Karen Gruesen, and I had a discussion this morning with Bridgeline.  We agreed that they owed and would pay the lease fees, but  the remainder of the charges were not subject to reimbursement.  The only issue was would they reimburse us or pay Dow directly.  They are concerned about netting issues.

Who keeps the books for Bridgeline?  In other words, how can we find out if they have paid their $1,000,000?  Please let me know.

Subject:	Dow Invoice

I have reviewed the Dow Agreement wrt to the Dow Invoice Dated November 29, 2001 and have found the following

1.  2Q Lease Fee - $115,000
    3Q Lease Fee - $195,500.

Section 3.3 of the Agreement (as amended) provides for a lease fee of $25,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF until the date that gas injections begin in Enron's well (which was July 31, 2001) and a fee of $50,000 per BCF based on 4.6 BCF thereafter.  The fees are assessed per calendar quarter.  The above fees look to be OK.

2.  Final Mining Fee - $23,362.40
     Final Land Purchase Offset - ($47,013.75)

Section 6.5 through 6.8 of the Agreement provide for a detailed calculation of the Brine Fee due Dow based on the amount of salt removed from Enron's new well and a corresponding credit back to Enron for the conveyance of a 57.865 acres tract of land to Dow from Enron.  The credit is also based on the amount of Salt removed from Enron's new well.  Dow should provide detail on the salt removed and someone would need to go through the calcs in 6.5 through 6.8 to verify the above charges.

3.  Power Credit Adjustment - $16,500

I find no basis for this in the contract.


Under Schedule 3 to the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P. partnership agreement, Bridgline is obligated to bear all obligations under the Dow Agreement up to a maximum of $1,000,000 per year.  So Bridgeline should be paying these costs, assuming they haven't already paid up to $1,000,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Maureen,

I think that Janel Guerrero and Gerald Nemec might be getting into Myrtle Beach,SC around that time.  I have cc'd them on this email so you guys can start a dialogue about getting to Ocean Isle, NC in one car.

Eric,

As we discussed, we need to take the most recent invoice from PB-KBB (the contractor that is responsible for injection of gas into Napoleonville) and have them bifurcate the bill into pre-bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy amounts (using 12/2 as the date of bankruptcy).  In the meantime, please prepare a Cash Use Request Form for the post-bankruptcy amount (Doug Sewell can assist you on this) for consideration by the Cash Committee.  [CHIP PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE COURSE OF ACTION]

Also, please forward Gerald's draft of new agreement to PB-KBB for their consideration along with any proposed changes to the scope of work description.

Gerald!

Here is another Bridgeline outgoing guaranty that we would like to have reviewed and executed.   The amount of the guaranty should be $1.00MM.  I will be happy if you can kindly give me a call, I have a few minor questions on some of the comments.

Attached is the Guaranty that has been review by our legal department with
the changes that they requested.

Trevor  I also ran across a few contracts in  the name of Bridgeline Gas
Distribution. There hasn't been any activity on these contracts over the
past year. Should we take Bridgeline Gas Distribution off of the approve
bidders list? If not we will need it listed on the guaranty as well.

Thanks

Troy, can you call Jill Mearz with TIE and get the same contract information for Gerald. Please forward the information to Gerald as well. Jill (972) 455-2980

Gerald, we are bidding on gas for several IPP's with this company. They are wanting to get a copy of our contract ASAP to begin the initial review process. When Troy forwards you the contract information what would be the turn around for a hard copy and email I could send them.

Don?t  you think that the redaction of article 13 of the Agency & Management  Agreement will be better this way::
 
IF  ENA BECOMES LIABLE TO CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE EL PASO AGENCY  AGREEMENT FOR ANY REASON, WHETHER ARISING BY NEGLIGENCE OR INTENDED CONDUCT OR  OTHERWISE, , IN NO EVENT SHALL ENA'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER EXCEED THE AGGREGATE OF  THE SERVICES FEE PAID TO ENA HEREUNDER FOR

Dear Carolyn:  Would you please be so kind as to see what information we have in our files regarding Enron Gas Processing and HPL, each of whom owned a plant and gathering system, respectively, which were sold to Encinal and Cerritos.  Do we have a copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement dated 2/10/95?  I'm looking for this on behalf of Ann Elizabeth White, who went to AEP with HPL.  

Please advise, and thanks,
Mary

Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company."

S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales."

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

Thought I would ask a more specific question.  Do you know of any transactions which Enron may be in default due to recent circumstances?  I'm excluding trading deals.  Maybe some of the asset management deals?  Joint venture companies (enovate?)?

Thanks,

Kay

Louise,
 
On Monday, prior to my leaving for Buffalo,  I spoke with Dave Gorte and was informed that since the sale of the Napoleonville Land was greater than $2.5 MM, it is categorized as a diversiture requiring a DASH.  
 
Since the negotiations were quite contentious between Reliant, Texas Brine and Enron - we (Eva, Lisa and myself) had worked with Mr. Gorte to create multiple versions of the DASH.  It was not until Wednesday afternoon that Reliant was the chosen "victor."  In addition, since I felt you were apprised of the deal and Mr. Gorte had not informed me of an appropriate process, Lisa had waited until we knew who the counterparty was before getting on your schedule.
 
Unfortunately, this meant Wednesday afternoon around 4 pm, but we had been informed by Tammi Schoppe that you were available until 5 pm. Even though the banks were closed, I had wanted to sign the executables on Wednesday so Reliant would not have an opportunity to change their mind over the holiday weekend.  It was certainly not our intent to have you not appropriately briefed regarding the transaction.
 
I will be flying back to Houston today and will be landing around 5 pm.  Both Eva Rainer and Lisa Druzbik are in today and I am leaving instructions to (hopefully) close the deal today.  Julie Gomez will be signing on my behalf -- for detailed questions regarding the negotiations please refer to Eva.  My cell is 713-302-4187.
 
Regards, Jean

At 4pm on Wednesday Liza arrived with the DASH.  It had not been circulated prior to that and there was no-one available to discuss the deal as Eva was not in the office.  Please  have someone ready to discuss this deal and circulate the DASH in advance of when you want it signing.

4pm on Wednesday with no briefing on the deal didn't give enough time to complete a DASH.

Louise, 

Tomorrow, I am flying to Buffalo, NY for Thanksgiving with my father.  As such, for the potential sale of the Napoleonville Land, Julie Gomez will sign on my behalf for LRCI Inc. after both appropriate commercial, accounting and legal parameters have been met. The status is as follows:

Texas Brine has been informed that another counterparty has presented a premium bid of $ 3 MM and has the opportunity to counter.  Texas Brine was the first counterparty to try to acquire the land at $2.35 MM. 
Reliant has slowed the transaction close due to their legal changes to the "Act of Sale" document.  As such, Gerald Nemec (my legal) is reviewing the document in conjuction with our Louisiana counsel as well as other relevant internal legal groups (i.e. litigation and environmental). 


I am confident that the land will get sold and was hoping to close the transaction prior to my leaving.  However, this bidding "war" has the potential for ENA to extract an even higher auction price.  The approximate book value of the land is $1.4 MM.

I can be reached via Blackberry or cell (713-302-4187).  Eva Rainer, Manager, is also an appropriate person to contact for any questions.

Regards, Mrha

Gerald - 
This afternoon, the Compression team is headed to Chicago for a Friday meeting with Nicor.  We have not yet progressed to the point of providing Nicor a LOI.  Instead, one of the items they plan to discuss is the attached outline of the LOI in order to give Nicor an indication of what would be included if and when the deal progresses.  

Could you review the attached LOI Outline and provide any comments?

 

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

Gerald, sorry I haven't replied back. It's my busy season at work. You know
she came last Saturday. She did an awesome job!!! Thank you so much for the
info. I was doing a volunteer home repair project, so I didn't get to meet
her. But, I'm sure next Saturday I will impress her with my expertise of
the Spanish language (like I impressed the citizens of  Spain, or at least
the people at Joy Enslava!)

How's work? I hope things start working out. Between you, my dad and many
others, a lot of money is being lost. Dad has to exercise 2,000 shares by
end of the year and another 3,000 in January. He's lost over a million
dollars! Hopefully, we can all get together this weekend and drink our
sorrows away!!! After all this time, I'm still waiting to get an offer from
the other side of the company. I think it's around the corner though. Talk
to you soon.

washes dishes, cleans bathrooms and kitchen, she also washes my clothes,
bed sheets, and towels.   They do speak very little English.  Her husband
speaks better, but they may have you speak with their son, unless you want
to use your Spanish and pretend you are back in Madrid.  Use my name.  If
she has availability, her and her husband will come out to the house and
take a look.  You can go over with her what you want done and then agree on
the price.  I give her a key to my house and she comes when I am not there.
A lot of people I know use her and she is trustworthy.  Feel free to ask if
you have questions.

   Thanks, G. I'll talk to you tomorrow then. Also, let me know what all
   she
   does for you. You pay $50 per cleaning, don't you? Thanks! We will have
   to
   get together this weekend.

   Hey Jen,  The number is at the house.  I will send it to you tomorrow.
   The
   GK was fun.  We went to another similar type place called the Marquis
   II.
   They were both pretty cool.  Kinda of dives.  I was pretty polluted by
   the
   end of the night.  No game this weekend.  We'll have to grab beers
   again.
   Later.

      Gerald, could you give me the name and phone number of the woman who
      cleans
      your house? We're going to hire her if she's available. Sorry we
   didn't
      show up at the GK. Eric was lame and wanted to go home. Was it fun?
   Do
      you
      have a football game to go to this weekend? Talk to you soon.

Gerald,

Haswell will be working tomorrow. He will not be in Thursday or Friday. I can call him tomorrow and that will give you the remainder of the afternoon to circulate your responses. I have to leave shortly for a dentists appointment of long standing. You could call Haswell if you prefer, but I think it better that I act as buffer. You can always fire me if I screw up.

I have changed the dates and prices in these agreements, but those should be the only changes necessary.  Let me know if either of you see any other changes that are necessary.

Brian, let's get together this afternoon and see if we can organize our other capacity release transactions that need to be completed by December 1.  Does 3:00 your time work?

	Several agreements with PG&E entities as you might imagine, none with this particular entity - Old agreement  (12/99) with PG& E Corporation re ENA acquisition of PG&E affiliates PG&E Gas Transmission, Texas Corporation and its subsidiaries and PG&E Gas Transmission Teco, Inc. and its subsidiaries expires 12/2001 - contained a no-hire provision which expired 12/2000.

	Several with PG&E National Energy Group relating to purchase and/or sale of generating assets, but each is transaction specific and contains no restrictive provisions.

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be "Payment by wire on the 25th Day". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

As part of the recently negotiated agreement with United Parcel Service (UPS), Enron employees may now utilize two new letter centers when sending packages after hours.  These letter centers are located in Three Allen Center, on the ground level, behind the down escalator, near the U.S. Postal Services self-service area and in the Enron Building, at the back of the escalators near the automated teller machine.  

Letter-sized envelopes, as well as boxes up to 18"x 13" x 3" can be shipped via Next-Day Air, Second-Day Air, Third-Day Select, UPS International and UPS World-Wide Express Service.  

In order to eliminate service disruptions, please apply a completed label to the envelope or box, in accordance with previously communicated shipping instructions.  When utilizing the shipping documentation available at the letter center, please include the Enron account number and your company code and cost center in the reference fields.  

Pick up times at the letter centers are 7:45 p.m. for Three Allen Center and 8:00 p.m. for the Enron Building, Monday through Friday.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Glenn Lewis, Global Strategic Sourcing contract manager at 713-646-7512.

Mr. Nemec,

We have added language from David Marshall.  Please review and advise if
this is acceptable.  Also, I would like to request filing a memorandum in
the Courthouse instead of the Agreement.  Our intent is to start
construction  by October 1, 2001.

Thanks for your assistance.

Do you have about 30 minutes to meet with Andrew and I to discuss a CA for our Crestone transaction?

Gerald,
Dave Gutierrez with Hanover provided the following response regarding the documents he forwarded to me regarding the GE Capital (Operating Lease).  
I believe that I get the picture,  but it seems that he would have made the changes he has referenced.  

Lets discuss,

Mark,

The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction. Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee. Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE. Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction, of which Hanover shall invoice.

The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents you'll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor. Additionally, Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE.

Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues. Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs. which keep this transaction as an operating lease/off balance sheet transaction. This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction.

I'd be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns.



>>> "Knippa, Mark" <Mark.Knippa@ENRON.com> 06/22/01 03:52PM >>>

Not sure I get the picture.  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station (equipment, packaging & installation).  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation, bumper to bumper, for the 10 year term of the agreement.

What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services, delivery, use & operation, insurance, the return of equipment, etc. that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover.  Is ECS
expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover?  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform?

Eric,
We need to get the physical gas delivery issue resolved.  TW is scheduled to deliver to ECS which was contracted
with ENA for a fixed price for each of the stations ( [Bisti & Bloomfield or Kachina] and Gallup ).  The total volume
for Dec.01 according to TW and my best determination at this time is 342,560 MMBtu which ENA has not scheduled 
reportedly because they do not have a counter-party that will transact.  

This gas volume and the resulting cash flow into ECS Compression Co. LLC is a large portion of the monthly cash
flow required to fund the billing expenses.  

Gallup Sta. - 81,605 mmbtu's (Annual Charge Conversion) appears to be a $2.35/mmbtu price for this year
                   25,521 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge) appears to be a $2.44/mmbtu price for the term
	     107,126 mmbtu's for the month with a resulting $2.37144/mmbtu blended price

Bloomfield - 110,240 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)


Bisti -         125,194 mmbtu's (Compression Service Charge for Oct. power billed in Nov. 01)
                  342,560 mmbtu's for the month of Dec. to ECS

I'm not 100% sure of the pricing on these transactions but possibly with your information and Gerald Nemec's
input we can determine and confirm.



TK Lohman at TW called with a buyer for the Dec. 01 ECS gas.  Scott Walker w/ Richardson Products 817 810 9385
frequently buys TW's operational gas that is sold intra month.  The most direct method of handling the gas is to have
ENA sell the gas & the proceeds directly flow back to ECS (if that is possible).  ECS doesn't want the gas sale to 
roll into the ENA bankruptcy process.  Otherwise ENA would need to assign ECS the ability to sell the gas directly
but ECS would then need to execute a TW Pooling Agreement (or something) and there may be issues with ECS
marketing gas directly.  

Let me know what blanks you can fill in.

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.


Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.


I will wait to hear from you.

The DASH may need a legal risk rating attachment, and Gerald can draft that quickly if needed.  I hope it won't be needed, though, given that there is really nothing at risk....  Also, Dave Gorte may need to adjust it when he sees the DASH so I would begin by emailing a copy to him.

John, I am pleased to report that West Gas Orig has completed the permanent assignment of approx 47,000 MMBtu/day of El Paso Transport to Public Service of New Mexico. This capacity was assigned with varying start dates. late 02 and early 03, with no credit risk associated with this transaction as a condition of the assignment was an unconditional release of ENA.  ENA assigned this capacity at max rate ( which meets all FERC policy issues)and we were able to generate $3.0 MM of incremental value which was granted to Stephanie Miller from Mike Grigsby.  

In addition to the MTM of approx $ 3MM, this transaction reinforces the good working relationship between trading and marketing and may enhance ENA's trading position by removing some of the risks associated with this pipe. These risks include, flow rate risk, demand charge tariff changes, receipt point pool allocation risks, and potential MTM erosion and of course FERC/regulatory pressures.

Our work is nowhere near complete on this as we continue to create structures and discussion around the 200,000/day which is a little more complicated to shed. In the meantime our group continues to promote the placement of the remaining capacity either through other producers or generators and we anticipate the assignment of another  small package early next week. 

Thanks to those who helped out in this effort, including legal, regulatory, risk, structuring, trading and my origination team !!!    

regards, BT

Gerald,
My comments noted.  A few points:   as I read the contract, client is paying for the insurance cost of BCCKOP, and therefore should get full benefit of those policies, not just limited to claims attributable to BCCKOP's gross negligence/willful misconduct.  BCCKOP is in full control of the Facility and therefore should wear some financial risk for damage to it arising out of the Operating Services.  I have limited this to $100k per occurrence (our deductible for non-power gen assets is $1MM). I've also made them take deductibles under their policies for third party liability and employee injury risks (they had these on us originally), and specified that their GL cover include pollution legal liability (they had this on us also, but since it's a third party risk I think it should stay with the operator).
Call me if I've got this wrong or if we need to discuss further.   

Thx,

David
3-6847

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to "business as usual."   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the "International Travel" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

Gerald,

Please review the attached completed confirmation for EEX E&P and forward to Ellen Wallumrod to send to the customer if you approve.  We need to get this to the customer today if at all possible.

Per Jill Zivley, there is not an MDQ, but she will work with the customer on a monthly basis for volumes above 1700.  Please let me know if we need to adjust the confirm based on that information.

Thanks,
Judy Thorne

Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.

My latest recollection is that the Sorrento reps were going to provide the plat (Heidi Broussard indicated this).  We should get the original exhibits before we execute so Gerald/Roger can review them and include them in the package.

Hi Gerald!

We have received a request from El Paso to amend our existing guaranty  executed on June 1, 2000 for the benefit of several of its subsidiaries, to add another subsidiary (Southern Natural Gas Company) and to increase the amount by $2.5MM to $5.00MM.  

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Kortney-

Rhonda told me to contact you.  She submitted a request for a credit worksheet and draft EEI for New Smyrna Beach Utility.  I need to get back to him this week because I am going down there next week to discuss short and long term power contract opportunities.  If you have a moment, can you please check the status on that report.  I really would appreciate it.

Thank you very much,

Amanda Day

Subject: The History of Aggie Civilization - THIS IS GOOD!!


THE HISTORY OF AGGIE CIVILIZATION

The history of the aggie people is as confusing and complex as any culture
that exists on earth. Yet, unlike many peoples that have adapted and
evolved in response to external and internal influences over the centuries,
the aggies have largely remained true to their roots. And they're proud of
it. As a result of passing on their beliefs and practices over the years,
their behavior over time has been remarkably consistent. It is this
consistency that makes them an exciting and fascinating group to study.

Who are the aggies? The relationship between the aggies and morons, idiots,
and okies are often misunderstood. Contrary to widespread belief, the
aggies are considered, and consider themselves, a separate people from the
morons, idiots, and okies. Historically, the true stupidity of aggies has
largely dominated over, and outnumbered all three other groups combined.
The misconception that the four groups are related probably stems from the
fact that morons and idiots have imitated many rituals and behaviors
practiced by the aggies. However, aggies are a distinct group. [Although
recent evidence (Solomon, Shyster, et. al?1995) suggests that at one time,
probably early in the century, aggies and okies lived together and
interbred in parts of Southern Oklahoma and Texas, hence, Arkansas was
populated by their offspring.

What largely separates aggies from the others groups is their social
interaction. Unlike okies, idiots, and morons, aggies are highly social
creatures that tend to validate each other's views and beliefs. This can
lead to what scholars call a "groupthink delusion." It is believed that
these delusions are the glue that have bound aggies everywhere together
over the years.

The history of the aggie school of thought actually begins in ancient
Greece, with the early philospher Slocumedes, who was the first to
recognize that the absence of everything is equivalent to nothing. He had a
large number of stupid followers and much of his works is still passed on
from parent to child today. Stupicles, from Pheces, taught that all things
could be crushed by a large enough piece of wood. His students, known as
woodpeckers, practiced pet embalming, hand gestures, organized grunting and
mastered many techniques in consuming solid food through their nasal
cavities. Stupicles was also a prolific writer. Unfortunately, his twelve
volumes of philosophical works, which he wrote entirely in the sand on an
Egyptian beach, was lost during a high Mediterranean tide.

With the rise of the Roman Empire, many aggies sought the stability and
steady work afforded by slavery. The aggies however, made poor slaves, and
many were forced into Christianity for "entertainment of monks" and so that
they could be fed to the lions. Others were driven out of the Roman Empire
into Northern Europe where they settled many colonies. The void left by the
fall of the Roman Empire provided the aggies an opportunity to flourish
unhindered in Europe, hence Poland and France were populated.

The aggies didn't fare so well during the industrial revolution since the
philosophical and scientific frameworks of Descartes and Newton didn't give
much leeway to superstition and planned ignorance. More and more aggies
found themselves falling into the ranks of the working masses. Aggies
caused many early industrial accidents as they tried to fit into this
rapidly changing society, and evidence of their engineering prowess
remains, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Their ways and practices were
not appreciated in the new European culture; however, and increasingly many
aggies sought refuge across the ocean in America. That is those who didn't
wind up sinking their ships in the North Atlantic.

Part of the problem in identifying an aggie is that they look and act much
like anyone else until they do or say something decidedly stupid. Most
aggies don't think of themselves as morons, but rather as intelligent
individuals. This makes it very difficult to reason with an aggie. Stupid
acts can take many forms and vary in degree, but when an aggie commits one
it is unmistakable. The majority of the times a aggie turns out to be
nothing more than an inconvenience and source of humor to the innocent
bystander. These incidents are played out on city streets, supermarkets and
country Dairy Queens daily. However, there are times when these acts can
get out of hand and be devastating. It is always wise to be on alert and
prepared, and stay away from large stacks of logs, maroon-clad men wielding
binoculars, or people with shaved heads with swords.

At times you may find yourself in close proximity to an aggie in the midst
of a stupid spell. It is good advice not to approach them during an
incident unless accompanied by a trained professional. If you find that you
have no choice, then speak slowly and use small, soothing words. Never try
to outwit an aggie since they will only interpret that as a hostile and
aggressive act. Always let the aggie think they are superior. And under no
circumstances let your face or hands, pets or livestock near aggies mouth.

Keep in mind at all times, that although an aggie may seem intelligent and
civilized, they are not. It is an adaptive disguise developed over the
centuries.

Beware, be safe, and be orange!

Hook'em!

Gerald,

Can I get a standard CA put together for the following company:

Kinder Morgan CO2 Company, L.P.
500 Dallas
Suite 1100
Houston, TX  77002

The topic would be related to "certain compression assets in the SACROC Unit in Scurry County, TX."  I would like to get something to them ASAP, but no later than Monday as we are trying to meet with them on Friday morning next week.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Chris

Gerald,

Per our recent discussions, I need to get two CAs as outlined below:

Power Pipeline Partners
Address:
Power Pipeline Partners L.P.
10000 Memorial Drive
Suite 200
Houston, TX  77024-3409
Contact: Randy Schorre-Vice President & COO

I would like to put language in that protects either of us (non-circumvention?) for deal leads that are divulged to the other party if they were not already known to either party or could be reasonably found out in the "open" market.  I would also like to protect any proprietary deal structuring exposed by ECS.

Energy Transfer Group
Energy Transfer Company
2838 Woodside St.
Dallas, TX  75204
Contact: Kelcy L. Warren-Partner

I would like to put language in that protects either of us (non-circumvention?) for deal leads that are divulged to the other party if they were not already known to either party or could be reasonably found out in the "open" market.  I would also like to protect any proprietary deal structuring exposed by ECS as well as any electric motor drive technology exposed by the Energy Transfer Group.

Please start on putting these together and I will call you this afternoon.  I'm trying to get these out int the next day or so as I dragged my feet on this last week.  Sorry for the squeeze.

Thanks,
Chris

Dear Gerald:  I've received a notice re LRCI, Inc. - Crawfish plant.  We're delinquent on our "Form R6" and a penalty has been levied ($250.00).  I think this is the sort of regulatory matter that used to be handled by Juanita Marchant, who has moved to AEP.  Do you know who is in charge of handling these kinds of filings? 

Thanks,

Dear Legal Edge User,

If you are using the Legal Edge portal, please read this very important message.

We wanted to inform you that changes have been made to access the Enron Legal Edge portal.

What to Expect
When accessing the legal edge portal at http://legaledge.corp.enron.com/tibco/, you will be prompted for a user name and password as usual.  However, the user name has changed. You will no longer log into the portal with your legal edge passwords. Your access will be controlled via the standard Enron network directory. Therefore, effective immediately, you will login using the same user name and password used to login to your local workstation, your CORP ID. 

In addition to the different user name and password, there will be another change. Due to the application upgrade, any personalization you have made to the portal in the past will be lost. As those changes made are associated with your old legal edge portal user name, these personalizations will not automatically be applied to your CORP login. Therefore, do not be alarmed if you do not see all of the content you saw before. Simply, re-configure the portal for your CORP id to see the same content you saw before. Unfortunately, there is no way to get around this issue.

Benefits
- Only one user name password to remember (Use CORP network id and password)
- Not prompted for login for other applications participating in Single Signon
- Once you login once, you will never be required to login again from that workstation (unless you click the logout link)

Effective Date
The Legal Edge portal / Single Signon integration is effective Friday, November 9.

Forward Email to Administrative Staff
Please forward this email to your the administrative staff of your department, so they can access the portal site. Thank you.

Contact Us
If you would like to provide feedback for the Single Sign-On effort, send an email to sso@enron.com. If you have issues or concerns regarding this change, please contact the Resolution Center at ext. 3-1411.


Regards,
The Legal Edge and Single Signon Teams

Gerald - I think the doc needs to accomodate the possibility that we may offer several options (both transport and supply) before we finalize a structure. I picked 180 days for the term but it may need to extend for a longer period of time - perhaps 1 year.

Please call.

Thanks.

Could one of you please email me a copy of the standard template you use for Enfolio gas purchase agreements?  As we're getting more and more of those agreements, I'd like to add a template in Global Contracts.

Thanks!

Gerald:
When I got your form I converted it to WordPerfect 9.0 and then did the
revisions.  Apparently when I converted it back to Word, it didn't
"take".  I was able to convert it to Plain Text which I am attaching to
this message.  At least you can read it.  Please call with any questions

  President ___________________________, pursuant to Resolution No. _________
  of the Assumption Parish Police Jury dated __________, 2001, as "Buyer", each a
  "Party" and together, the "Parties."

       Whereas, Seller is the owner of the following described property located in
  Section 66, Township 13 South, Range 14 East, Assumption Parish, Louisiana:

       277.44' to a point, thence along the South property line a distance or
       260.02'to the point of beginning.

  containing 2.269 acres, more or less, as further depicted on the Survey Plat showing
  a 5.081 Acre Tract of Land Belonging to Louisiana Resources Co., dated February 22,
  1999, prepared by Harold J. Terracina, R.E., a copy of which is attached as Exhibit
  "A-1", and incorporated herein for all purposes, together whith all improvements
  located thereon and all appurtenances thereto, which property is hereinafter referred
  to as the "Subject Property."  The improvements located on the Subject Property
  bear Municipal Address ____________________________________, Louisiana,
  _________.

  Whereas, Seller is desirous of selling, and Buyer is desirous of purchasing,
  one hundred percent of Seller's interest in the Subject Property.

       Now Therefore, in consideration of the purchase price to be paid by Buyer to
  Seller and the mutual agreements contained herein, the Parties hereto acknowledge
  and agree as follows:

       1.   Description of Property.  Seller agrees to sell and Buyer agrees to
  purchase all of Seller's right, title and interest in the Subject Property. The actual
  sale of the Subject Property shall be by Cash Sale, containing special warranties,
  substantially in the form of Exhibit "B", attached hereto and incorporated herein for
  all purposes. Seller reserves the oil, gas, sulphur, salt and any other minerals, solid,
  liquid or gaseous, lying in, under or  which may be produced from the Subject
  Property, but this mineral servitude does not include the right to use the surface of
  the Subject Property for any mineral exploration, development or production.

       2.   Purchase Price.  The purchase price for the Subject Property to be paid
  by Buyer to Seller for the Subject Property shall be
  ___________________________________ Dollars ($ ____________) in cash due
  and payable by cashier's check made payable to Seller and delivered to Seller
  contemporaneously with the receipt by Buyer of the Cash Sale executed by Seller
  and vesting all of Seller's ownership interest in and to the Subject Property in Buyer.

       3.   Not an Option.  This is not an option, but it is an executory contract to
  buy and sell and it shall be so construed in all respects.  No Party may withdraw from
  this Agreement all Parties grant unto each other and reserve unto themselves the
  absolute right to demand specific performance of this Agreement.

       4.   Warranties by Seller.  Seller's interest in and to the Subject Property is
  and will be transferred to and accepted by Buyer "AS IS, WHERE IS" AND IN ITS
  PRESENT CONDITION AND STATE OF REPAIR.  BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
  SELLER HAS NOT MADE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS AND
  NEGATES, ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR
  IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE CONDITION OR QUALITY OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY,
  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES UNDER
  APPLICABLE LAW NOW OR HEREAFTER IN EFFECT, AND ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS
  WARRANTY REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. BUYER HAS INSPECTED THE
  SUBJECT PROPERTY AND HAS SATISFIED ITSELF AS TO THE PHYSICAL AND
  ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION, BOTH SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE, INCLUDING BUT
  NOT LIMITED TO CONDITIONS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE PRESENCE, RELEASE
  OR DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES.  BUYER EXPRESSLY WAIVES ALL
  CLAIMS TO ANY AND ALL REDHIBITORY DEFECTS AND/OR VICES AND ALL CLAIMS
  BASED ON THE FITNESS OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY FOR ANY INTENDED PURPOSE.
  BUYER IS RELYING SOLELY UPON ITS OWN INSPECTION OF THE SUBJECT PROPERTY
  AND BUYER SHALL ACCEPT ALL OF THE SAME IN AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" CONDITION.
  THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE FACE OF THIS PURCHASE
  AND SALE AGREEMENT AS TO THE SUBJECT PROPERTY.

       5.   INDEMNITIES.   BUYER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, REIMBURSE AND
  HOLD SELLER, ITS PARENT AND AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE "SELLER
  GROUP") FREE AND HARMLESS FROM ANY COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES (WHETHER
  ON ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH OR ON ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY
  DAMAGE) OR CAUSES OF ACTION AND LOSSES OF WHATSOEVER NATURE
  (INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT COSTS) ARISING OUT OF, OR IN
  CONNECTION WITH OR IN ANY WAY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OWNERSHIP OF THE
  SUBJECT PROPERTY, ON OR AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT
  SUCH COSTS, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, CAUSES OF ACTION OR LOSSES ARE DUE TO
  SELLER'S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

       6.   Proration of Taxes.    All property, ad valorem and similar taxes
  applicable to the Subject Property shall be prorated as of the Effective Date between
  Seller and Buyer. Such proration shall be final and shall not be the subject of
  adjustment after the final bills are rendered.  Buyer shall be responsible for all taxes,
  except income taxes of Seller, and prepare all tax filings, in respect to the Subject
  Property that are required to be paid or filed after the Effective Date.  To the extent
  that any such taxes filed and paid by Buyer are prorated hereunder, Seller shall
  promptly pay, upon of receipt of an invoice therefor from Buyer, its pro rata share of
  same.  All taxes, except Seller's income taxes, occasioned by reason of this sale,
  whether real, personal or mixed, shall be borne and paid solely by Buyer.  If, for the
  current ad valorem tax year, the taxable value of the Subject Property that is the
  subject of this Agreement is determined by a special appraisal method that allows for
  appraisal of the property at less than market value, the person to whom the property
  is transferred may not be allowed to qualify the Subject Property for that special
  appraisal in a subsequent tax year and the Subject Property may then be appraised
  at its full market value.  In addition, the transfer of the Subject Property or a
  subsequent change in the use of the property may result in the imposition of an
  additional tax plus interest as a penalty for the transfer of the change in the use of
  the land. Buyer acknowledges that there shall be no proration for, and Buyer shall be
  responsible for, payment of any "roll back" taxes or any other redetermination of
  property taxes assessed or relating to the year of the closing and years preceding the
  year of closing due or based upon any change in the use of the Subject Property at
  and after the closing hereunder.

  7.        Disputes.   Any dispute relating to this Agreement shall be resolved by
  binding, self-administered arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
  the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and all such proceedings shall be
  subject to the Federal Arbitration Act.  A single arbitrator shall be selected under the
  expedited rules of the AAA.  Only damages allowed pursuant to this Agreement may
  be awarded and the arbitrator shall have no authority to award consequential, treble,
  exemplary or punitive damages of any type under any circumstances regardless of
  whether such damages may be available under Louisiana law. The arbitrator shall
  have the power to award the remedy of specific performance. The results of such
  arbitration shall be conclusive and binding, provided, however, that both Parties shall
  have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such equitable relief as
  is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under this Agreement.
  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions, either Party may join the other
  Party to any action, suit or proceeding with respect to which the Party seeking such
  joinder is a defendant, if the other Party is required to defend, indemnify, and hold
  harmless such defendant in accordance with the terms of the provisions hereof.
  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
  having a jurisdiction hereof.

  8.      Entirety and Severability.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
  agreement of the Parties related to the purchase and sale of the Subject Property.
  There are no prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations (whether oral
  or written) affecting the Subject Property other than those herein expressed.  In case
  any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall for any reason
  be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
  or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision hereof, and this Agreement
  shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions had never
  been herein contained.

  9.      Governing Law.  THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED UNDER AND
  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA AND FEDERAL LAW
  AS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 7 ABOVE.

  10.     Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement, and all of the terms and
  provisions hereof, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
  hereto, and their respective successors and assigns.

  11.  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of
  counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and need not be signed
  by more than one of the Parties and all of which shall constitute one and the same
  agreement.

       12.  Further Assurances.  Each Party agrees that it will promptly perform all
  other acts and execute and deliver all other documents as may be necessary or
  appropriate to carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

       13.  Attorney's Fees.  In the event of the commencement of an arbitration
  proceeding or a breach of any of the provisions contained herein by either Party, the
  prevailing Party shall be entitled to collect from the other Party, as part of its
  damages for said breach, reasonable attorneys' fees associated with enforcing or
  defending any provision hereof.

       14.  Amendments. This Agreement may be modified or amended only in
  writing signed by both Parties which expressly refers to this Agreement and states an
  intention to modify or amend it.  No such amendment or modification shall be
  effected by use of any purchase order, acknowledgment, invoice or other form of
  either Party and in the event of conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any
  such form, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

       15.  Waiver.  A waiver by either Party of a breach of any of the terms of
  this Agreement by the other Party shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent
  breach of the terms of this Agreement.  The failure of any Party to insist upon strict
  performance of any provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right under it
  shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

       16.  Termination.  This Agreement shall expire and shall be of no further
  force or effect Ninety (90) days from the Effective Date unless prior to such time the
  Parties have entered into an act of Cash Sale transferring the Subject Property from
  the Seller to the Buyer.

       Each Party does hereby execute this Agreement as of the ________ day of
  ______, 2001.

Gerald:

    I reviewed the enclosed agreement and made several revisions.  I am
enclosing a redlined version showing my revisions for your convenience.
 My major revisions are summarized as follows:

    1.  I changed all references to "rights of way" or "easement", to
"servitude" or "sevitude of right of use".  Louisiana law does not use
the terms "easement" or "right of way".

    2.  I rearranged the last three clauses in the 1st paragraph for
clarity.

    3.  I combined the content of the 5th paragraph into the 3d paragraph.

    4.  I change the 6th paragraph slightly to strengthen the rights
retained by Grantor.

    5.  I added language to paragraph 7 to give more detail to the
process of abandonment and to strengthen the rights of the Grantor upon
abandonment.

 Please call with any questions or if you need further help with this.
 Thank you for allowing me to provide professional advice on this matter.

Keith

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Armando executed the wrong price confirms and unfortunately, I did not catch it.  We need to send an amendment to change the price for the August 1- October 31 time frame. I will send a copy of the original that he should have exectued.

Thanks 

Stephanie

You are right.  It was our mistake of executing the wrong  agreement.
 
We will take your 2nd alternative:
 
2. Leave the Inside Ferc. reference for July and change  Aug - Oct. to
enable future hedging opportunities. We would need to create  an
amendment for NGI if you want to go this route.
 
Please make the amendment and sent it to me

I noticed that Mexicana and ENA inadvertantly executed the  confirm that
referenced an "Inside FERC" Socal Border Index. I believe that  we had
revised the paperwork to reflect a "Natural Gas Intelligence"  Socal
Border Price since that is the index used for fianancial settlement  in
the basis markets.  
The Inside FERC index is new (started  in March 2001) and reflects an
index of $4.76 for July whereas NGI  published $4.70. Should you elect to
hedge August, Sept and/or October, we  would need to amend the agreement
to reflect the NGI posting.
Here  are our options:
1. Substitue the first page of the confirm (I would  need to send it back
to you for initials) for July - Oct.
2. Leave the  Inside Ferc. reference for July and change Aug - Oct. to
enable future  hedging opportunities. We would need to create an
amendment for NGI if you  want to go this route.
Please call me to discuss at your earliest  convenience - I will be out
of the office this afternoon but back Monday  morning.
Regards,
Stephanie

	Here is my rendition of our To-do Lists:

	Rusk County 
			Provide 1) Short circuit mVa, 2) allowable voltage dip, 3) substation design and 1-line diagram
				4) schedule for power line, 5) schedule for substation 6) transformer sizing, efficiency/loss, etc.

				
	General Electric
			Will provide an all encompassing package from the low side of the transformer to the output shaft of the
			electric motors.  Motors will be delivered to Hanover's shop for packaging and all other components will
			be communicated and delivered to the OGS East Texas location for Hanover to install.

			GE will provide system load study, engineering and design, equipment pricing, and a 10-yr Service &
			Maintenance contract that accommodates all parts, labor, engineering, etc. for all the equipment they
			provided into the project.  These quotes will be provided to ECS and Hanover.

			GE needs the system and design details from Rusk Co. to formalize the package design and pricing
			 
			GE will act as a sub for Hanover who will roll-up the total package of services to ECS.  

			GE will provide a Draft Service & Maintenance Agreement to HCC and ECS.


	Hanover Compression
			HCC will package the skids and provide all the equipment & materials on this skids as well
			as the on-site installation.

			HCC will provide ECS with a detail description of the installation, services and pricing for the project.

			HCC will provide a Maintenance Quote for the compression equipment and materials that HCC provided
			into the project.  (Jim, we probably need a detail description of this so that we can demonstrate how this
			service compliments the OGS resources rather than appearing to be a replacement perception).

			HCC will provide ECS with a project schedule that will become part of the agreement package.

			HCC will provide or perform any torsional studies, equipment testing and start-up resources for the project.
			(Jim, lets discuss to establish an overall schedule that incorporates GE, HCC and Rusk Co.)  My big picture
			look tells me that Rusk Co. will need to begin ordering & sizing transformers next month to ensure a Firm
			in-service date of like 10/01/02.  I want to target a 9/01/02 available for service date and an expectation to have
			electrical service ready and available for Testing and Torsional Analysis work.

			HCC will provide a set of Draft Contracts for the project (Operating Lease & Service and Maintenance Agreements)


	As you guys know, I need everything yesterday.  Obviously all the pricing is critical as well as the Contract language because the 
	agreements with OGS will need to be specific and represent the services that each of you are providing.  Our schedule is critical
	not just for a successful 2nd Quarter close but also to accomplish an 8/02 date for testing and a 9/02 available for service date.  I
	am establishing a FIRM In-Service date of 10/01/02 where all the commodity arrangements will take effect.  I'm expecting that Dave
	Owen and Jimo will be running point with HCC and GE for all the technical and scheduling coordination.  I also need to have the 
	Draft Contracts early next week if not before.  

	Thanks
	mk

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures.
The press dubs the affair "cowgate," but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.

Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using
Letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more. -

Keith,

Patrick Johnson has been out on military leave the past 2 weeks.  I imagine he'll be anxious to get this the transaction with Sorrento finalized once he returns.  Gerald Nemec, a colleague in the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department, has agreed to review the draft Right of Way Agreement and call you to discuss the draft Agreement.  Gerald will be handling all legal work involved with EWS's efforts to sell the 400 acre Napoleonville Salt properties.

He should be contacting you later in the week.

Steve

Mark - 
Attached is Shonnie's proposed language for triggering the termination of the 4t qtr portion of the executory contract.  We would have this amendment executed and send an invoice to ENA for the 4th qtr payment.  Due to the IPAYIT system we would expect payment to likely be slow.  Can you have G-money review it on your side?
Thanks.  
 
Current thought is to bring forward all of 4th qtr payment through the early termination amendment.  Let me know if this causes you concern.  If you get in a jam, we may be able to find some firm capacity on LC or FU to cover you for the rest of the year (or life of pipe).

The purpose of this e-mail is to let you know that we have filed the arbitration demand.  I am out of the office today, but will circulate a copy to everyone tomorrow.
 
Before Texaco files their answer, I want to make sure we take care of the fire eyes and dewatering line issues.  Have those been paid?  Please advise.
 
Also, what is the status on the test to determine appropriate pressure (I forgot the name of it)?  Let me know.  I  think we will probably need to arrange a phone call for early next week with myself, outside counsel, Dave and Garry to walk through some of the technical issues.  Brian and Gerald - let me know if you want to participate.
 
Thanks.
 
Andy

I need to check on their 3rd party debt.  I'll get back to you later today.

However, since the entity is set up as a division of Atmos Energy Corp, do we legally have a master contract with Atmos Energy Corp as well??  Greeley's exposure rolls up under Atmos Energy at the end of the day and they transact under both names.  Also, have we verified that Greeley Gas Company, a division of Atmos Energy Corp is actually a valid legal entity??

Let me know, please.

Thanks--Veronica

Gerald,
I have reviewed these agreements and there is no language that would indicate that Oakhill would be liable for any obligations in the event of their default. Please let me know your thoughts.

Dave Gutierrez with Hanover provided the following response regarding the documents he forwarded to me regarding the GE Capital (Operating Lease).  
I believe that I get the picture,  but it seems that he would have made the changes he has referenced.

Mark,

The agreements you received are to cover the operating lease with the purchase option quoted for this transaction. Hanover will issue the contract whereby Hanover Compression Limited Partnership will be reflected as the Lessor and ECS will be the Lessee. Hanover will then assign the contract to GE whereby all monthly payments will be remitted to GE. Hanover will enter into a separate agreement to cover the maintenance and service portion of this transaction, of which Hanover shall invoice.

The documents forwarded to you are the actual documents you'll be require to execute however they will reflect Hanover as Lessor. Additionally, Hanover maintains all warranty obligations extended against the package regardless of the assignment to GE.

Please review the documents and advise of any exceptions or issues. Keep in mind that these documents are specifically for the monthly operating lease installments and that most of the language is required to comply with the FASB Accounting regs. which keep this transaction as an operating lease/off balance sheet transaction. This is a standard agreement we utilize with other companies seeking operating leases with purchase options while maintaining an off balance sheet transaction.

I'd be glad to visit with you or anyone from your office if necessary to clarify any questions or concerns.



>>> "Knippa, Mark" <Mark.Knippa@ENRON.com> 06/22/01 03:52PM >>>

Not sure I get the picture.  ECS is expecting to have an Operating Lease with Hanover that accommodates the new compressor station (equipment, packaging & installation).  ECS is also expecting to enter into a Maintenance Services Agreement with Hanover that covers the provided equipment and installation, bumper to bumper, for the 10 year term of the agreement.

What has been provided is blank documentation from GE Capital that requires maintenance services, delivery, use & operation, insurance, the return of equipment, etc. that does not fit the parameters of our discussions with Hanover.  Is ECS
expected to execute the agreements with GE Capital or with Hanover?  Is the Hanover Agreement expected to mirror this agreement 	less the services that Hanover is being hired to perform?

	?

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

   hope
   all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch so we

   was great working with you. Write back soon.

The Crescendo project is a Northern Border project, and the appropriate contact for Christopher Sullivan (the fellow that left Jim the voice mail) is probably Janet Place.  I've left Janet a voice mail with the contact information on Sullivan and asked her to get ahold of him regarding his letter on the helium issue.  In case you access email ahead of voice mail Janet, the guy is Chistopher Sullivan, Rocky Mountain Helium, 1-800-945-1547.  Thanks all.  DF

Gerald and Judy,

Shawyne Smith has made the following deals with Unimark LLC   pooled and committed wells ( 1063501, 1033968, and 1063576 ) which include pricing language with 5 separate tiers for maximum volumes of 4275/d.
How should we confirm these deals?  We have language to confirm 2 pricing tiers.  

Judy how should we proceed to confirm these deals?  Should we start this trend of multiple pricing tiers for such small volumes?

Please let me know how we should proceed.

Does it make sense to try to get together to talk about Bridgeline?  I am not sure if you tried to contact Jean but from what I understand, I suspect that she is not willing to help.  Maybe, we gather everyone else that knows anything about the deal, put them all in a room and extract as much info as possible.  Then, we can try to summarize the state of affairs and recommend various courses of action.  Your thoughts.

I spoke to Joe Ball last week and inquired of the status of our permit

recommendation, Joe stated that he had waited long enough and would
finalize the order and permit and submit it to the commissioner for
signature.  he indicated that we should have a signed order sometime
this week.  I'll keep you both posted.

	Gerald, 

	The last time we discussed, you wanted to make some modifications to the CA language
	based on specifics of what we are intentions are with Flowserve.  We probably need to 
	discuss to make sure that your understanding and my perception are in line.

  Gerald;

  ANR's tpa with  ENA, ENA Upstream, Enron MW and enovate does not have the language either.  i.e 3.2b omission.  Charlie at ANR wants the EEs tpas to be identical.
So should I leave it out? Again:  these  companies are all owned by El Paso?

Shane,  As we discussed, we can remove the strike of 3.2(b) in the Tennessee TPAs.  I put in a call to Mojave to discuss this issue with them.  After my conversation with them we can decide how to proceed.  All other TPAs should be sent out with our typical language.

Subject:	tpa - Section 7 issue

    

      Donna Greif has asked me to initiate tpas with about 20 to 22 pipes for the two EES companies.   I am sure that Tennessee and  EPNG will again
      raise the same issue as they did with the language in Section 7 when we initiated tpas for ENA and  ENA Upstream.  
      In order to maintain consistency, should I remove the line referencing the 3.2B omission?

      The tpa between EPNG and ENA does not have this line item.
      The tpa between Tennessee and ENA as well as between Tennessee and ENA Upstream does not have this either.
      
      Mojave also has the same issue with this, they are refusing to sign the tpa with us for ENA.

      These are all EL Paso owned pipes.

      I have already contacted someone at Tennessee, and they want the exact same language as the previous tp agreements.
      

    Thanks


   Shane

I am also working on pulling information out of SAP and assisting with the ECS financial data since Karen is so involved in the monthly close as well as other requests.  I have to agree with Karen.  It is taking some time to search thru the data in SAP since some of the transactions were paid, received, recorded in ENA and we have to search thru the 1000's of transactions in ENA.  Also the files and records have not all been retrieved since essentially no financials have been prepared this year and anyone who worked on ECS in the past are gone.  I am trying to piece all of this together, unfortunately it will take a little time.  I can call Patty and discuss this with her and set her expectations for receiving the financial data as soon as we can pull the finacial data together next week.  I just think it needs to be as comprehensive and accurate as possible before it is sent.

The financial data will not be completed by tomorrow.  As I stated in yesterday's meeting, I would not know how long it would take to prepare everything until I looked at it.  The memo will have to be sent without the financial data.

Attached is my draft of the "two-pager" for LLC.  Obviously it is going to be a bit longer than two pages.

Please take a look and provide any comments that you might have.

Also:

1)  Gerald please provide summaries of the debtor contracts as you did for NNG and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo;
2)  Karen - please continue your efforts (in cooperation with Mark) to provide the revenues/expenses both actual and forecasted to be attached to the memo;
3)  Mark - please provide the deal structure diagrams for the deals (obviously you already gave me Gallup - but please forward to me electronically) and also respond to the issues that have your name by them in the memo.

I really would like to have this memo completed by mid-day tomorrow so that I can get it to Patty M as promised.  Thanks in advance for your efforts.

Regards

Stuart

Gerald,

Where are we in the process of gathering e-mails and other discovery that may be responsive to WFLA's request? Also, can I tell John Haswell that our contract with Gulf does contain a confidentiality clause? We discussed this but I can't remember if we agreed that I could disclose it.

Bill

check out the following websites for airfare:

www.orbitz.com - the best so far.  
www.cheaptickets.com
www.hotwire.com - with this one, you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer

register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform

Then of course, there is expedia and travelocity - but they tend to be more expensive.  Also, sometimes when you check the same website again 5 minutes later, it will show a better price.  Don't forget - tomarrow is 7 days in advance (that might matter)

p.s.  If you want to see how UN attractive my friends are - we are going to be a the wine bucket (new place - W. Alabama just east of Kirby) at 6 pm tonight.  Suzanne, Camille, Jeanie, Lori, Elizabeth.  You can check Camille out for yourself.  Bring others along.

Barbara per our discussion, I am attaching a list of the Houston Pipeline Bonds of which this  list was furnished in September, 2000.  

 
The list furnished to Gerald Nemec are bonds that are open bonds.

 

Since Houston Pipeline Company was sold and they have appointed Marsh USA the agent of record effective 06-01-01.  These bonds should be moved to the new agent and the surety, St. Paul Fire and Marine.  Please let me know how to proceed.  

Thanks.

Gerald, we recently placed a $50,000 bond for HPL for Franchise Tax Certification for you.  

I understand from our broker, John L. Wortham that our surety, St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine was informed that Marsh USA will be handling the HPL bonds effective 06-01-01 (please see attached email).

I am attaching a list of outstanding bonds that HPL has in place.   Should these bonds be canceled? Or if these bonds are still required, you may wish to consider placing with your new agent of record, Marsh USA.  They can either be replaced all at once or just prior to expiration. 

Please note while most of the bonds were placed with St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine there are a couple that were placed with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.   

Please let me know how you wish to handle the outstanding bonds.. Thanks.  

If you have questions, please give me a call 713 853-5687.

Mary, we have received information from Roger Bumgarner at St. Paul/Seaboard that Marsh USA has been appointed agent of record effective June 1, 2001 on the HPL bonds he writes.

As you know, there are three bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two through Insurance Company of North America.  I presume we will  be receiving notice that Marsh has been appointed on them, also.   However, we have not yet received information to that effect.

Gerald,

See the attached schedule for Docket 010441, the Gulf/WFEC dispute.

There is no schedule yet for the Gulf rate hearing. We expect that in early
October and I will forward it to you.

You asked about the effect of intervention in the rate case on the
territorial dispute. In addressing this question it is useful to know that
the FPSC rate hearing intervention rules are very liberal        (Enron can
intervene at any time) and that the rate case will not proceed rapidly. For
procedural purposes, a prompt intervention decision is not necessary.

Also, I think that Gulf has the stronger position in the territorial
dispute. Because an Enron intervention in the rate case could confuse the
staff and raise questions from WFEC, I think it best from ECS's perspective
to await a decision in the territorial dispute before petitioning for
intervention.



I've reviewed the questions in Harry Kingerski's e-mail that you forwarded.
Preliminarily, I note two corrections. First, we expect a decision in the
territorial dispute in early December, not November. Second, Harry said
that;

      "Gulf proposed surcharge treatment for the capital costs of Smith
earlier this year, but eventually withdrew the application because the PPA
it was trying to get in place, whereby Southern would take ownership of the
plant and sell energy and capacity back to Gulf, drew a lot of flack".

I don't know if it matters, but Susan Clark was told that Gulf withdrew the
application because the discovery order in the docket would have required
the release of Southern Company strategic planning material that Southern
considered very confidential. Withdrawal was preferable to disclosure. (I
recognize that this may be only Gulf's "spin" on the withdrawal and they may
have withdrawn for exactly the reason Harry suggests.)

The strategic questions posed in Harry's e-mail are complex and involve more
than one Enron entity. His questions defy a prompt response, at least from
us. We suggest that it would be useful to convene a meeting in Houston,
including us and a representative from each wholly-owned and potentially
affected Enron entity. That would facilitate the development and
handicapping of a regulatory stance that is best for Enron. Susan's
experience as a Florida Commissioner for nine years (and General Counsel for
years before that) is useful in understanding the factors that inform
staff's recommendations as well as a Commissioner's decisions in this
context. (I've attached Susan's information.)

Let me know what you would like us to do.

Bill

Hey Gerald!

I finally got my computer back up.  The name of the utility is Powder River Energy Corporation - A Touchstone Energy Cooperative (I don't know if you need that last part or not).  The relationship is this:

ECS is acting as the agent on behalf of Crestone Energy Ventures, LLC to purchase power and deliver shaft horsepower.  We will be buying electricity strictly off of PRECORP's tariff.  We will also be providing the cash for PRE to build transmission to the compressor site.  Right now, the deal term is for 10 years, starting in May '02, but we will begin negotiations with them immediately.  

Last week I met with three people from PRECORP, just to begin the relationship, one of which was Clarence Moshier (Chief Operating Officer for PRECORP), who I spoke to again yesterday.  He said that they would have no problem signing a CA with us.  Basically, I just want to make sure that whatever we put in place with PRECORP cannot be relayed to Crestone by them.

Anything else you need?

Andrew

Ellen,

Based on some additional information from Linder regarding their Pre-pay deal, the confirmations for the August confirmations as well as any confirmations that we prepare through the end of the Pre-payment deal that runs through October will need to be GTC Firm confirmations with modified MDQ language.  Please get with Gerald Nemec if you have questions regarding how to prepare the MDQ language. 

Also, please prepare these confirmations as soon as possible. The pre-pay paperwork must go out to the customer by August 10th; and Stacy Dickson needs the confirmations in order to complete the pre-pay contract.

Thanks,
Judy

Yea, someone should have warned you about the drinks being poured at the
ol' GK.  They tend to be pretty stiff.

...and ..."Swerve on?"  I have only a select group of friends who use such
terminology - you must be one of those cool-guy types!

A night out on Thursday sounds really good right now - maybe I will see
you.  Downing Street is one of my favorite low-key spots - a bit of a meat
market at times, but low key nonetheless.  Not to be rude, but to be
thorough rather, would you describe yourself as blond or more of a
brunette?

Yea, we definitely had our swerve on that night.  I will have to have a
talk with that bartender next time, because I was over-served.  Probably
not a good idea to start at GK at 6  and stay til 2 in the morning.

Thanks for your gracious response.  Let me tell you, I had much debate over
whether email was the appropriate communication medium or the phone.  I was
swung in favor of email to save myself the potential awkwardness of the
following phone conversation scenario:

     Jennifer:  "Hello"
     Gerald:  "Hi, Jennifer, this is Gerald.  We met at the Gallant Knight
on Friday"
     Jennifer:  "Who?"

As I said Friday night was kind of hazy for me.  I'll probably be meeting
some friends for happy hour on Thursday night at Downing Street.  If you
and your friends are out, why don't you try and stop by.

Gerald.

   I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.  No

   Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant Knight
   on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had
   never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition of
   "Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"
   We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very charming.
   I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or a
   drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or involved
   with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

   P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him.

Sandi,

I am told that you were the person responsible for drafting the confirmations for the Producer One finder's fee and that you will no longer be performing this function. I am trying to find out who in legal will be responsible for drafting these in the future.  As far as my records show, we have sent a confirmation to Alcorn, and we still need to prepare a confirmation for the Dale Resources deal.

Do you have the records that identify what deals that have been confirmed for Finder's fees?  Do you know who will be taking over this function?

I appreciate any help that you can provide.

deathbed I would have toughed it out.  I listened to you guys message as it
came in, I know it you be you guys harassing me.  Laura heard it the next
day and asked "you don't think JT was really over there......do you?"

Anyway, I guess I owe somebody 16 bucks.   I also need to get your house
key back to you.  Has any mail or magazines of mine randomly shown up at
your place, lately?

OUT!

Dear Gerald:  I called Judy Thorn, ENA Upstream staff.  She said that as far as tax matters went, she wasn't sure who set up the structure for the company.  She said, however, that she'd had dealings with Chris Bystriansky in the tax department about the severance taxes.  He shows up as a senior tax analyst at ext. 53040.  Is he the person who called you? If not, maybe he'll have the answer your tax contact requested.   --MCO

Greetings Paul:
 
Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal. 
 
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
 
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
 
Please advise ASAP.
 
Ragards,
 
Stephanie

Cheryl,

Please do not suspend this CP until my group can review the current contracts in place and any deals that may have been covered by those contracts.  Bridgette Anderson will be looking at this once trading slows tomorrow.  We'll discuss it and get back with you tomorrow afternoon.

Has anyone in Legal heard anything on this?  

Thanks,

Hi Stacey,

Got a request from Darren in Credit, to change the status of the subject CP to non-trading.  When I made the change, I got the edit that indicates that 8 contracts are still active on the record, and the maintenance group is HOUGAS.  Per Darren, all trades should be under CP ID 55134, i/no/ Constellation Power Source, Inc.  I just want to make sure those can be moved if the record is in a non-trading status.

This is also flagged for EES, should that link and retail flag be added to the Constellation Power Source record, even though it is not known to be one of EES's customers at this time, or at least it hasn't been flagged as such at this time?  I also went in to make that change, but since you are working on those contracts, I wanted to run it by you first.

Gerald & Stacy,

I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.

ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.

I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Here is the CA for acquisition discussions.  The only change from our other agreement is in the description of "confidential information."  See what you think.

Russell, pls set up credit terms for customer for transactions under the physical, which may include pricing amemdments. i.e. the MTM risk may sit under the physical agreement.  

At this time, we are not going to pursue the execution of a deemed ISDA and any price amendments will be handled physicaly. 

Call if there are any questions.

Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!
__________________________________
To download the software:
1)  Visit the ClickAtHome Portal at www.clickathome.net from your ClickAtHome PC.
2)  Logon to the Portal with your personally created Portal User ID and Password, or create a new account if you have not created a user ID and password by selecting "Create a NEW Account" at the top left corner.  The Portal User IDs and Passwords are created by you.  The Enron Help Desk is not able to assist with Portal support, but if you need any assistance, please send an email to "clickathome@enron.com".
3) Once you have logged on, select "Tools" from the top menu bar.
4) Under the "Secure Download" heading, click on "BlackICE" or "Norton" and log on to the download page using your SAP ID and Date of Birth.

These amounts will be netted with ENA left paying a total of $778,558.
On Oct. 1 ENA will pay $669,600.  (this is the normal wire payment for executory contract ---  $21,600 per day for 31 days)
On Nov. 1 ENA will pay 108,958 which is the balance.

These payment due not include any dollars owed due to the outstanding June and July Westport revenue payment estimated at $109,000.  Its just a coincident.    

Also, we would like to add a short statement which indicates ENA continued agreement in providing backup documentation on some the expenditures NBP has agreed to pay.  
Thanks.

Subject: Gulf Rate Docket - Weather Derivatives




MR,

With information about Harry's testimony in Georgia and about the existing
Gulf revenue sharing program, I've changed my opinion about whether Enron
should intervene in the Gulf docket.  Enron may benefit from intervening in
the Gulf rate docket both by selling the Florida Commission on its weather
derivatives and by dissuading the Commission from raising the retail rates
charged to ECS/EES.

The Commission's order in the territorial dispute is due December 3.  To
avoid any adverse inferences in that docket as a result of intervening in
the Gulf rate docket, we should not file the intervention until after that
time.

There is a preliminary issue identification meeting in the Gulf rate docket
on Nov. 7, but this may be moved because a meeting in the RTO docket has
just been scheduled for the same time. We will attend both meetings.

Enron likely has standing to intervene in this docket.  Both the Florida
Cable Telecommunications Association and the Florida Industrial Power Users
Group (which has no significant member in Gulf's territory) have been
granted standing to intervene on the simple grounds that they are retail
customers of Gulf and electricity represents one of their largest variable
costs.  Gulf has not objected to the petitions of any persons seeking
standing.  The Federal Executive Agencies also have standing to represent
four military bases in Gulf's territory.

The existing and soon expiring revenue sharing mechanism makes this docket
ripe for pitching weather derivatives.  If we petition (after Dec. 3) and
are granted standing to intervene, it will be necessary to prepare and file
Harry's direct testimony and exhibits by December 21. The schedule of
remaining activities in the Docket is:

  issue statements due:  Jan. 2
  second issue identification meeting:  Jan. 14
  Prehearing statements:  Jan. 24
  Prehearing conference:  Feb. 8
  Hearing:  Feb. 25 - Mar. 1
  Briefs:  March 15

Natalie spoke to the Rates and Tariffs Division at the PSC about the usage
characteristics of the military bases.  As we discussed, I was curious about
whether they were also designated PX (Large High Load Factor Power Service).
Because a customer's designation is Gulf's proprietary (and very guarded)
information, one cannot know for sure whether the military bases have the
same designation as ECS.  However, Dave Wheeler, asst. director of rates,
said the military bases are probably designated LP (large power service) and
not PX.  PX designation applies for customers whose demand is 7.5 MW (7,500
kw), with an annual load factor of at least 75%, at any one meter.  The
military bases take delivery at multiple delivery points and probably have
different rates at the different delivery points.  They likely do not take
more than 7.5 MW at any one point.

The LP or LPT (large power time sensitive) designation is more likely
because that applies to customers with a demand of 500 kw, which the
military bases probably have at various delivery points. Still, it is very
likely that the rate increase, as proposed, does not affect the federal
executive agencies.

Dave Wheeler also guaranteed that Gulf's current rate proposal (that leaves
the PX rate unchanged) will not be approved by the Commission.  He said that
they will not permit a rate increase that affects only small customers. Bad
politics.

The level of effort required for this intervention will be greater than the
RTO Docket. There we had only to endorse positions asserted by others.
Although here we will merely be endorsing Gulf's rate methodology, we will
also be introducing the weather derivatives concept as relevant to Gulf's
rates. Gulf may be so excited by the potential of weather derivatives that
they carry the burden by themselves. However, we can't count on that until
we are sure that they understand and can sell the product to the Commission
and staff. Therefore, the Enron budget for this intervention will have to
assume that Enron carries the burden. We will be expected to advocate and
participate fully.

Based on these assumptions I think it likely that the KKH fee expense for
full participation in this Docket will be about twice that in the RTO
matter. In the RTO Docket we billed Enron $27,204 through October (after
writing-off $4,207 at your request). Therefore, a planning number for this
Docket (no guarantee that it will be limited to this amount) is $50,000.

Let me know what you decide.

Bill

Rudwell,  Attached is a redline of the guaranty with my comments.  Specifically they are:

	1.  I am OK with including reasonable attorney fees, but they must be included in the $2.5 million dollar cap.  
	2.  The use of subtantially in Paragraph 2 seems redundant.  The notice requires reasonable detail.  To add subtantial compliance on top of that is redundant.
	
I am OK with the other changes.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Yes, ENA Upstream Company LLC is the entity that deals with ENA's transactions with producers, similar to the way HPL (Houston Pipe Line Company) was dealing with producers.  

As for Fred Lagrasta, I've already created a document (copy attached) asking for Lagrasta to be named a V.P.  I don't know where it is in the signing cues of the relevant officers, but it may need to be changed since the directors have changed since I created the doc.  Have you by any chance seen this signed document?  I sent it to the 33rd floor to be signed, and I haven't had it returned.   

Please advise, and thanks,
Best wishes,
Mary

Lou/Gerald

My understanding is that Bridgeline is a pipeline joint venture in which we own a 40% equity interest (but share control 50/50).  The other owner is Texaco.  Earlier in the year, we were looking at trying to sell our interest but there is a ROFR in the Contribution Agreement which restricts our ability to do this.  I believe that the ROFR expires in March or April of next year and am curious to know what impact ENA's bankruptcy may have on this ROFR.  In other words, will the bankruptcy filing have the effect of invalidating the ROFR?  The answer may depend on the actual owners of Enron's equity interest.

Gerald - would you please provide any information about Bridgeline that may be helpful in answering these questions and also confirm the information provided above.  While this is not a fire that needs to be put out immediately, there are a number of issues relating to Bridgeline that should be dealt with simultaneously (and some of those other issues do require more immediate attention).  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Stuart

G,

July is good. I am taking the first two weeks off in July so sometime during
that time would be good. We need to go tubing or something.

No George Jr. for a while. We know better than to be in hurry. Actually I
plan on being the father and grandfather of our kids. No incest, I just
going to be old enought to handle both duties. I figure it would save money.


Good to here your taking your time with Barbara. She needs to understand,
you're not in a hurry for a good reason. You know how women are, tick
tock,tick tock. Damn the clock pisses me off.

Did you go to China on purpose or did you miss a connection?

Sounds cool. We thought we had historic crap.

Let's get together dude.

GT,  Hey guy I am doing good.  The casa made it through the floods with no
problem.  I was actually out of the country when all that occurred.  I just
got back from two weeks in China.  Very interesting.  Saw the Great Wall
and a whole lot of other things.  I am still seeing Barbara, the girl I
took to your wedding.  Things are going okay with that.  I am not very good
at the relationship thing right now and she gets frustrated with me.

How's the married life.  Thought there might be a George Jr. on the way by
now.

Yes,  I need to make a trip to Austin soon.  The next couple of weekends
are swamped, but maybe sometime in mid to late July.  What does your
Calender look like then?

   the

Jack/Robyn:

These have been signed on our end and we can present them at the Wednesday board meeting.  It would be good if you and Jack can stay after we finish our business to discuss transitioning the Bridgeline employees from the parents to the holding company.  I would also like to discuss how we can resolve the Texaco/Bridgeline and Enron/Bridgeline open issues without undue pain and suffering.

Regards,
Brian

Brian & Jean,

In trying to move the BH 2001 Comp Plan along, Jack and I have signed the
attached docs and you will be receiving the original for your signature in
the mail.  Brian and Jeanie, I have changed the resolutions slightly from
what I sent over to you on 7/12.  These docs are designed around the
Compensation Committee idea where the Compensation Committee signs the Plan,
not Randy.

Let me know if you have any questions or are not in agreement.  Please send
a copy of the original to me once you have signed.

Gerald,

There is a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, Sept 25 at 9 am to discuss, among other things, the hazardous waste issues at Assumption Parish with Kyle Purvis and David Owen.  Would you be able to make to the meeting for about 10-15 minutes to discuss this issue? 

Any changes on the chain of title issue for the Assumption Parish deal?

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

OK, I gave up.  I've been in meetings all day anyhow, so I just stuck the copies in interoffice mail.

Stacy,  Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.  I will do so.  Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.  Thanks.

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

 << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Attached please find the UPDATED responsibilities for the Global Contracts and Global Facilities teams.  Due to restructuring within our group, we have lost three team members (Anthony Campos, Cyndie Balfour-Flanagan, and Ryan Sheeren) to the physical gas confirmation group.  Our team members' individual responsibilities have changed as a result.

Please forward the attached information to your staff and coworkers.  Please call me at x30569 if you should have any questions.

Thanks,
Stacey

Stephanie:  scott never called back yesterday, after repeated calls.  I called him a few minutes ago, and he wanted his lawyers to talk to Gerald, before they make a deal.  So at least the ball is starting to roll.  Will let you know what happens.  Thanks

Gerald,

Further to your voice mail, let's put it together as is with the legal language covering oral discussions.  As for the Energy Transfer Group CA, I forgot what I requested as I verbally got it from Mike and then told it to you and did not write it down.  Let me know if you have the info, otherwise I'll call Mike back and discuss.

Thanks,

Two things;  1. The modification excludes all oral information.  So any confidential information that you guys orally give them is not protected. 2.  It might be a headache for you guys to remember to mark everything as confidential.  If you forget, it is not protected.  I think the changes should come out.

Chris,
The CA looks okay.  I made one change in para 4 that requires Enron to identify and mark the confidential information sent to Ormat.  I presume that not ALL correspondence between us will have to do with structured horsepower transactions.

See attached.

Stacy: 
I hope all is well on the home front.  The more astute among us have spotted the following items in the agreements that should be changed: 
  
NGSA 
            Section 3.4 (ii) - - change "counterparty contract"  to "counterparty contact" 
            Section 9.1 - - change "...or should have know..."  to "...or should have known..." 
            Section 13.1 - - There was also some discussion about the prohibition against issuing "any... statement with respect to the existence of this Agreement..." being overly broad.  Because Palo Alto is a public agency, open meeting laws may result in referencing this agreement, although not necessarily disclosing the business terms.  I think this concern would be addressed by adding the language I proposed in the email I sent you yesterday. 
Transaction Agmt. 
            The end date of the "Delivery Period" described on page two should be December 31, 2002, rather than June 30, 2004, to coincide with the term of the NGSA. 
It would help matters immensely if we could get a "final" version of both agreements from you by noon (Houston time) on Monday.  If there are any problems, please let me know right away.  Thanks.

In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

Info on Aruba:

Go to www.funjet.com
click on Carribean, then aruba.  It will list all of the hotels.  We are staying at the Allegro Resort Aruba - All Inclusive.  If you click on it, you  can find out about the hotel.
To price, click on reservations at the top, answer all of the questions.  Departure date is 10/17/01, flying on American,  and we are staying 4 nights.  Click 'check availability'.  Then you will have to pick your flights and hotel.  We got the insurance so we can cancel at the last minute - in the case of weather or whatever!  It will price it up for you but you can't book online.

I went through Dee (x1176) at Travel agency in the park.  They seem to get a better price than you are quoted online.

Gerald, don't be scared!  I should have eaten dinner last night!  Elizabeth had fun and that guy got her number!  Another high five to me for playing cupid!! Ha!

Let me know if you guys have any questions! 

K.

Gerald,

Can you get with Debra on this contract I don't know why she is still jacking with this.  How's everything else going?  Oh, I called Darrin on those credit figures that will be needed for that amendment to the Kennedy Oil contract, has he called you?

Are you familiar with the Dow Chemical Storage contracts with LRCI?  I am trying to determine what we should be billed from Dow and what we should pass through to Bridgeline.  Any assistance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.

Gentlemen,

What's happening with the above deal ? The term is 11/01/01 - 03/31/02, I can see the volume has been changed to 0 - is this only temporarily or has this deal been killed ?
We show this deal as Pending and I wanted to remind you that we have never confirmed this transaction. Please advise.

Regards,
Ellen

Mike McConnell and Enron Community Relations is challenging Corp, EES, EGS (which includes ETS and Global Assets), and EWS to win the Race to Cure Diabetes.  

Which business unit  will sell the most shoes?

To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain or contact Janice Riedel at x37507.  The donation will represent a $10 contribution (with the company match) toward the research foundation.  Your shoe will be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26th.  Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Researchers are closing in on finding a cure.

The Cure for Juvenile Diabetes is within walking distance.

Attached is a cash use approval request for the cash distributon for 4th quarter to the investing partner of ECS, LLC.  Please review the form as soon as possible as I would like to get this on the five day rollforward list in the morning.  Payment is due on 12/28/01 as our investing partner EMP ECHO has an obligation to pay their creditor on 01/02/02.  Patty Melcher, representative of EMP ECHO, called today requesting a status update on outstanding issues relating to ECS, LLC including this distribution.

Funding for this distribution is to be made out of the ECS LLC's bank account which has sufficient funds to make this distribution as well as the outstanding electricity invoices.  Karen Gruesen will send a follow up e-mail confirming the balance in the bank accounts.

Karen and I are continuing to work on the financial statements and as discussed with Patty will be forwarded as soon as completed for the first three quarters of 2001 which had previously not been completed.

Another comment...on the Cross Media contract, you need to add Esenjay on the signature page. Also, sometimes on the exhibits, you list Helmerich & Payne as "H&P" or "Helmerich"...you may want to make consistent. Thanks

Gerald, a couple of comments...
1) Pricing does not change until 1/102, nor do other provisions like the keep whole, The way you have the contracts drafted, it is as if we have new terms beginning now. I think the producers will object to this and think we are trying to put something over on them now. Can we make the new contracts effective 1/1/02?

2) Under Art. 2 Contract price....I have a questions about the 80% of "First of the Month Nomination"...what about the 5% swing they get...Shouldn't it be 80% of actuals, subject to the keep whole? Maybe I am the one confused, but could you please call me to discuss. Thanks.

FYI - 
I just wanted to update everyone on this Master Service Agreement "Demand Payment".  ENA has bought out of this agreement effective today.  Lisa Koersellman has made final payment to Crestone and I have taken the Demand Fee to zero in Sitara  (Deal #498560) for the remainder of the term.

Anne Bike is handling any entries that need to be made in tag.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,
Theresa

Subject:	ENA Payment Schedule


The payment schedule for the net settlement of the PPA Closing Statement and the Executory Contract Termination is different than I communicated to you earlier.

The payment received yesterday from ENA was for September service and was in the amount of $648,000.  I was wrong on the billing mechanics in the exec contract.  Thus, I need ENA to wire $669,600 as soon as possible.  The balance would still be due on Nov. 1.  I just spoke with someone in ENA treasury regarding this payment but at the time I thought yesterday's wire was sufficient.  She was requesting wiring instructions which are below.  I did not get her name.  Can you forward this on to the appropriate treasury person and let me know when they will issue this wire?

Sorry for the confusion.
Thanks.


The wiring instructions are

Bank Acct Name is Crestone Energy Ventures
Bank ACCT #30479083
Bank Name - Citibank
Bank Address - NYNY
Routing Code - ABA#021000089

The Perfect Couple

Once upon a time, a perfect man and a perfect woman met. After a perfect
courtship, they had a perfect wedding. Their life together was, of course,
perfect.

One snowy, stormy Christmas Eve, this perfect couple was driving their
perfect car (a Grand Caravan) along a winding road, when they noticed
someone at the side of the road in distress. Being the perfect couple, they
stopped to help.

There stood Santa Claus with a huge bundle of toys. Not wanting to
disappoint any children on the eve of Christmas, the perfect couple loaded
Santa and his toys into their vehicle. Soon they were driving along
delivering toys.

Unfortunately, the driving conditions deteriorated and the perfect couple
and Santa Claus had an accident. Only one of them survived the accident.

The mind numbing question is: Who was the survivor?

Scroll down for the answer...

The perfect woman survived. She's the only one who really existed in the
first place. Everyone knows there is no Santa Claus and there is no such
thing as a perfect man. Women stop reading here. That is the end of the
joke.

Men keep'a scrollin'...

So, if there is no perfect man and no Santa Claus, the perfect woman must
have been driving. And that explains why there was a car accident. By the
way, if you're a woman and you're reading this, this illustrates another
point: Women never listen, either

Gerald:

I am attaching the following documents for your review:

1).  Purchase and  Sale Agreement,

2)  Draft of the body of a letter from LRCI to the Police Jury

I have revised the Purchase and Sale Agreement to add the language to
the suggested by Kim Torres (in ? 4) and to add Louisiana Resources,
Inc. and Louisiana Resources, L.P. as intervenors in the Cash Sale to
quitclaim the property to the Police Jury to solve the title problem.

Please contact me upon receipt to discuss and to fill in the blanks.

Keith

hall have the right to apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for such =
equitable relief as is necessary to preserve and enforce their rights under=

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Just a quick note to let you all know that my time with EWS has been one of the most rewarding jobs I have had, not merely because it was my first position in the legal profession, but also because of the quality of people that I was fortunate enough to have worked with.

Thank you for the wonderful send off on Friday!

Best wishes,
Sam

Cyndie,

We get these requests from time to time, so it is not all that uncommon.  We are currently taking this on a CP-by-CP basis and not making any assumptions yet.   Gerald has already agreed that while the default payment date on the GTC states the end of the month, we CAN change the due date to the 25th with the CP's agreement.  Southwestern Energy Services is the CP we have changed already.  You might want to coordinate future changes with Lisa, Mary, Sharon/Susan.   And of course, please keep us all in the loop on any new CP's you need to have changed.

Thanks,
SBR

Subject:	Unimark: Faxed comments concerning pymt due date

Per a 11/15/01 fax notice, Unimark wishes the payment dates be "Payment by wire on the 25th Day". Referenced deals: 1061122; 1062624; 1063968; 1061089; 1063576; 1146397; 1064010; & 1061084. 

Okay, new kid on the block here:

I'd assume that it is a safe assessment that Unimark would prefer all future payments to be made on the 25th via wire. Lisa, is this something you'd confirm with Unimark (contact per fax is Cheryl Hartsell, phone#: 405-844-6200 ext. 228) or is this something I can do?

Mary, given where we are in the month I know that the payment details have already been established & that given the date that it is too late to process Oct production for payment today.

Stacey/Sharon: Please adjust the payment detail in Global so that the terms flow downstream to Unify for next month's production.

Also; Lisa, Mary, Stacey & Sharon - - - - how common are the requests for payment date adjustments? I'd assume (former life experience) that the larger producers or those who process royalty or related payments require payment on the 25th due to their responsiblities. If this is common - - - instead of repairing after the fact - - - - do we have a list of customers that we should automatically adjust the payment terms within Global & likewise to that of the GTC template?

Gerald - - - - Hi! I'm over here in Confirms now. What is your input on this issue or to that of the common occurrence? Also, as the 'new kid' - - - - are their any future protocols I should know of???


Thanks all!!!!

Lets meet from 4:00 to 4:45 on the 5th floor of ECS.  As it stands now - we need to understand what happens under the agreements in the event that we pull LRCI into bankruptcy.

Case 1:  Do Nothing - Dow terminates lease and brine service agreement, traps gas in storage, LRCI cannot complete Enron #1, LRCI pays penalty payments to Bridgeline for not making storage capacity available, LRCI defaults under Contribution Agreement.  

Case 2: LRCI in Bankruptcy - ? 

We need to make a call.

Regards,
Brian

Probably need to include Jim Coffey on this, as his group will ultimately be responsible for the accounting for the Bridgeline investment.  I am available at 4 pm but will need to leave at 5.  Let me know if we will be able to get a meeting together today.

Gerald,
FYI - The paragraph on Firm Transportation Backhaul was revised, to include secondary rights and tiered pricing, and the Interruptible Transportation Forwardhaul was deleted.  Exhibit II was revised and Exhibit III was deleted as well.

Gerald, 

I met with Roger Westbrook on Friday about the Bridgeline easements.  We figured out what info we already have and what we still need.  Attached is an email from Roger to Joel Milliet from Bridgeline regarding what we still need.  

I am working with Roger on putting together the ROW agreement.  I will send it to you for review once we were are done.  Roger is out of town this week so you can probably expect something from us by the middle of next week.  In the meantime, could you please put together the special warranty deed for the sale of the 2.82 acres to Bridgeline?  The price agreed on is $6500/acre. 

Talk to you soon,

Rakhi

I am out on Monday, but can be reached at 713.826.4488 (cell). I thought everything looked good. FYI - Karen cannot find an accrued liability balance at 6/30/01 after all.  I want to make sure that this is a final adjustment, not subject to further audit whereby we would have to give it back. Exposure is the 100k we deducted from the Hanover realted amouints. But I don't want Northern to know - it seems to me they have already accepted it and we used the 100k to feel better about the issue we felt was in our favor contractually anyway.

Gerald-
I had an error in the Adjusted Purchase price calc.  Instead of $4,000,705, it should be $4,705,000.  Thus, the adjusted purchase price should be $209,863,642.  The error correction is in ENA's favor.
With that change, NBP is good with the document.
Thanks

Gerald,

We are in discussion with Public Service Company of Colorado about acquiring
a small gathering system just north of the Badger Wash Gas Plant.  The
attached document gives a little background of the transaction and lists
some of my questions concerning this transaction.  After you review the
document, I would like to discuss these issues with you to be sure we have

You're right, we need to do better at keeping in touch.  Gerald and I live in
the same town, and we still hardly see each other!  Great to hear from you.

I know it's got to be the hardest thing to leave for six months, especially with
the new baby when mama needs you the most.  Do you guys have any family in town
at least?  You're wife is probably involved with a network of military wifes at
least.  It's hard for me to leave for even a couple of days.  The week after
next I am in Dallas for a week of training, that'll be the longest I've been
away.

Well, my wife just went to the movies with my oldest, Sophie (she's four).  I'm
home with my two boys who are both napping, so I actually have a minute to
write.  I am about to make lunch for my neighbor who is from South Africa.  His
family just left for SA for two months, so I'll probably have him over often.
We're about to cook some Elgin sausage, remmeber where that is Paul?  I was in
Austin for work on Friday (drove there) and stopped to get some.  The road trip
was quite eventful: saw a few wreck and one car was even on fire.

You probably don't catch national weather Paul, but we just had a
once-in-a-century storm here in Houston (that's what they're calling it on the
news anyway).  Some places in the Houston area had 35" of rain in the last two
days!  We had about 20" in my area, no flooding though.  Gerald, how did you
fare?  So we've been declares a natural disaster area and all of that.


Other than that, not a whole lot going on.  Work is going well:  I got promoted
in Feb and am in line for another in August, so I can't complain - Frito-Lay is
a good stable company that treats it's employees well.  Let's see what else?
just got a new car that I am excited about.  I had a little Ford Focus 5spd for
my comuter car, but got tired of all of the shifting in traffic on the Beltway.
So I found a 1999 Buick Regal GSE with only 22k on it, in immaculate shape.  I
know, a Buick sounds kinda lame, but as far as Buicks go, this the only one I
would own.  It has leather, sunrfoor, sporty wheels, killer 220-watt stereo,
with a 240HP supercharged engine with room for 5 to boot!  I loaded up the
family and cargo to go to the Valley during Memorial Day, it even got 28 MPG!
Beats the hell out of the 14 or so in the Suburban, with gas prices these days.
Gerald, are you still in the market for a SUV?   I think you were interested in
the Toyota Sequoia or the Acura MDX?  You'd better just stick with the 5-series
Bimmer, I know I would if I were in your shoes!

OK, guys, gotta get to cookin those sausages.  Bieraugel, hang in the there out
at sea and keep us proud!

Ern

Ernie and Gerald, well dudes, we're doing just what we said we were not
going to do.  Fall out of touch again.  Here is the latest.  I am out on my
ship for six months now.  We left June 4th and we get back in November.
It's a bitch to be gone from the family for that long but it very busy so it
goes fast for me.  We had our fourth (and probably last) kid on May 13th.
Her name is Chloe Elizabeth.  She is perfect.  My two year old (Kate) was
very surprised when we brought her home.  Carson said he wanted a brother
and Kelly wants to hold her all the time.  You can check some pictures out
at www.geocities.com/pbieraugel.  Take it easy you guys and stay in touch.

What's new dude. I haven't heard from you so I thought I'd bug ya. How's the

something.

Hope you're doing well

I am working with Gerald and Debra on implementing a GISB with Tenn. Gas. Currently, we have worked out every detail. Their legal department is reviewing our special provisions and then they are supposed to sign two copies of the agreement and send them to us for final execution.

Gerald,

There are a number of things that have come up on which I hope to get your assistance, concerning both Dow wells 13 and 14 and the land sale to Texas Brine.

Starting with Dow, I have written a (very rough!) draft reply to Gary Chapman's letter of October 2 regarding a new amendment to the Brine Services Agreement.  
We still would like them to buy the pad gas, but, given the equipment purchases needed if we do have to remove the pad gas, we have to have a concrete deadline for whether they will buy the gas (Dec. 14).  Even so, in talking to Dave Owen it seems to me that the equipment may not be installed for rebrining by the time we exit the wells.  How do we handle that type of delay contractually?  
Dave Owen has told Dow that we are not interested in allowing the fresh water option that Dow suggested in their letter, so I did not even address it here.  I think they understand that we want no part of that. 
Perhaps we can discuss these and other issues after you've read the draft.  

 
As for the Texas Brine land sale, 
Jean has asked me to draw up a timeline to close.  I have spoken to the Texas Brine folks, and unless something goes really wrong with their environmental analysis,  we all expect this to close by the end of November.  The timeline reflects this, but I would like you to take a quick look and see if I am missing anything, as there really are not that many steps.  
TB has not gotten back to us on the draft sale document, but I'm hoping to get it soon.   
There has been a bit of delay as they have requested access to any environmental assessments we have done on the land.  All the channels I have pursued tell me there has never been anything done by Enron (per Kyle Purvis).  If you know anything about this, please let me know!
Do you have a draft of the easement agreement (?) for the March land sale?  I don't have alot of details about location etc, but I think I could find them out if necessary.  Perhaps while we are waiting for a reply on the sale doc we can hammer out the language for the easements on that and on the new land sale.

 
I think that's it for now, have a great weekend and please let me know if you have time to talk early next week.  Thanks!  Eva

The agreement looks good from our angle - send it and lets see what Dow thinks.

UPDATE: 

I received a call from Gulf South who says that they have completed their deal with Dow to lease caverns #13 and #14, subject to receiving FERC permits.  So, Dow should be willing to let us extend the lease because they will be giving up significant value if we start withdrawing gas.  Gulf South can't buy the gas from us now, because they do not have the proper FERC permits.  We may, however, be able get them to pony up for the lease payment extension (in exchange for us not pulling the gas out of the ground).

Alternatively, Bridgeline is willing to step into our shoes and purchase the gas from us for resale to Gulf South (once GS get their permits) as long as Gulf South provides Bridgeline with a firm purchase commitment at some date in the future (independent of the FERC permitting condition precedent).

Regards,
Brian

	Tim, 
	Here is the "Draft" CSA that we discussed.  As I mentioned, I have taken some time and worked
	in the specifics to our transaction.   This is a Draft that I need you to review and make comments
	back to me.  Since yourself, John and your Alliant resource are in town Monday & Tuesday, I would
	like to establish a time that I can meet and walk through the agreement and discuss any specifics.
	This would probably be most productive after you have had the opportunity to review but before you
	spend a lot of time trying to work everything out.  

	Either way, I'll make myself available Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning to meet.  Again, I want
	to re-enforce the need for us to get this document executed before the end of this month to take
	advantage of the equipment, installation and maintenance contract included in this Compression Service
	quote.  As always, the commodity pricing will need to be re-established at the time of our execution
	of the final CSA.

	There will also be a separate Maintenance Agreement whereby ECS will contract for all the maintenance
	services over the CSA's duration from the Start Date to the end of Term.  To ensure that we have no
	confusion, I'm assuming that Oakhill is providing day-to-day Operation of the facility the equipment and 
	your system.  Our Services will cover the "Electrical Drive System" up to the shaft of the compressors
	and we will have an option for the term maintenance of the remaining equipment on these skids (compressors,
	cylinders, valves, dumps, pre-lube system, etc.) 
		

 	
		 
	
	Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments between now and our meeting.  My office phone
	is 713-853-3463 and my cell phone is 713-851-7703.


	Thanks,
	Mark Knippa

Gerald,

Here is the information that you requested.

Counter party:  

Encore Acquisition Partners

Address:  

777 Main St., Ste. 1400
Fort Worth, TX 76102

Scope:  

The scope of this project is to analyze, develop and propose a compression services package that will optimally manage Encore's current and future horsepower requirements.  In order to do this we will need to explain our financial structures and gain access to information pertaining to their compression facilities and existing power agreements. 

Email me with the completed CA so that I can forward it on to the client.

Thanks

Nathan B. Creech

football tix again so I am sure I will stop by there a couple of times this

last year in school.  The hours weren't conducive to school, but my friends
really enjoyed the freebies!

      Yea, someone should have warned you about the drinks being poured at
   the
      ol' GK.  They tend to be pretty stiff.

      ...and ..."Swerve on?"  I have only a select group of friends who use
      such
      terminology - you must be one of those cool-guy types!

      A night out on Thursday sounds really good right now - maybe I will
   see
      you.  Downing Street is one of my favorite low-key spots - a bit of a
      meat
      market at times, but low key nonetheless.  Not to be rude, but to be
      thorough rather, would you describe yourself as blond or more of a
      brunette?

      Yea, we definitely had our swerve on that night.  I will have to have
   a
      talk with that bartender next time, because I was over-served.
   Probably
      not a good idea to start at GK at 6  and stay til 2 in the morning.

      Thanks for your gracious response.  Let me tell you, I had much
   debate
      over
      whether email was the appropriate communication medium or the phone.
   I
      was
      swung in favor of email to save myself the potential awkwardness of
   the
      following phone conversation scenario:

           Jennifer:  "Hello"
           Gerald:  "Hi, Jennifer, this is Gerald.  We met at the Gallant
      Knight
      on Friday"
           Jennifer:  "Who?"

      As I said Friday night was kind of hazy for me.  I'll probably be
      meeting
      some friends for happy hour on Thursday night at Downing Street.  If
   you
      and your friends are out, why don't you try and stop by.

      Gerald.

         Of course I remember you.  GK is really a great spot on Fridays -
      Looked
         like you guys were having a good time!
         I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.
      No
         worries.  While I've never been a big fan of unconventional dating
         practices (i.e. hooking up over the internet), i do fancy your
      approach
         of
         straightforward and clever ingenuity!!  And if you ever want to
   just
         have
         lunch or a drink anyway, let me know.

         Jen

         P.S.   Tell Mike "no worries"  as well!

         Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant
      Knight
         on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I
   had
         never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.
   Definition
      of
         "Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing
   me!"
         We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very
      charming.
         I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch
   or
      a
         drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or
      involved
         with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

         P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against
   him.
         ;-)

Stacy,  Susan called and asked that I prepare an assignment letter.  I will do so.  Could you send me a copy of the contract we are assigning and a copy of the assignment in interest letter.  Thanks.

OK folks, here's an update on Holcomb Oil and Gas Inc./Key Gas Holding, LLC.  The only active contract we have in place with Holcomb is an Enfolio II Spot and the interest assignment letter sent by Holcomb does not cover an agreement so broad.  I spoke with Susan Herrera at Holcomb [(505) 326-0550] and asked her to send an assignment letter.  She didn't seem to really understand what I needed to I also gave her Gerald's number in Legal.

Once we receive a good assignment, I will request that the Global Counterparty group set up the CP.  Sharon will process the assignment at that point.  Depending on whether we want to split deal 901255 or repath will depend on how long this process takes.  I will keep everyone informed in the meantime.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Kelli,

I'm not sure who normally submits request to the Global Counterparty group when you have new counterparties, but here is a link to the Lotus Notes request form.  You should be able to be see all the pertinent information needed by the GCP group besides contact name and address.  If you can supply this information, I'd be happy to submit the request for you.  Otherwise, please let me know if you find someone to finish this.  I don't have access to change the counterparty on the deal, so my group will not be able to attach a contract until the counterparty is there.

 << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Eva,

FYI - I called Mary Ogden today to follow-up on the status of the Napoleonville Land sale document filing (sale to TX Brine).  Mary said that she is still trying to locate the document(s).  She plans to finalize in one of two ways:  
1.  Our lawyers in Louisiana are going to send someone this week to check the Assumption Parish records (to see what was actually recorded);
2.  Mary sent an e-mail to a former Enron Landman (now AEP), Robert Rose.  Ann Elizabeth told Mary that Robert may have a copy of the document(s).

Thanks, Lisa

Mary,

Would you call AEW and find out where we can find a copy of the Tract 5B sale from Enron Storage Company to LRCI, Inc. here in our office--I know you are planning to call Sandi Braband; according to the message below, AEW must have done the work.

Also, would you please call Keith Daigle (I don't want to use Locke Lidell on this) and ask him to obtain a file stamped copy of "all" ESC conveyances to LRCI that are filed in the Assumption Parish Records.  Keith's phone number is 504-830-3990 or 985-898-1909.

Would you also ask Keith how he is coming on the Sorrento Right of Way Agreement that I sent him on July 7.  We need to have that back by the time Patrick Johnson returns next Monday.  Please give him a "gentle" prod. 

Thanks,

Steve

Steve - I have a few comments and inquiries, as follows:

An update on Tract 5B sale to TX Brine:
Paul Bieniawski spoke to Ann Elizabeth this afternoon and she told him that the law firm, Locklidell (sp.), dropped the ball and failed to file the appropriate papers with the authorities.  The papers should have been filed by now.  How can we confirm the filing? Do you have contacts at Locklidell (sp.)? Can we call the authorities? 

Proposed sale of Tracts 5A, 4B & 4A:
Since LRCI now owns the land as a result of the merger, does Enron have the authority to sale the property and thus keep 100% of any sales proceeds?

Also, I meant to mention to you earlier that I am working on another deal (Keystone/Unocal) which incorporates both compression and storage; Northern Natural Gas is involved as well and we need your help in generating a term sheet.  I will call you tomorrow to discuss further.

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik

Gerald,

Have you been able to get the Credit Ticket for the Enron North America/Upstream Master?
Have you had a chance to discuss the Master Committed Reserves contract with Jeff Hodge? 

Thanks,
Judy

Mary,

Please give to Gerald Nemec.  One of Patrick Johnson's people has been trying to sell our interest.  I think Rhaki Israni or Brandie Morris.

Steve:  During a recent visit to AEP, Ann Elizabeth gave me a working file re Matagorda Terminal.  Do you know who is handling that matter in Legal now?  I want to be sure and pass the file along to the right person.  It's not being handled by Gerald.

Thank for thinking about this,

Patrick,  

Which 2 acres is Bridgeline purchasing?  I have a Survey updated as of August 14, 2000 Listing  6 Parcels.  If you can point me to the relevant properties, I'll instruct Keith Daigle as to what we need in the way of a Deed transferring the relevant property to Bridgeline.

Thanks,

Steve

Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

	The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
	Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
	Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.
	Legal Directories Publishing Company, Inc. will begin publishing
annual editions of the Pictorial Roster, rather than every two years. The
HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so
please take advantage of this opportunity.

Hey, I may be in Houston after I get back from Alaska.  I'll let you know
and hope to be able to see you guys!

The rumor is that Mark is going to be moving back to Houston.  He is now
interviewing with companies out there! Lucky you! ;o)

  We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao
for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that
Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty
incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.

Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being
out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was
in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.
Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?

Gerald, we recently placed a $50,000 bond for HPL for Franchise Tax Certification for you.  

I understand from our broker, John L. Wortham that our surety, St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine was informed that Marsh USA will be handling the HPL bonds effective 06-01-01 (please see attached email).

I am attaching a list of outstanding bonds that HPL has in place.   Should these bonds be canceled? Or if these bonds are still required, you may wish to consider placing with your new agent of record, Marsh USA.  They can either be replaced all at once or just prior to expiration. 

Please note while most of the bonds were placed with St. Paul/Seaboard Fire & Marine there are a couple that were placed with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.   

Please let me know how you wish to handle the outstanding bonds.. Thanks.  

If you have questions, please give me a call 713 853-5687.

Mary, we have received information from Roger Bumgarner at St. Paul/Seaboard that Marsh USA has been appointed agent of record effective June 1, 2001 on the HPL bonds he writes.

As you know, there are three bonds with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and two through Insurance Company of North America.  I presume we will  be receiving notice that Marsh has been appointed on them, also.   However, we have not yet received information to that effect.

I'm not sure what Dan's rationale was, but he's no longer here to ask.  Maybe we can have Gerald Nemec or Stacy Dickson Granmayeh look into it.  My documentation shows that Crestar Energy Inc. became Gulf Canada Resources Limited due to an amalgamation effective 03/01/01.  I don't have the documentation in hand but I can get a copy from the Global Counterparty group if necessary.  I don't understand why the deal should remain Crestar unless it's really under a Crestar entity that may not have been affected by the amalgamation????

Patrice,

Should deal 821869 be booked under Gulf Canada Resources Limited or should it change to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Is there a point at which these deals will permanently remain under Gulf Canada Resources?  If not, can all future deals be moved over to Crestar Energy Marketing Corp.?  Please advise.

Thank you,

Gerald,
 
I spoke with Nelson about developing consistency in the language for all of our contracts. As for the Notice of Variance section, we would like to use "email, fax, phone or where an agency agreement governs, direct access to Operators" for all of our Reciprocal Keep Whole confirmations. Please feel free to reword, but our intent is to excuse the Producer if we have executed an agency agreement because we are contractually obligated to get that information.
 
Thanks,
Judy

Current Notes User:

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

	Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

	713-853-1411

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Gerald,

Can you send me the GTC portion of the confirm also. I can't find the original email that you sent that had it attached; and I need to send the blank form to one of Nelson's customers.

Thanks,
Judy

Today is the final day of the EWS United Way Leadership Giving Campaign and we need your help!

If you have already made your pledge, thank you for your generosity.  If not, we need you to read on.

To date, we have pledges of $327,075, which is over 25% of our total EWS goal of $1,276,000 and over 42% of our EWS Leadership goal of $765,600.  This Leadership goal is 60% of the total EWS goal and we would like to have 100% participation from EWS Leadership.

Here are the pledge totals and participation rates by EWS Business Unit Group:

	Group			Pledge Total		Participation Rate
	EA			$39,275		3.54%
	EGM			$51,740		4.38%
	EIM			$42,515		11.35%
	ENW			$49,444		1.81%
	EEOS			$22,138		12.63%
	EWS HR		$5,460			4.17%
	EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
				$23,794		11.01%
	EWS Legal		$27,380		10.87%
	EWS Treasury		$12,236		42.86%
	EWS Research		$13,000		4.26%
	EWS Business Development
$10,588		37.50%

To meet our EWS Leadership goal, we need all of the EWS leadership to participate.  It only takes a couple of minutes.  Please click on https://hrglobal.enron.com/ and complete your online pledge.  You will need your GIS ID and password.  If you are not sure what your ID and password are, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the "Accept" button, and then click on "Forgot your User ID or Password?"

The company-wide campaign kicks off on Monday and we would like to announce to the EWS organization that the EWS leaders have set the pace for a successful campaign exceeding our goal of $765,600.  Your contribution will help make this happen.

Thank you in advance for your participation.

Jennifer Bello is a recruiter for Sedona Consulting here in Houston. She
does financial and accounting recruiting. She called me, and I thought of
your brother.
Her number is: 713.868.3960, and e-mail is jobs@sedonaconsulting.net

Didn't know if he would be interested. I also have that contact for the
legal recruiters if you get in trouble.

Per my discussions with John Grass, we have decided to allow the Force Majeure for the September 11 - 15th; however, we will not allow the September 10th Force Majeure. Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from us in order to bring this issue to closure.

They would like Jul to be part of the deal (too late I know) I'll ask what they wish to do.
I do not believe they are hedged (hard to imagine)
The generation they are delaying is not permitted yet and has not been in the press yet.
They have told me they do not have issues around showinging us the supply contract (I've asked twice)

Dave, let's discuss.. Jay, I know that this does not represent the definative agreement but as a starter we would easily do part 1, and part 2 is where the complicated issues lie.

We clearly need to understand the contractual arrangements they have with the third party.... if we go with part 2.  Dave, what are their plans to liquidate their july position? Do they have any hedges on now?  What generation asset are they delaying... ( important info). Get ENA a copy of all purchase and sale agreements including ( executed copies/originals). Make sure that they do not have confidentiality issues related to the confirms... If they do not, then we can look at them... if they do have CA issues then Gerald is advising me that they will need the consent of the seller to let ENA look at agreements.

Thanks to each of you who help in the review process yesterday.  As many of you know, we found that several of the contracts that we reviewed did reconcile with the Total Exposure (in other words, the agreements were not the right ones).  Eric Moon and Russell Diamond are working with IT, Credit and Risk to access deal specific information in a way that will let us link deal numbers to contract numbers.  Thereafter we can get the right agreements and finish the process.  I will update you later today on the status.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Do you know who is responsible for cancelling the operating permits for HPL Compression?  Zero Gross Receipt Tax reports will have to be filed quarterly until that permit is canceled.

We're on the 5th floor of the new building--it was full--there's only about 20% of us left.  I've never been through anything like this, so yesterday was very hard for both Paula (she's still here, too!) and myself--to watch alot of our group walking out the door.  It's pretty quiet here, too.

Gerald -
Thanks.  As discussed earlier, I accepted all of your changes except the item in Section 14. 

In the meantime, we have reworked the language in Non-Binding Sections 12 & 13 to further clarify the power rates and terms.  Please review.  
 
Also, the Term language (in red) in Binding Section 1 below seems to give NICOR an out and seems to contradict the exclusivity clause?  Please explain.

Term.  This Agreement shall remain in force and effect until the earliest to occur of the following events:  (i) an entity or entities other than the Parties enter into a definitive agreement(s) for the compression services; or (ii) April 1, 2002 (the "Term").  The provisions of Section 3, Confidentiality, shall survive any termination of this Agreement, as necessary for them to expire according 

Thanks, Lisa Druzbik
3-9620

Gerald:

	Once again, thanks for jumping in and getting these done.  I have looked over the documents and find them to be consistent with the telephone conversations we had.  In particular, the changes you made to the Master Agreement make it much better than the draft I left with you.  The only thought relates to the Transaction Agreement.  It would be my preference to call it a "Transaction  Agreement" rather than a "Confirmation".  I think that would be more consistent with the terminology in the Master Agreement.

	Again, thanks for your efforts here.

Jeff

Louis DiCarlo called and needed the binder back on the Pluto contracts.  He said you had given them your opinion so he thought you were through with them.  He needed them returned and so I gave them to him.  There was a memo sitting on top of the binder but I did not give it to him.  It is still on your bookcase.  Hope it was okay.  Rae

G--
Next week when you get settled in, call me and I will come over to discuss this agreement and the Trading Partner agreements that Jeff Hodge has asked that I hand off to you (I know you love that but know that I suggested Stacey get the TPA's--but Jeff thought you were the man!!) Mary O will be handling most of the routineTPA issues---

This Tenaska contract has been out there for a long time and i had tried from time to time to get an OK from Darren and Rick Hill--but, in true Enron form, what was an emergency in october you couldn't pay people to deal with in April--Darren did respond to me at the end of May when I was in the throws of Triple Lutz and I think he is now interested in wrapping this up--I told him I was passing it along to you--it should just be some tweeking--but we can chat next week! Hope China was awesome--We will all miss you!

Sandi, 

I don't think that the Agency agreement is going with HPL.  If that has changed, please let me know.  I asked Dave Baumbach about it and he agreed with me.

As far as signing the agreement, I need one thing added.  Under Section 4.A., we need to add something like, "IN the event that ENA owes Company, payment will be made to Company after ENA has received funds from third party sales of excess supply."  This situation has occurred when the plant was down for the majority of the month.  ENA sold the supply and net owed Tenaska IV a large sum of money after the admin fee was netted out.

Additionally, TXU pipeline has sent an amendment to the transport contract (adding receipt points).  The contract still has Tenaska Gas Co as a counterparty, instead of Enron North America.  How do we get this corrected?

RE:     Online CLE Seminars Available in July


As a fellow Texas legal professional, I would like to apprise you of the
following CLEonline.com seminars taking place in the month of July,
in which you or some of your colleagues or associates may be interested.
All of these seminars are fully accredited for PARTICIPATORY CLE credits
(not self-study) by the State Bar of Texas, and all are open and available,
24-hours a day, through the last day of this month.  Most will also be repeated
next month.

    There is NO LIMIT on the number of CLE credits you can earn

Hmm? Blond or brunette.  Really a blond trapped in a brunette's body.  Now
my turn.

Would you rather eat white or wheat bread?

   Yea, someone should have warned you about the drinks being poured at the
   ol' GK.  They tend to be pretty stiff.

   ...and ..."Swerve on?"  I have only a select group of friends who use
   such
   terminology - you must be one of those cool-guy types!

   A night out on Thursday sounds really good right now - maybe I will see
   you.  Downing Street is one of my favorite low-key spots - a bit of a
   meat
   market at times, but low key nonetheless.  Not to be rude, but to be
   thorough rather, would you describe yourself as blond or more of a
   brunette?

   Yea, we definitely had our swerve on that night.  I will have to have a
   talk with that bartender next time, because I was over-served.  Probably
   not a good idea to start at GK at 6  and stay til 2 in the morning.

   Thanks for your gracious response.  Let me tell you, I had much debate
   over
   whether email was the appropriate communication medium or the phone.  I
   was
   swung in favor of email to save myself the potential awkwardness of the
   following phone conversation scenario:

        Jennifer:  "Hello"
        Gerald:  "Hi, Jennifer, this is Gerald.  We met at the Gallant
   Knight
   on Friday"
        Jennifer:  "Who?"

   As I said Friday night was kind of hazy for me.  I'll probably be
   meeting
   some friends for happy hour on Thursday night at Downing Street.  If you
   and your friends are out, why don't you try and stop by.

   Gerald.

      Of course I remember you.  GK is really a great spot on Fridays -
   Looked
      like you guys were having a good time!
      I found you quite nice as well, but I am currently dating someone.
   No
      worries.  While I've never been a big fan of unconventional dating
      practices (i.e. hooking up over the internet), i do fancy your
   approach
      of
      straightforward and clever ingenuity!!  And if you ever want to just
      have
      lunch or a drink anyway, let me know.

      Jen

      P.S.   Tell Mike "no worries"  as well!

      Hi Jennifer,  I don't know if you remember, but we met at Gallant
   Knight
      on Friday night.  I was with Mike Robison and the Enron group.  I had
      never been there before, but that place is alot of fun.  Definition
   of
      "Swanky".  You are probably wondering, "Why is this guy emailing me!"
      We'll, I will be straightforward and say that I found you very
   charming.
      I wanted to see if you would be interested in meeting me for lunch or
   a
      drink afterwork!  I apologize in advance if you are dating or
   involved
      with someone, but I thought I would take that chance.

      P.S.  Mike gave me your email address, but don't hold it against him.
      ;-)

Jeff, 

I will be meeting with the Texas land office on Thursday morning and would like to send them the attached tomorrow for their review prior to the meeting.  The attached is a Letter of Understanding (drafted by me based on your prior letter of understanding).  It is specific to the Kathleen Ann storage field and includes the current owner of the field as a third party to the letter. 

If at all possible, I would like you (or your designee) to review, modify and resend to me so that I can send it to the land office tomorrow.

Thanks,
Brian.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Uh, oh.  What do we do now?  I hate to send it to contract records undated, because I know that's the first thing they'll need to know for their database.  -Mary

Dear Shonnie:  Do you recall when the Gas Gathering Agreement between ENA and the subject entity was signed in July?  The execution version is not dated, and I want to write the correct date in before I send it to the global database people for inclusion in the database.

Many thanks,

I know that you were sitting there feeling sorry for me about having to work
so I thought I would give you an update.  WE DON'T HAVE TO WORK THIS
WEEKEND...yeah!  We are not flying out to Atlanta until the following week.
We spoke with the Travel Agent and she told us that she does not think that
we would be able to get our flight out!

Anyway, getting my remote control is on my list of things to do.  Will you be
around this weekend?  If so, maybe I can stop by and pick it up.  You can
always leave it in your mailbox, too!  Just let me know what works and we can
play it by ear!!

Gerald,

Are you familiar with the above two projects?  Maricela Trevino (ext. 53681) and Gareth Bahlmann (37295) in Global Finance are trying to locate the attorney that worked on these two projects.  Last May I helped Roger Balog put together a crude confirmation for Lost Creek and that is the extent of my knowledge on that matter.  

Thanks.
Nony

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.
