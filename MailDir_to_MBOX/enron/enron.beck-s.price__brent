More detail than you probably want on the document I gave you at the 
Doubletree....  Mike was responding to an email that Steve Young had sent 
him.  Just wanted you to know that this is moving forward and that I will 
coordinate the Houston side of this for now (I will coordinate London going 
forward if that responsibility is given to me).  Let me know if you have 
questions.

Steve

My assessment of the next steps are as follows :-

We finalise the intial draft of the one page summary  - Action Mike/Brent to 
consolidate feedback to date - to be delivered tomorrow
The one pager to be sent to all business heads commenting on John's belief ( 
which I think we all share ) that the Business unit head has ultimate 
responsibility to ensure operating standards are met and that we aim to 
provide them with a joint summary of 'status' from Commercial Support and 
RAC. This summary could be reviewed by AA, but I believe the process would be 
more beneficial if it is 
a self assessment process
escalates judgement on material issues 
capable of being monitored and repeated on an agreed frequency
complimentary to the BRM process
The timeline for thie intial feedback could be within one week - I have an 
assessment from David Port to match to ours already!

As to your other questions

I will be adding two additional detail points within the required structure 
definition - ie the structure must have :-

Full functionality and interfaces for market risk, credit risk and Corporate 
reporting, and/or a systems roadmap for that development
Appropriate involvement in business for specialist services ( Legal, Tax and 
HR )

The Operating Standards MUST only cover one page to retain the ease of 
communication for them - the above definitions identify that businesses must 
consider all Legal and RAC issues - and there will significant detail 
involved in that - which will be defined elsewhere ( see David's separate 
comments on risk reporting )

In summary I think it is best to move to publish the intial draft to 
stimulate communication  - would welcome your thoughts

Mike

 - some changes  -awaiting possible additions from Brent  - if none - to be 
published tomorrow

Subject: Re: Revised Operating Standards  

Mike: 

Is this the most current version of the proposed Operating Standards?  Since 
I've been out of the office since we last discussed, I wanted to get an 
update on the status.  A couple of questions: 

What are the next steps? 
How will this be communicated and to whom?
How do you see this being implemented to best assure it is respected?
Legal Standards are absent?  I suspect this is still in draft form and they 
are to follow in the next version; however, let me know how you see legal 
Standards playing into this as I believe they should be on this list as well.

As discussed, I strongly believe that a brief and clear list of "absolutes" 
similar to the attachment will be most useful if first agreed by all that 
need to be involved and then effectively communicated and respected by all in 
EEL.  Let me know if this list is now considered representative of the views 
of all that need to have input.  I suggest we meet again with a broader group 
to assure this list is complete and to discuss next steps.  I have some 
suggested adjustments but will get back to you by end of week with comments 
or questions from RAC after we discuss this in our weekly RAC manager's 
meeting.   

Thanks,

Steve

This goes to a discussion I had with Jeff this morning.  We have had IT 
problems of some sort or another every day this week which has prevented us 
from getting the daily reports out by 8:30 (our target time with Jeff).  I 
have talked to Steve Stock and Richard Burchfield and have been trying to 
reach Beth for a few days to determine what can be done from an IT 
perspective.  The problem is that it is not the same thing but has been a 
different problem every day (metacalc, servers going down, Lotus Notes 
problems...).  I will talk to Beth and let you know if we need to escalate.  
I would hope she would dedicate the appropriate resources to ensure that 
these problems do not continue.

Souad,

There are expiration dates for swaptions/options on the "Detail" button in 
TAGG Deal Capture.  Let's
do the following.  Go into TAGG Deal Capture and check to make sure these 
dates are valid for swaptions/options.

We will write a report that you can run that identifies deals that are  
expiring.

Thanks, Ron

Subject: TAGG modification request

Ron,

A series of significant events took place this week where it made it more 
apparent that a modification in Tagg is highly needed.   Without going into a 
lot of detail regarding the events, the modification desired is simply an 
Expiration Date field for certain types of transactions (Swaptions), where a 
date is keyed by the user at the time the trade is entered into TAGG.  In 
addition, this feature will permit TAGG to prompt the user or users with a 
message box of the Expiration date and associated Deal Number at a later 
time, before the expiration date becomes current (i.e. a week before the 
expiration date becomes current).  

This request carries a lot of value for it allows ENA to avoid a variety of 
risks underlying missing execution of certain types of trades.  This issue 
was addressed in the past and I would like to raise it again.

Can we implement such modification? Your prompt response is highly needed and 
your feedback is appreciated.  

Thanks. 


I work on the confirmation desk, reporting to Jeff Sorenson.  Please call me 
if you have any questions or suggestions (X37580).

We have all talked and are in agreement that financial confirms/settlements 
are the responsibility of Kim Theriot.  Leslie is going to sent out a memo 
discussing the organizational changes within that group that will clearly 
communicate that message to all of wholesale.  Let me know if you have any

This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my 
office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on 
financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't  
clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at 
a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said 
that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff 
to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and 
settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There 
should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms 
and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks.

I was going to write that the buying and selling of physical commodity 
locally was OK, but that hedging had to be done with Regional Hub. The 
problem with this model is that it describes Helsinki before the bust!

Another possiblity is the agency model, where the local trader acts under the 
direction of the hub trader. This is where Helsinki currently is (although we 
also have an independent manager on site). However, I am not so happy with 
this, and Rick Causey certainly does not like it. Perhaps we should recommend 
independent Risk Managers in every office, but all correspondence and 
settlement with regional hub?

Rick - You had asked a while back for a matrix that captures all of the 
different systems used by commodity, by office and by functional group.  This 
(draft) version encompasses Houston and London activities.  We will expand 
this document to include other offices and products in the next few months.  
Let me know your questions and comments.

As you all are aware, there is a heightened awareness throughout the company 
of the need for establishing global trading control standards and developing 
a process by which we will track and monitor on a regular basis our success 
at achieving those standards.  I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on 
meeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in 
an extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their 
gas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review 
to start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement 
methodology for the London office.

In order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards 
across Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment 
for the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and 
other commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and 
Wednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.

I have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so 
that we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those 
control requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not 
operating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to 
develop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:
 - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash 
collections are timely)
 - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its 
maximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date 
with            exceptions noted)
 - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard 
(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)
 - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each 
measurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)

I would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control 
functions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of 
work has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time 
requirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to 
be completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a 
high level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but 
it is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.

As discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for 
each functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk 
associated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and 
power operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know 
if you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward 
to seeing you next week.

FYI...according to Jeff, by the end of today the only position that will 
require manual adjustment is an IM Canada position (60 K's) that will be 
fixed next Monday when Kam Keiser goes back to Calgary.  Everything else is 
now automatically feeding to the GRMS system (and VAR calculations) without 
human intervention.

Steve - Mike asked  me to send him a list of what we had done to improve the 
top-level adjustments on the Benchmark.  Here are the things which we 
discussed earlier.

Mike - Let me know if you need anything else.

We have lowered the number of top-level adjustments substantially this week.  
We have taken several steps in order to achieve this.

1.  We had to adjust formatting in all text files which go into GRMS.  
2.  We are using a flip-out book for all Canadian deals done with the U.S. 
office so that Canadian positions are pulling in correctly.
3.  We had to adjust many book names in order that GRMS would pull the books 
into the system.  
4.  We had to change region codes in the system so that GRMS would pull in 
more than one book per region.

Issues remaining:

Intra-Month Canada
Chicago
Storage and Intra-East

Intra-month Canada - We have a risk person from the U.S. office going to 
Canada on Monday to fix their problems.
Chicago -  will be fixed by the end of the day.  System is looking for the 
wrong portfolio code.
Storage and Intra-East - Also will be fixed by the end of the day.  Overide 
books need to be set up.

Thanks

JG

Fernley - attached as discussed, initial gas & power operating standards for 
Houston.  We will use these as a basis for comparison with other offices and 
ultimately the development of global standards across the company.

Sally - you may have seen these already but I wanted to make sure you had a 
copy.

Call me with any questions or comments.
