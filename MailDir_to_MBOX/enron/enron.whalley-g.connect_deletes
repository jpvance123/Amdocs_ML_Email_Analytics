"Well, if you're a fan of chaos, you're in Nirvana."
- John Shubin [Florida Elections Expert] MSNBC, 12/08/00

_________________________________________________________________


1
SUMMARY OF FLORIDA SUPREME COURT DECISION

~ A deeply divided Florida Supreme Court has opened up a Pandora's
  box of inconsistent standards, flawed hand counting, and delays
  that call into question Florida's ability to be represented in
  the Electoral College.

~ Further, the court's narrow, liberal majority has made a mockery
  of the idea of "counting every vote" by selecting only certain
  ballots and providing no standard to count them.  The four
  activist justices rewrote Florida's election laws after the
  election -- a clear violation of federal law.

~ Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Wells offered a stinging and
  forceful dissent; concluding:

  ~ "The majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which
    will certainly immediately follow under the United States
    Constitution"

  ~ "The majority's decision to return the case to the circuit
    court for a count of the under-votes from Miami-Dade County or
    all counties has no foundation in the law of Florida as it
    existed on November 7, 2000..."

  ~ "I have a deep and abiding concern that the prolonging of
    judicial process in this counting contest propels this country
    and this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary
    constitutional crisis.

  ~ Judge Wells said the county-by county decision-making on the
    "clear indication of the intent of the voter":  "is fraught with
    equal protection concerns which will eventually cause the
    election results in Florida to be stricken by the federal courts
    or Congress."

~ For example, in Miami-Dade County, the justices reinstated 168
  votes that were awarded to Gore as the result of manual recounts
  conducted in only some precincts - all of them overwhelmingly
  Democratic. This would be the ultimate in treating some votes
  differently from others.

~ The Court ordered a recount of all counties' undervotes, but
  there are five major problems:

  ~ First, in many counties the undervotes aren't even segregated,
    so they will have to be machine tabulated and separated. We
    know this causes chads to fall off ballots and other
    degradation of ballots.

  ~ Second, 16 counties don't even know which of their non-votes
    are undervotes and which are overvotes.

  ~ Third, even in counties that have attempted to separate the
    undervote, there are serious problems. In Miami-Dade, the
    number of undervotes submitted to the Circuit Court is
    different from the number identified in the November 8
    machine recount. There can be no confidence that the pool of
    undervotes is untainted and consistent.

  ~ Fourth, the majority accepted two different standards (the
    liberal Broward standard and the more objective Palm Beach
    standard) further proving votes are treated differently in
    each county.

  ~ Fifth, as Chief Justice Wells said, the liberal court
    majority failed "to make provision for: (1) the
    qualifications of those who count; (2) what standards are
    used in the count-are they the same standards for all
    ballots statewide or a continuation of the county-by-
    county constitutionally suspect standards; (3) who is to
    observe the count; (4) how one objects to the count; (5)
    who is entitled to object to the count; (6) whether a
    person may object to a counter; (7) the possible lack of
    personnel to conduct the count; (8) the fatigue of the
    counters; and (9) the effect of the differing intra-county
    standards.

DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS

"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand
scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United
States Constitution."

Excerpt:

"I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that
I do not question the good faith or honorable intentions of my
colleagues in the majority.  However, I could not more strongly
disagree with their decision to reverse the trial court and
prolong this judicial process.  I also believe that the majority's
decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will certainly
immediately follow under the United States Constitution.

"My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no
foundation in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000,
or at anytime until the issuance of this opinion.  The majority
returns the case to the circuit court for this partial recount of
under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at best, ambiguous
standards with authority to obtain help from others, the
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally
unknown.  That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems
that the majority creates.

"This case has reached the point where finality must take
precedence over continued judicial process.  I agree with a quote
from John Allen Paulos, a professor of mathematics at Temple
University, when he wrote that, "[t]he margin of error in this
election is far greater than the margin of victory, no matter who
wins."  Further judicial process will not change this self-evident
fact and will only result in confusion and disorder.  Justice
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of
action sixty-four years ago.  I would heed that sound advice and
affirm Judge Sauls.

STATEMENT BY FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE JAMES A. BAKER, III
December 8, 2000

Ladies and Gentlemen,

This has been a rather eventful day here in Tallahassee.  Two
Circuit Court opinions throwing out challenges to absentee ballots
in Seminole and Martin counties.  A federal judge ordering the
counting of overseas absentee ballots in many counties that were
not counted for technical reasons.  And of course, the
disappointing 4 to 3 decision of the Florida Supreme Court just
announced, which will require manually recounting tens of
thousands of non-votes and undervotes in all Florida counties that
have not yet had a manual recount - and trying to do so by
December 12.

This is what happens when for the first time in modern history, a
candidate resorts to lawsuits to try to overturn the outcome of
an election for President.  It is very sad.  For Florida, for the
nation, and for our democracy.

Today's ruling by four justices of the Florida Supreme Court is of
course a disappointment.  Its reasoning and result place the Court
once again at odds with sound judgments of Florida's lower courts,
the Florida Legislature, local election officials, and, in our
view, the US Supreme Court.  This action will unfortunately
produce ongoing uncertainty and could ultimately disenfranchise
Florida's votes in the Electoral College.

The ruling of the Florida Court's four justices is flawed in much
the same way we think as its November 21 ruling that was vacated
unanimously by the United States Supreme Court.

Let me read you what Chief Justice Wells said in part of his
dissent today:
"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand the
scrutiny which will certainly immediately follow under the United
States Constitution...  [T]he majority's decision to return this
case to the circuit court for a count of the under-votes from
either Miami-Dade County or all counties has no foundation in the
law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at any time
until the issuance of this opinion...  [T]he prolonging of
judicial process in this counting contest propels this country and
this state into an unprecedented and unnecessary constitutional
crisis.  I have to conclude that there is a real and present
likelihood that this constitutional crisis will do substantial
damage to our country, our state, and to this Court as an
institution." [pp. 41-42]

We agree with the three justices who dissented from the action of
the other four.  We believe this ruling is inconsistent with
Florida law, federal law, and the United States Constitution.
Therefore, we have no alternative other than to appeal once again
to the United States Supreme Court for relief.  We have already
put in motion the process to do so.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING...

Judge Andrew Napolitano  [Fox News Legal Analyst]:  "...what is
this doing?  Changing the rules yet again, in the face of a federal
law that says you can't change counting procedures and rules after
six days prior to the election."
-Fox News Channel, 12/08/00


Jim Axelrod [CBS News Correspondent]: "One of the first people I
saw after the Supreme Court ruling was Dexter Douglass, a member of
the Gore legal team.  I asked him what was next.  He said, 'Chaos.'
So far, nothing's been done to help clarify the situation."
-CBS Evening News, 12/08/00


Tim Russert  [NBC News]:  "...we could have chaos and a
constitutional crisis...This is as close to a political civil war
as I've ever witnessed."
-NBC Nightly News, 12/08/00


Mike Isikoff  [Newsweek Magazine]:  "...The Republicans got a bit
of a shot in the arm.  I was just reading the dissent of Chief
Justice Wells on this case, and he is pretty stinging.  It is
surprising language from a chief justice of a state court.  He
pretty much says flatly that his colleagues were wrong as a matter
of law.  They're going to be reversed by--he predicts they will be
reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, and also projects--talks about
a constitutional crisis that is going to flow from this.  So if
the Republicans need some leg to hang their position on, they've
got it in this dissent..."

John Gibson:  "Mike Isikoff, a crucial question is here.  What
standard is this recount going to be counted under?  Any clue?"

Mike Isikoff:  "No.  That is exactly the question that I think is
going to loom largest over the next few days."

-Fox News Channel, 12/08/00

Subject: Justice Department Investigation

Louise --

I wanted to make sure you were aware that the Justice Department has launched 
an investigation into the online electronic bond trading site set up by 
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Chase, and others.   The Justice Department 
said that they are studying the "competitive issues that arise from such 
close cooperation among competitors."

I will monitor this very closely, as I'm sure it will have implications for 
the likes of ICE.

Hope you're doing well.

Lisa

Summary:

* Britain's Crown Estate (hereditary possessions of the Royal family)
has granted seventeen UK companies the option to build wind power generation
projects with a potential value of U$2.3 billion on their land.  Wind
turbine sites have been approved for several regions ranging from Scotland
to the south coast of England, however government and regulatory approval
remains necessary for the projects to go ahead.
* BP, together with the government of Spain and the Phillipines, plan
to build a $48 million solar power plant that will deliver electricity to
over 150 villages (400,000 residents) that are isolated in the Phillipines.
The system will be installed in two separate installments, the first of
which is planned for September.

I have received several calls this morning regarding the above, so apparently 
there is some doubt.  Please be advised that the executive committee will not 
meet today.  Further, due to travel schedules and the holidays, executive 
committee meetings will not be held on Monday, December 18 or Monday, 
December 25.  

Please make note that the next executive committee meeting will be held on 
Tuesday, January 2, 2001at 11:00 a.m. in EB50 Boardroom.

Don't hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.

Regards and Happy Holidays!

The EES VaR for today is $8.2 million, up from yesterday's Var of $5.0 
million, due to the short positions added to the Power West portfolio at NP 
and SP.   The VaR will decrease once the short positions that were recently 
added to cover the University of California system deal are removed due to 
EES' successful appeal.

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Senate Bill No. 1 ("SB 1X").  
The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (likely cessation of 
electricity sales and curtailment of investment in new generation assets) and 
constitutional deficiencies of SB 1X.  Please note, SB 1X will not apply to 
sales of electricity made pursuant to binding written contracts executed on 
or before the date SB 1X is signed into law (if ever).  

The California Senate has passed SB 1X.  The California Assembly has drafted 
their own version, Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 128X"), which the Assembly is 
presently debating.  A Tax Review of AB 128X is also attached.

We will keep you advised regarding the progress of both SB 1X and AB 128X.  
Please advise if you have questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

ENW VENTURES PORTFOLIO NEWS

Acta's New B2B Data Server Now Available for Multiple Operating Platforms; 
ActaWorks 4.4 Significantly Expands Support for Industry-Leading Data 
Integration Solutions

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., the leader 
in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, announced today the general 
availability of ActaWorks 4.4, the latest version of its award winning 
enterprise data server. ActaWorks 4.4 provides recent product and performance 
enhancements that previously were available only for Windows NT (under 
ActaWorks 4.3). Acta made the announcement at the eBusiness Conference and 
Expo in New York City. 
The new product significantly expands support for the industry-leading 
provider of B2B data integration. With ActaWorks 4.4, businesses with Windows 
NT, Windows 2000, and Unix environments (HP-UX, Sun Solaris, and IBM AIX) can 
all employ Acta's new enhancements for packaging and delivering the data 
essential for B2B eCommerce and business intelligence. 
Among the new features is a repository architecture that enables centralized 
metadata management and multi-user development. As businesses implement a 
data platform to support both internal and external access to enterprise 
data, the need to manage metadata from external and internal sources becomes 
critical -- and the need for multiple users increases. 
The addition of these new enhancements further solidifies Acta's leadership 
position in B2B data integration, a rapidly emerging component of B2B 
integration. Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B 
(cumulative) by 2005 -- a market that is being driven by the growing need to 
provide information-rich data both inside and outside the extended 
enterprise.

Trade-Ranger integrates multiple buying programs

HOUSTON, Dec. 13 -- Trade-Ranger, an Internet marketplace for the procurement 
of supplies by the energy industry, has integrated another type of software 
into its site to eliminate barriers to its customers and to help build 
liquidity. 
Allen May, interim co-CEO, told LocalBusiness.com the site has added another 
buying tool, iPlanet BuyerXpert software, at the request of one of its 
founding partners. Trade-Ranger already had Oracle Corp.'s iProcurement and 
Commerce One's e-procurement programs. 
"Our members are transacting, we have integrated multiple buying tools to the 
Commerce One platform, and we are continuing our effort to build the most 
efficient content hub in the industry," May said. 
"We will adopt the best-of-breed technology," he said. 
Houston-based Trade-Ranger was incorporated in August. Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) 
is based in Redwood City, Calif., while Commerce One (Nasdaq: CMRC) is based 
in Pleasanton, Calif. Meanwhile, iPlanet is a product of iPlanet E-Commerce 
Solutions, a Sun-Netscape Alliance. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is based 
in Palo Alto, Calif. 
Trade-Ranger is building its membership, and no numbers were immediately 
available, May said. 
Technology can be a barrier to liquidity growth, May said. Some marketplaces 
simply tell customers they must adopt that marketplace's technology, he said. 
"We definitely have an open policy," May said. 
He added that Trade-Ranger has made a significant investment in technology, 
although he was unwilling to disclose the amount spent. 
Formerly the Energy and Petrochemical Exchange, the Houston-based exchange 
announced its formation on April 11. The exchange describes itself as 
"created by the industry for the industry." 
Membership is available to all companies, buyers and sellers, in the 
upstream, downstream, retail and petrochemical sectors. Upstream refers to 
oil and gas producers, while downstream refers to the refining section of the 
business. 
The original 14 founding partners are Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, TotalFinaElf, 
The Dow Chemical Co., Conoco Inc., Motiva Enterprises, Occidental Petroleum, 
Equilon Enterprises, Phillips Petroleum, Mitsubishi Corp., Repsol, YPF, 
Statoil, Unocal and Tosco. 
The collective annual purchasing budgets of the founding partners exceeds 
$125 billion worldwide.

GM, Ford take $1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One software company

12/12/2000 
The Canadian Press 
Copyright (c) 2000 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved. 
DETROIT (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will take a combined 
$1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One, making the business-to-business 
software company a technology partner in the automakers' Covisint online 
exchange. 
Pleasanton, Calif.-based Commerce One said it will issue to GM and Ford 14.4 
million shares apiece, with each stake valued at about $631.8 million, based 
on Commerce One's close Tuesday of $43.88 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The 
combined number of shares represents a 14 per cent interest in Commerce One. 
Half the shares for each company will be held in escrow until 2002, and will 
be released to Ford and GM upon satisfaction of certain conditions. If 
conditions are not met, the shares will be released to the two automakers in 
mid-2004. 
Commerce One said it will undergo a corporate restructuring into a holding 
company and get a two per cent equity interest in Covisint, the Internet 
exchange started by Ford, GM and three other automakers. Covisint 
incorporated for business Monday. 
Commerce One's stake in Covisint will be held in escrow until the completion 
of the restructuring, on which Commerce One shareholders are to vote next 
year. 
Commerce One will be entitled to a share of the revenue generated by the 
Covisint exchange for an expected 10-year term, as well as be paid for 
consulting services it provides to Covisint. 
``We look forward to continuing our efforts with Covisint to deliver a global 
e-marketplace platform for the automotive industry,'' Mark Hoffman, Commerce 
One's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ``Covisint is an 
excellent example of Commerce One's business model and reflects our 
commitment to moving the world's business commerce onto the Web.'' 
In addition to Ford and GM, Covisint's backers include DaimlerChrysler AG, 
Nissan and Renault, as well as Commerce One and fellow software firm Oracle. 
Covisint is supposed to act as an Internet marketplace for the auto industry, 
allowing suppliers and automakers to swap information and conduct business 
far more quickly and cheaply than they have in the past. 
Detroit's automakers have said Covisint should be able to route their 
purchases of $250 billion a year in goods and services. 
Covisint said it has more than 250 customers on two continents already using 
its services, including catalogues, auctions, quote management and 
collaborative design.

Summary:

* Toyota Managing Director Hiroyuki Watanabe commented that broad
cooperation was needed on fuel cell technology development as it pertains to
vehicles in order to commercialize the technology for this application.
While Toyota continues to develop hybrid vehicles, Watanabe believes fuel
cell vehicle technology has high hurdles to overcome.  In February the
automaker unveiled a prototype fuel cell vehicle, the FCHV-3, which also
includes a secondary nickel-metal hydride battery.

Attached please find a Tax Review of California Assembly Bill No. 128 ("AB 
128X").  The Tax Review sets out the practical implication (increased cost to 
purchasers) and constitutional deficiencies of AB 128X.

The third paragraph of the Tax Review details the mathematical computation of 
the tax and the resulting purchaser price increase.  The computation sales 
price, $300/MWh, reflects the SP15 (Southern California) weighted average 
index price ($302.88), rounded to the nearest hundred, as reported in 
Megawatt Daily's May 8th MarketReport.  However, it may be more effective to 
present the mathematical computation with a price closer to the proposed base 
price of $60/MWh.  We are available to assist in presenting the computation 
utilizing whichever numbers you deem appropriate.

The California Senate has passed SB 1X, Windfall Profits Tax on Electric 
Generators.  We will forward a similar memorandum addressing SB 1X.

We are available to address questions and/or comments.  Thanks.

USA: Dynegy trades $1.5 bln via online energy portal.

HOUSTON, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Wholesale natural gas and electricity marketer 
Dynegy Inc. said on Monday its Dynegydirect Internet trading system had 
chalked up $1.5 billion in notional transaction values since its launch on 
Nov. 1. 
Dynegydirect (www.dynegydirect.com) currently carries Dynegy's bid and offer 
prices for over 300 energy and energy-related products, including North 
American electricity, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 
Coal, emission allowances and weather derivatives will be offered in the 
first quarter of 2001, with international energy products and 
telecommunications bandwidth following in the second quarter, Houston-based 
Dynegy said in a statement. 
Dynegydirect currently has over 400 registered users and Dynegy said that 
over $1 billion of the deals done to date over the system were generated by 
new customers for the company. 
In addition to its own portal, Dynegy has been trading on the Tradespark 
(www.trade-spark.com) multilateral online energy trading platform launched in 
September. 
Tradespark is backed by a partnership of several energy companies, including 
Williams Cos., TXU Corp. and privately owned Koch Industries. Dynegy has said 
it will join the partnership at a later date. 
Dynegy's home-town rival Enron Corp. is regarded as the frontrunner in online 
trading of wholesale energy products, with deals worth $183 billion 
transacted over its EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com) system between November 
1999 and October 2000. 
Enron executives have said they also plan to use other online trading 
platforms to do business and will not focus exclusively on the company's own 
platform.

Bankruptcy in California; Implications for our Growth Energy Names

* We would not sell Energy Merchants/Power Producers on news that PCG
has declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
* Ongoing payments in California are being made by the state;
therefore do not anticipate material exposure for ongoing earnings.
* Primary exposure is current receivables: (1) these one-time amounts
are limited (roughly estimate max. of 50% of 2001 earnings); and (2) we
expect that, as trade creditors, they will get high priority in a bankruptcy
proceeding. We think most of these amounts are likely to be recoverable,
although a significant (perhaps several year) delay is possible as these
claimants work their way through the bankruptcy process.
* By our rough estimation, companies with fairly significant one-time
earnings exposure include:  NRG, MIR, DYN, CPN.  Companies with fairly small
exposure include:  ENE, AES, WMB, EPG and DUK.

Ca energy issues are out of control. Consumer groups are screaming about 
gouging. I will email today's articles from the Chronicle. The market has 
gone down more today with MSFT info after hours. Will keep being choppy. Glad 
no further rearrangements at ENE. You mentioned Bonds the other day, do you  
want some tax free muni ideas. If so how far out would you be comfortable 
with? I will talk to my Dallas muni desk for suggestions. How big was that 
check I was watching for? Ben

I'm not still short QQQ.  I covered at 68 1/2 in the after market while we
were on the phone, after the Florida supreme court statement.

The world has gone truly crazy about CA energy prices.

Not expecting any job changes due to the Skilling/Lay thing.  But a lot of
people are giving me shit anyway.  The recent reorganization that gave me
my current job was done so that Skilling wouldn't have to put anyone in the
COO position.

transfer the remaining to the LIR. QQQ improved for your short today to
close at 68 47/64. Nothing good out of CA utilities and power. Nat Gas
lower today. I will watch tonight the new President and the vanquished.
Also, will today's announcement about ENE effect you? Ben

Power Board's Industry Ties May Be Cut/Federal regulators consider making 
deregulation's creation independent
Susan Sward, David Lazarus


   As power prices skyrocket and California reels from the threat of
blackouts, the agency charged with overseeing the state's power grid has
come under increasing attack, and federal regulators are poised to order
sweeping changes in its governing board.
   Ever since the Legislature created the California Independent System
Operator four years ago, critics have lambasted the agency, saying it is
dominated by the power industry and does not have ratepayers' interests at
heart.
   Criticism of the ISO has grown as electricity reserves have dwindled and
as the agency has initiated statewide energy alerts that have required
hundreds of businesses to cut back their operations.
   "There are people on the ISO governing board who have a direct financial
interest in the policies they set," said Severin Borenstein, a professor
of business administration and public policy at the University of
California at Berkeley and the director of the University of California
Energy Institute.
   Today, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is expected to issue a
ruling that would remake the ISO's 26-member board, which includes
representatives of three investor-owned utilities, four municipal
utilities and two power generators.
   From its high-tech headquarters in Folsom -- reminiscent of NASA's mission
control center -- the nonprofit ISO essentially acts as traffic cop for a
power system that serves three-quarters of the state.
   Responsible for assuring a stable source of electricity, the ISO has the
authority to initiate emergency alerts and, if need be, rolling blackouts
if supplies drop to near nothing. By law, the utilities and power
generators must comply with ISO directives.
   Last month, federal regulators proposed an order calling for the ISO board
to be replaced by seven independent members. The new board would be
selected by the current ISO before it was replaced.
   Striving to restore order to the state's turbulent electricity market, the
commission said an overhaul of the ISO's management would be an important
first step toward easing the burden on consumers. CREATURE OF DEREGULATION
   The ISO was created as part of the Legislature's deregulation of the
state's electricity market in 1996. The Legislature set up the ISO as a
"stakeholder board" with designated seats for participants in the energy
marketplace.
   The theory was that those involved in the industry would be best able to
guarantee reliable electricity for the Bay Area and the other ISO-served
areas in California.
   "It was designed to be as neutral as possible," said Michael Shames,
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego.
"If anything, it's turned out to be far too cozy with power generators."
   State Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina Del Rey, said lawmakers were told that
the deregulation blueprint they adopted in 1996 was a better alternative
than more sweeping proposals being considered by the state Public
Utilities Commission.
   Lawmakers were reassured at the time that the deregulation plan, which was
intended to lower power prices by increasing competition, had the full
backing of utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric Co., power
generators and large users of electricity.
   "You have to remember that the political climate was different then," said
Bowen, the author of a pending measure replacing the existing ISO board
with one appointed by the governor and independent of the industry.
   "We had a Republican Assembly and a Republican governor (Pete Wilson) with
(his) appointees on the PUC with a free market point of view," Bowen said.
"The bargaining position of the ratepayers and consumer groups was not
strong." PRIVATE COMPANIES' LEVERAGE
   Doug Heller, assistant director of the Foundation for Consumer and
Taxpayer Rights, said the Legislature set up the ISO the way it did
because "it and the regulators were so transfixed with the idea of the
free market that they ignored the tremendous leverage they were handing
over to the private energy companies."
   He added, "Because the ISO has a mandate to keep the lights on and procure
power when the utilities are short, this energy industry-dominated board
has used its mandate as justification for gouging consumers."
   If the prices currently being paid for electricity are sustained over
time, Heller said ratepayers would have an average monthly bill of $620
and a small business paying a $1,000 monthly electricity tab could see its
bill jump to $10,000 based on current energy market prices.
   Federal regulators almost certainly will not let this happen. They are
expected to announce measures today intended to keep wholesale prices
stable and thus protect users from sharp increases in their power bills.
   The ISO is currently chaired by Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of
the Independent Energy Producers Association, a trade association whose
members generate about 24,000 megawatts of power in California.
   The board's members include representatives from two power generators,
Dynegy Inc. and an affiliate of Florida Power and Light; the state's three
investor-owned utilities, PG&E, Southern California Edison and San Diego
Gas and Electric; and four municipal utilities serving Los Angeles,
Sacramento, Silicon Valley and several Southern California communities.
   UC's Borenstein said the ISO board should be constituted along the lines
of New England's power agency where "you go out and find independent
experts in power, finance and economics. New England has had its ups and
downs, but I think there is a trust the New England board is acting in the
best interests of consumers." POWER PRICING GATEKEEPER
   Mike Florio, an attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco
and a member of the ISO board, said that although the composition of the
ISO board is only one element of the California energy crisis, the ISO "is
at the crux of the matter because it establishes and administers the state
market rules that determine how pricing gets done.
   "The ISO has been a law to itself -- with its attitude being: 'We keep the
lights on, we know what's going on and others should butt out,' " he said.
   If federal regulators order an overhaul of the ISO today, "that may just
be the beginning of the battle," Florio said. "If the changes they order
don't offer customers relief from the extremely high prices, TURN and
others will call for the state to buy the transmission system from the
utilities as a means of wrestling back control from FERC."
   For his part, the consumer network's Shames is proposing a merger of the
ISO and the California Power Exchange, which coordinates the wholesale
market, thereby creating a "superagency" with full powers of oversight and
enforcement.
   Yesterday, the idea of making the ISO board independent picked up some
utility support as well. PG&E, which serves millions of customers in
Northern and Central California, issued a statement that "to restore
public confidence, we agree with state and federal officials that the ISO
board needs to be independent."
   In any case, the ISO is not without its defenders. Barbara Barkovich, an
ISO board member who is a San Rafael consultant to large industrial
customers, said some of the criticism of the ISO has been unfair.
   "There are larger market forces at work here: Clearly, we have a tight
supply situation compared to demand -- which means there will always be
upward pressure on prices," Barkovich said. "We have had a situation where
prices out of state have recently been very high, meaning when anyone is
selling, they will go where prices are the highest." POWERFULLY NOBLE
CAUSE
   For its part, she said, the ISO "has seen its role as doing everything it
could to keep the lights on rather than have blackouts."
   Others say the ISO simply does not have sufficient enforcement powers to
make its orders stick in a volatile energy market.
   "The ISO is a flawed institution, but it is not responsible for the
shortages," said Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network.
   Such assertions do not halt the drive to reform the ISO's makeup.
   Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Monterey, is the author of one of several bills
now pending in the Legislature that would give Gov. Gray Davis authority
to appoint both a new ISO and a revamped Power Exchange.
   But he cautioned that if an ISO restructuring is all that happens, "We
might as well do nothing. It is only one element of the solution." MORE
REFORMS NEEDED
   Keeley said that for California to work through its energy crisis, several
major reforms must be put in place, including energy conservation moves,
as the state's population climbs by as much as 600,000 a year.
   One area crying out for attention, Keeley said, "is the demand side of the
market. When California found itself in an energy crisis in the 1970s, it
took good action on solar, renewable sources of energy, pricing and tax
actions in the law and do on."
   But he said that many of those changes have been tossed out or whittled
away in the intervening decades.
   The Legislature also needs to look at the possibility of "the public
having some generation assets under its control -- for example, the
hydroelectric assets PG&E now has up for sale," Keeley said.
   "PG&E's assets on Northern California rivers is the largest group of
hydroelectric assets under one ownership in the state," he said. "Public
ownership of these hydroelectric assets is preferable to private ownership
because those assets in public ownership would mean lower rates for
consumers."
   Whatever course the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state
lawmakers take, the stakes are undeniably high.
   "If this conflict is allowed to continue," Bowen wrote FERC Chairman James
Hoecker last month, ". . . then we have failed our duty to Californians."

California Power ShuffleHere is how California's electricity distribution
system is set up and what steps the regulatory body can take in times of
extreme need..ISO statsVolume: 164 billion kilowatt hours a year Size:
124,000 sq. miles, or 75 percent of state.Day-by-day shortage The ISO
forecasts electricity usage throughout the state and monitors actual peak
usage..Stages of emergencyThe stages of electrical power emergencies in
California:Stage 1: Declared when the state's operating reserves of energy
dip below 7 percent. All power consumers are asked to conserve
energy.Stage 2: Declared when operating reserves fall below 5 percent.
Customers who have gotten lower rates for agreeing to go off-line when a
power crunch hits are ordered to reduce or shut off their power.Stage 3:
Declared when operating reserves fall below 1.5 percent. Rotating
blackouts could result, with power to different areas temporarily cut
off..COMPANIES THAT OPERATE WITHIN THE ISO:Pacific Gas & ElectricSouthern
California EdisonSan Diego Gas & Electric.Independent System OperatorA
not-for-profit corporation that ensures a competitive market for
electricity and controls the integrity of the state's strained power
grid..Remedies for a Stage 3 alertThe ISO can order the state to conserve
power during a Stage 3 alert by:Asking large facilities, such as a mine or
water pump, to shut down for a day to lessen demand. .Depriving some areas
of power in order to maintain others by initiating rotating blackouts or
brownouts -- temporary sags in power..Source: California Independent

THE TECH SLUMP
Slowing growth in tech spending, not shrinkage, is what's in store. But that 
will be painful enough -- for the industry and the economy as a whole.

After midday Monday, for all readers:

Election 2000:
HOW BUSH WOULD LEAD
As the election process crawls to its seemingly inevitable conclusion, it 
looks like George W. will face a slowing economy, a divided Congress, and an 
uneasy nation. But don't judge W., who has a history of being underestimated, 
just yet.

THE BEST PRODUCTS OF 2000

that goes for $130,000, we've picked out the best of this year's new  stuff. 
Now you can't complain that you don't know what to get anyone for the 
holidays!

After three and a half years as CFO Enron Europe, Paul Chivers has decided to 
move on from the Global Finance Group and is considering commercial 
assignments within Enron both here in Europe and in Houston. Paul has made a 
significant contribution to Enron's European business in building a team that 
consistently delivers financing for our transactions. We wish him every 
success in the future.

Effective immediately, Anne Edgley will assume the position of CFO Europe. 
Please join us in welcoming her to this new role.

Thanks very much to Enron for the card and gift.  I made my donation to the 
Boys & Girls Club of the Columbia Area because my wife has served as a 
director of this organization since its inception about 5 years ago.  Thanks 
again, and happy holidays to Ken Lay and colleagues at Enron.

______________________________________________

Greetings Friends,

The election results in Florida have been certified in accordance with 
Florida state law and the rulings of the Florida Supreme Court, and Governor 
Bush and Secretary Cheney have won that state's 25 electoral votes.  It is 
now time to get on with the business of organizing a new administration.

In order to begin that task, we have filed articles of incorporation for the 
Bush/Cheney Presidential Transition Foundation, a non-profit corporation.  As 
past transition foundations have done, we are applying for 501(c)(4) status 
from the Internal Revenue Service.  Now we are asking for your help as our 
team moves forward with plans for an orderly transition process in the short 
period between now and inauguration day, January 20, 2001.

While the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended in 1988, 
specifically authorizes public funds for transitions, it also makes 
provisions for raising contributions from private sources to help defray 
transition-related expenses.  This has been done previously, most recently in 
1992.  We are now soliciting contributions from our most active supporters.  
Would you please visit our new transition website at 
www.bushcheneytransition.com and make a contribution on our secure server.

We have made the decision to accept contributions only from individuals.  No 
corporate or political action committee contributions will be accepted.  
Contributions may not exceed $5,000 per person or $10,000 per couple, and all 
contributors, in compliance with Governor Bush's position of full-disclosure 
of financial contributions, will be posted on the transition website on a 
real-time basis.  These contributions will not count against an individual's 
annual political contribution federal giving limit of $25,000.

The American voters have spoken, and we are moving forward to establish a 
government that will unify our country and make the common principles we 
share as Americans our first priority.

If you have questions, please contact the Transition Foundation's finance 
office at 512-344-3722.  All other transition inquiries should be directed to 
our office in McLean, VA at (703) 918-2900. Your support of the Bush/Cheney 
Presidential Transition Foundation is deeply appreciated.

Sincerely,


Donald L. Evans

Comments from US Supreme Court Justice Scalia

"One of the principal issues in the appeal we have accepted is precisely 
whether the votes that have been ordered to be counted are, under a 
reasonable interpretation of Florida law, 'legally cast vote[s].'  The 
counting of votes that are of questionable legality does in my view threaten 
irreparable harm to petitioner, and to the country, by casting a cloud upon 
what he claims to be the legitimacy of his election.  Count first, and rule 
upon legality afterwards, is not a recipe for producing election results that 
have the public acceptance democratic stability requires."

"Another issue in this case, moreover, is the propriety, indeed the 
constitutionality, of letting the standard for determination of voters' 
intent- dimpled chad, hanging chads, etc.- vary from county to county, as the 
Florida Supreme court opinion, as interpreted by the Circuit Court, permits.  
If petitioner [Bush] is correct that counting in this fashion is unlawful, 
permitting the count to proceed on that erroneous basis will prevent an 
accurate recount from being conducted on a proper basis later, since it is 
generally agreed that each manual recount produces a degradation of the 
ballots, which renders a subsequent recount inaccurate."

Comments from Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles T. Wells


DISSENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES J. WELLS
"I...believe that the majority's decision cannot withstand scrutiny which 
will certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."
Excerpt:
"I want to make it clear at the outset of my separate opinion that I do not 
question the good faith or honorable intentions of my colleagues in the 
majority. However, I could not more strongly disagree with their decision to 
reverse the trial court and prolong this judicial process. I also believe 
that the majority's decision cannot withstand the scrutiny which will 
certainly immediately follow under the United States Constitution."

"My succinct conclusion is that the majority's decision...has no foundation 
in the law of Florida as it existed on November 7, 2000, or at anytime until 
the issuance of this opinion. The majority returns the case to the circuit 
court for this partial recount of  under-votes on the basis of unknown or, at 
best, ambiguous standards with authority to obtain help from others, the 
credentials, qualifications, and objectivity of whom are totally unknown. 
That is but a first glance at the imponderable problems that the majority 
creates."

"This case has reached the point where finality must take precedence over 
continued judicial process. I agree with a quote from John Allen Paulos, a 
professor of mathematics at Temple University, when he wrote that, "[t]he 
margin of error in this election is far greater than the margin of victory, 
no matter who wins." Further judicial process will not change this 
self-evident fact and will only result in confusion and disorder. Justice 
Terrell and this Court wisely counseled against such a course of action 
sixty-four years ago. I would heed that sound advice and affirm Judge Sauls."

California Regulators Back Rate Increase For Utilities

* California regulators indicated yesterday that they are willing to
raise rates for electric utilities EIX and PCG,  following a review of their
finances
* Hearings to review utilities' financial status in hearings on Dec.
27 and 28
* KEY DATE:  January 4, when we expect they will vote to raise rates
* We see this action as positive for the utilities, because it reduces
the likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy, although further action is
required, in our view
* We also see it as positive for our Growth Energy companies.  Any
reduction in financial pressure on the utilities equates to reduced pressure
to re-regulate the wholesale power industry, in our view
* The results of the action were in line with our expectation; we
recommend investors buy the Growth Energy names on weakness.  In particular,
we highlight DYN, CPN, NRG, SOE and DUK.

Dear Louise and Greg:

Fortune magazine's September article about your--virtually
overnight--success building EnronOnline prompted me to contact you, mostly
because our company's (Everypath, Inc.) wireless technology could be the
perfect tool to help you move the EnronOnline marketplace into wireless by
offering trading anytime, anywhere, via any wireless devices (as we've done
for E*Trade, Fidelity, and others offering complex wireless transactions).

Very briefly, our company has quickly gained real traction in this space.
We were honored as a Smithsonian Laureate this year, named by Forbes among
the 25 Best of the Web in business to business, and recognized by CNet as
one of ten "wireless companies to watch."   Our partners include Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Andersen Consulting and Cap Gemini Ernst &
Young, as well as many others, and have already raised significant funding
from investors such as Robertson Stephens, Comdisco, Dain Rauscher Wessels,
Sevin Rosen, U.S Venture Partners, Andersen Consulting Ventures, Sun, and H
& Q.

If you see commodities trading moving soon into wireless,  just as you saw
(or influenced) the industry to move online, shouldn't Enron lead the way in
wireless trading too?  We would love the opportunity to talk to you about
helping you go wireless.

Let me know if I should follow-up with you or someone else in your group by
sending an email or calling at any of the numbers below.  I look forward to
hearing from you, and to coming home to Houston to speak with you further
about this (I practiced law in Houston for years with Weil, Gotshal &
Manges--over in the NationsBank building on Louisiana).

Sincerely, David Marcus

Here is a draft position report we talked about previously. We had delayed 
distribution because we were waiting for some important input on the Sithe 
contract.

The report attempts to view various assets and positions entirely on an 
economic basis, regardless of accounting treatment. Currently this is not 
exhaustive since the universe of economic exposure is significant but if 
useful we will spread the net. 

Here are the highlights:

Enron stock option plans: 

ENE is low and volatility is around 45 - 50%. We are working with Global 
Finance and Accounting on a hedging proposal.

J Block CRTA:

We have not factored in the impact of yesterday's House of Lords ruling on 
this contract.

Korea:

USD/KRW has gone from 1205 to 1368. Economic outlook is bleak. Enron's 
currency translation account (CTA) has gone from $19m Dr to $40m Dr since 
January.

Brazil:

Argentina's woes are not helping. USD/BRL is currently 2.17 from 1.95 in 
January. CTA has suffered $173m in losses and now stands at $663m Dr.




Thoughts and comments welcome.

Meet the head of
the leading firm
in our business

Imagine the opportunity!
 Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run=
=20
the
company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North=20
America.

 So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a=
=20
co-owner
assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or three.
To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with =
a
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower=01,s wares.
You do an IPO and take in about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO =
is
over and the quiet period it required.
But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your energy at the b=
est
price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get up front 30=20
Enron-trained
risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene=20
Lockhart,
most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before that presid=
ent
of BankAmerica=01,s Global Retail Bank with its consumer, commercial and sm=
all=20
business
banking services delivered through 3,000+ branches.
 Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.
      Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in=
=20
detail:

 *  How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is=
=20
the
heart of NewPower=01,s business plan?
 *  How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
 *  How he=01,s going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a mi=
llion
by the end of 2001.
 *  What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What=20
figure
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
 *  Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest=
=20
the
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated=
=20
retail
marketer in the US.
 *  How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
 *  What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
 *  What does he see as his biggest challenge?
 *  Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
 *  Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
 *  What=01,s the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
 *  Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bi=
ll,
what kind of margin can it make now?
 *  How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We=01,re actually in a very good=
=20
position
given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our favor ... "
 *  "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a=
=20
bill,
collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone else in=
=20
the
industry by several orders of magnitude."

We=01,d love to send you the two-story, detailed report on how the leading=

in our industry is going to get there and stay there.

Hi Liz

them.

Many thanks

Eric

I do NOT want to announce this when it happens.  We have been quietly 
avoiding how much activity we have done so far and many people assume that we 
already have done many...an assumption that helps us.  So please do NOT issue 
this.

Just met w/ Skilling and Whalley. 

Var for gas has temp increase of $15MM until next friday (12/15/2000).
Jeff is calling for an executive comm mtg to ask for an additional $40 MM of 
corp var until next wed (12/13/2000).

One issue is UK power will be over VAR everyday starting probably thurs or 
fri of this week, unless we increase them as well. (They sweep retail deals 
into book once a week on this day). This increase only needs to be $2-3- 
million.

Fasten seat belts and apply oxygen masks. 

Rick

	CheMatch.com continues auction growth
Dec 04, 2000 10:12 AM ET 
	HOUSTON, Dec. 4 (LocalBusiness.com) -- CheMatch.com said more than 95,000 
metric tons of chemicals were traded in November through its private auction 
system -- a volume equal to more than half of the total trades since the 
auction's inception last summer. 
	In a written statement, Ed Moody, CheMatch.com's vice president of auctions 
said the private auction system uses real-time pricing feedback and can be 
tailored to the needs of each user. 
	Since CheMatch.com started the private auctions, about 50 companies have 
traded more than 175,000 metric tons of products including chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products. The average value of completed transactions is 
about $800,000. 
	In addition to auctions, CheMatch.com also operates a commodity chemicals, 
polymers and fuel products exchange on which more than 1 million metric tons 
of product has been transacted. 
	CheMatch has recently completed a restructuring that included layoffs, and 
early last month it withdrew a planned initial public offering. 
	Clay Jeansonne, CheMatch.com spokesman, told LocalBusiness.com last week the 
company currently has 85 employees down from 93 and that CheMatch expects to 
bring in new funding from venture capital and technology companies by the end 
of the year. 
	Privately held CheMatch.com is an Internet-based marketplace for the buyers 
and sellers of bulk commodity chemicals, plastics and fuel products. Its 
investors currently include Battery Ventures, Bayer AG (NYSE: BAYZY), 
Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC), DuPont (NYSE: DD), GE (NYSE: GE) and 
Millennium Chemicals (NYSE: MCH).

o Online Marketing Firm iChoose Shuts Down

DALLAS -- iChoose, a developer of e-commerce marketing
systems, said it has shut down due to lack of funding.
In the past couple of months, the company has struggled
to stay alive by seeking out additional funding,
and even signed a letter of intent to be acquired.
That  acquisition fell through and the company said
it had no other choice than to close. iChoose was
unable to disclose the would-be-acquirer due to
legal restrictions. On its Web site, the company
posted a message with uninstall instructions for
its software and a final farewell to its customers.
iChoose was backed by Sevin Rosen.

Mark/Greg, 

Please confirm your interest and availability to set aside 30 minutes, or so 
Dec 6, 7 or 8, for me in Houston this week.

I am in a final phase of an expat re-assignment or relocation and would like 
to discuss with you:

Enron's pricing, structuring and position-taking capability for South America 
etc.,.. expected to be in place from the year 2000, at least in power in 
Brazil.

Failure/Successes and immediate opportunities in the Enron Brazil and South 
America core (gas, power) and multiple commodity commercial effort(s), 
including e-business/Networks issues.

Finance expertise  - the critical role that functional groups like Enron 
Metals' (Trade and Structure Finance Group) and the Global Markets 
Insurance/Global Risk groups will (need to) play in helping develop critical, 
internal Enron finance, risk assessment and mitigation expertise to support 
the competitiveness and viability of closing commercial transactions in South 
America and elsewhere

My priority to help form and be re-assigned to a "Bundle Products" 
Origination business unit  designed to initiate transactions which 
specifically and formally leverage synergies across Enron Business Units - to 
potentially include in Brazil, at least, power, pulp & paper, steel networks, 
crude and products, and insurance/global risk. 

Please find attatched files which detail some of my ideas for developing the 
core gas and power trading and origination efforts and including the Bundled 
Product unit.   The files were appropriately forwarded to Dave/John. 




I have also attatched my CV should you be interested to review my background 
and experience and  mention, as a reminder, that a meeting is critical in 
potentially determining the outcome of my expat re-assignment or re-location 
process,  needed to be concluded this month, Dec 2000.  

Thank you for any efforts extended in my behalf.

Please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue, which contains some 
typos.



Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL and the half bid-offer spread 
is $1 for simplicity, we take 5
 trades of short positions, the total MTM for that day is 
(-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$150,000 and total trading 
volume is 50,000 BBL short.  If per trade volume is 50,000 BBL, we take one 
trade, the total MTM is 
-5*50,000= -$250,000.   Thus the net difference between the two trading 
strategies is $10,000 for that
particular day.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by factor of 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change in millions.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

An outstanding year!

2000, of course. It was extraordinary, by any measure.

How many years can you name that start with a great hoax -- Y2K -- and end 
with a monumental hoot -- the world's greatest democracy can't get the hang 
of how to elect a President?

We're not the only mad conspiratorialist to divine that the Y2K scare was the 
brilliant handiwork of a cabal of top computer makers intent on sparking 
sales -- and what a wildly successful scheme it was.

Few, however, are privy to the knowledge that the massive snafu of election 
2000 was no improbable statistical fluke but the Machiavellian contrivance of 
Ross Perot exacting revenge for being denied his usual place on the ballot. 
Besides, it finally occurred to Ross that he wasn't going to be President, 
and that made him as mad as a plucked rooster: If he wasn't going to be 
President, by gum, nobody was going to be President!

Even though election 2000 demonstrated a small defect -- an inability to pick 
a winner (but remember, nothing's perfect) -- it did put to rest some nasty 
aspersions that have long been cast on the workings of this blessed republic. 
Most particularly, it buried once and for all the cynical notion that money 
can buy the Presidency. Both parties spent hundreds of millions of dollars 
trying to do just that -- and came up empty.

So let's not hear any more nonsense about the Presidency being for sale. It's 
now quite clear that the Presidency can't be bought; conceivably, though, it 
can be stolen.

What remains to be determined is which of the pretenders can pull off the 
theft. Mr. Bush would seem to enjoy a congenital advantage, since the 
governor of the state whose votes ultimately will prove decisive is his baby 
brother.

On the other hand, Al Gore has the overwhelming support and counsel of the 
trial lawyers. Trial lawyers, after all, make a profession of knowing how to 
get away with murder. So they should find figuring out how to snatch the 
Presidency mere child's play.

Not the least remarkable thing about this most remarkable year is that the 
Supreme Court seemingly has abandoned its long tradition of following the 
election returns in favor of helping to shape them. The good part is that 
there are nine of them-seven mostly old men and two women of a certain 
age-assuring a majority ruling, unless one recuses himself because he simply 
can't stand Florida.

Only in America in the year 2000.

-- As you're undoubtedly and possibly painfully aware, 2000 is already 
memorable in Wall Street as the year the air began to whoosh out of the 
monster stock-market bubble and, after many a frustrating try, the year the 
bears finally ate Goldilocks.

In fact, unless such portents as mounting claims for unemployment insurance 
and the latest downbeat readings on business from the purchasing managers are 
completely misleading, 2000 will go down as the beginning of the end of the 
most salutary and long-lived economic boom to grace this nation (and probably 
any other).

These are, admittedly, negative distinctions. But if you're a year and want 
to be famous, you can't be picky: No one harks back to 1929 because it was a 
great year for butterflies.

Nasdaq unarguably has turned in a once-in-a-lifetime performance this year. 
Never before has a stock-market index caused as much pain in so short a time 
as did Nasdaq in its breathtaking (and wealth-evaporating) 50% drop from its 
March high to its close last Thursday. What's more, it has a full month to 
better (worsen?) that fantastic feat.

Nor does the plunge in the index -- formidable as it is -- do full justice to 
the awesome decline. A much more graphic picture is painted by the slides in 
individual issues. Here, we're indebted to a sometime correspondent named 
Howard Boyet, who sent us a list of 90 of the most gruesome casualties. Alas, 
space -- and solicitude for those readers of an especially delicate 
disposition -- prevent us from listing the entire wretched roster. But a 
sampling will give you the flavor.

For instance, Foundry Networks, which peaked at 212, was last seen at around 
41. Harmonic has fallen from 158 to 7-plus. Internet Capital from 212 to 6. 
FreeMarkets, from 370 to 29.50 (not quite free yet, but it's getting there). 
VA Linux, from 320 to 8. Red Hat, 151 to 6. Inktomi, 241 to 24. DoubleClick, 
135 to 13. Akamai, 346 to 27. Next Level, 202 to 11 (we dread to contemplate 
the stock's next level). MicroStrategy, 333 to 12 (might be something wrong 
with the strategy). Ask Jeeves, 144 to 10 (if it's all the same, we'd rather 
not ask him). And on and drearily on.

So if you own stocks like Dell Computer (60 to 18) or Gateway (81 to 19) or 
Texas Instruments (100 to 37) or Oracle (46 to 26), you can take some comfort 
in the knowledge that you could have owned any of the above or the likes of 
Razorfish (57 to 3), Novell (44 to 6) or Covad (67 to 2).

These exercises are now commonplace, and journalistically, we suppose, 
they're the equivalent of a circus freak show. But they do, as Mr. Boyet 
suggests, provide a more vivid and even more accurate description of the 
damage wrought.

What we've found most intriguing is that, until now, all this blood in the 
Street has evoked very little public outcry. We've experienced a kind of 
cruel and vast but silent mugging. Magazines like Time and Newsweek haven't 
done their usual heavy-breathing treatments, nor have most newspapers, 
including the New York Times, made a front-page fuss about the decline and 
fall of Nasdaq. Nor are the networks running their usual inane specials.

Moreover, until quite recently, mutual-fund shareholders have placidly 
watched their wealth withering. No crowds gathering in front of fund 
headquarters and, more tellingly, no rush to redeem their holdings.

There are several possible explanations for this rather astonishing 
diffidence on the part of the financially wounded and the absence of hysteria 
in the press, both the electronic version and the genuine item. The 
distraction of the election that never ends. The fact that most everyone who 
wants one still has a job and a relatively high comfort level. Whatever the 
cause or combination of causes, that we're in a bear market, and a vicious 
one, doesn't seem to have sunk in yet.

Until it does and until fear stalks the Street and an ugly grizzly makes the 
cover of Time, if you run into anyone claiming to espy a bottom, take him 
firmly by the hand and guide him to the nearest ophthalmologist.

-- That chart adorning this page depicts another reason why there's lots of 
room still on the downside. (See accompanying illustration -- Barron's Dec. 
4, 2000) It comes to us courtesy of George Gilman, the savvy and talented 
producer of the Business Picture, a wonderful quarterly compilation of charts 
and info on the economy and the markets.

The last official number for the Nasdaq P/E, he reports, was 139.1 for 
October, but he reckons the figure fell to somewhere around 107 by the end of 
November.

As George comments: "Even after the 48.5% decline from the March 10 peak of 
5048.62 to Thursday's close of 2597.93, the P/E on Nasdaq is incredibly high."

And that's the point. The multiple wouldn't be cheap at half its current 
level. Nor would it shock us if, eventually, Nasdaq and its P/E fell another 
50%.

-- While we're convinced we're in the early stages of a secular bear market, 
we know there'll be blips in this descent just as there were dips in the late 
great bull market.

In truth, we're surprised we haven't had a halfway decent rebound yet. 
Certainly, we're overdue for one. Consider this a heads-up on what might 
trigger a bounce (apart from a miraculous resolution to the election snarl).

Next Tuesday, Alan Greenspan is slated to deliver the keynote address to a 
gathering of commmunity bankers in New York City (which is not overrun by 
community banks but is a great place to visit). We haven't a clue as to what 
he intends to say, and it might well be nothing intelligible.

But should Mr. G make a sly reference to the economy and monetary policy and 
hint that maybe the Fed is poised to shift from tight to neutralthat just 
could rouse spirits in Wall Street enough to ignite a fairly brisk -- if 
relatively brief -- move up.

-- John Liscio died last week. John was our colleague at Barron's for roughly 
a half-dozen years in the late 'Eighties and early 'Nineties, and not a day 
went by that he didn't light up the place.

He was vibrant and funny, outrageous and irreverent, extraordinarily 
intelligent. He was brash and tough and had an insatiable appetite for 
mischief. Yet he was also warmly affectionate, shirt-off-his-back generous 
and, oddly, possessed of a touching ingenuousness.

John had an expansive mind that ranged restlessly and relentlessly over just 
about every subject known to literate and inquiring man and a few that only 
his special imagination provided entry to. He was a baseball nut, a 
cantankerous pitcher for and captain of Barron's softball team and a demon 
participant in the Fantasy League, where grown men play at being 
owner-managers of major-league teams. In fact, he was the commissioner of his 
league (in which role, we can only surmise, he visited great anguish on his 
fellow Fantasy Leaguers).

As a writer, John was exceptional. He brought to economics and markets a 
knowledge not only of those murky subjects but also of the wide world; a 
gifted and fluent pen and a sense of humor that could be -- inevitably was -- 
deliciously wicked. He would leap with positive glee on some unfortunate with 
a tempting name. There was a chap named LaWare at the Fed, for example, whom 
John inevitably and with some purpose called UnaWare. Morgan Stanley 
economist Stephen Roach was rarely mentioned by John but as the proprietor of 
the Roach Motel, where the facts check in but don't check out.

He was a brilliant journalist, both at Barron's and at U.S. News, and, 
against all advice and odds, launched an economic newsletter, the Liscio 
Report, which became a roaring success. The reason was simply that John had 
more wit in one pinky and more insight in the other than any dozen economists.

John, who was spunk personified, showed unbelievable courage as he battled 
his last illness. When we visited him in his hospital room and told him 
joshingly he looked like hell, he grinned that indomitable grin of his and 
launched into a couple of hours of dissertation on the state of the world, 
excitedly detailing his plans for the future.

He was the most indomitable person we've ever met. All of us here at Barron's 
and, for that matter, anyone lucky enough to have known him, will miss him 
terribly.

Acta Announces Partnership With i2; i2 Customers Can Now Choose Acta's 
Rapid-to-Implement Data Integration Products to Collaborate Intelligently 
Across the Supply Chain

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 11, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, today announced a 
technology partnership with i2 Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:ITWO), the leading 
provider of marketplace solutions. 
The partnership enables i2's TradeMatrix(TM) customers to choose Acta's data 
platform, which is designed to package and speed the delivery of the 
back-office data essential for selling, buying and collaborating online. Acta 
will develop a number of data cache solutions (Acta eCaches(TM)) to provide 
rapidly deployable, pre-packaged data content and connectivity to the 
back-office systems that fuel TradeMatrix applications. 
i2's TradeMatrix allows businesses to create both private and public 
marketplaces, while improving the efficiencies of all participants with 
content and solutions to support decision optimization for key functions 
including design, buy, plan, sell, fulfill and service. The Acta eCaches for 
TradeMatrix will enable businesses to share key back-office data with their 
customers and trading partners and provide rapid-to-implement solutions for 
integrating key B2B data from operational systems across the entire extended 
enterprise. 
Industry leaders and analysts have recognized the need for packaged solutions 
for B2B data integration -- the linchpin in a rapidly growing number of B2B 
initiatives. 
"B2B data integration is rapidly emerging as a 'must-have' technology for all 
companies who do business online. As a leader in B2B data integration and 
caching, Acta enables i2's TradeMatrix customers to grant rapid access to 
detailed and accurate data from enterprise systems," said Acta CEO Carol 
Mills Baldwin. "Now TradeMatrix customers will be able to combine i2's 
industry leading technology with the most rapid data integration solution, 
essential for conducting business collaboration online." 
The Acta/i2 partnership provides further validation that B2B data caching is 
emerging as an important new category in B2B integration. Unlike other B2B 
integration solutions -- such as application integration and process 
integration -- Acta focuses on data integration as an essential component for 
allowing companies to do business online, either through direct commerce 
sites or in marketplaces. The Acta platform consists of ActaWorks 
RealTime(TM), an award-winning data movement-and-management server, and 
eCaches(TM), a suite of packaged data caches that speed the delivery of 
back-office data in specific subject areas of eCommerce and business 
intelligence.

Summary:

* U.S. President George W. Bush unveiled his National Energy Policy
today.  In our report we list the recommendations made by the National
Energy Policy Development Group (NEPD) as they pertain to Renewable and
Alternative Energy.  In addition, following each recommendation, we provide
our views on the potential impacts on specific CSFB covered companies
(AstroPower - APWR, Ballard Power Systems - BLDP, Capstone Turbine - CPST,
FuelCell Energy - FCEL, Proton Energy Systems - PRTN) in the Energy
Technology sector.
* We would note that many of the recommendations instruct certain
departments or individuals to conduct further research on various topics and
to report back to the President at a later date.  Our view is that many were
included as a counter point to more contentious issues and may receive
somewhat limited action from the Administration.
* Overall, we are not changing our estimates or recommendations on any
of our companies at this point in time.  The proposed solar tax credit
when/if passed will cause us to review our forecasts for AstroPower.  We are
not forecasting incremental unit volume of production given the capacity
constraint of the company, although residential installations tend to have a
higher revenue per watt and higher margins than non-residential markets and
therefore could result in higher EPS contribution.

please include them also.

Thanks.

Mr. Lay,

First - congratulations on your year 2000 to date. From what I have
researched, Enron is an incredible organization of products, services and
people.

I represent MobileStar - the worlds largest public Wireless Lan company.
Based in Dallas, and private at this time - we have built and will continue
to build a WIFI IEEE 802.11b lan network in public places such as hotels,
airports, airline clubs and retail/coffee house type places where mobile
users go, eat, move, meet and sleep.  You will find us today in many
Marriotts, Hiltons, Sheratons and American Airline Admiral club rooms-
offering unteathered T-1 speed connectivity to a company lan or the
internet.

We are soon to launch Hong Kong Int Airport and the London airports as well.
We also have a confidential network partner/s in the works to be announced
in the next 30 days that will take our public network to over 5000 locations
in the next 2 years. You will be interested I assure you.

I feel that not only is MobileStar a service that could benefit your mobile
global staff that travels both domestically, locally and internationally,
but also a partner tie in terms of content delivery, possible backbone
partnerships and video/Blockbuster delivery to a MobileStar subscribers
handheld, Ipaq computer or laptop.

I would very much like the opportunity to meet with both your IT team whom
investigates wireless applications and services for your personnel as well
as a member of your Broadband Development team.

Also - I will offer you a FREE trial subscription to our network for  your
travels.

I thank you for your time.

PS - We are heading into Series C funding..........

Regards,

Kevin

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* The three-pack of Capstone microturbines capable of generating 90kW
of electricity has surpassed 6,000 hours (9 months) of non-stop operation at
a PanCanadian Petroleum oilfield in Alberta.  Not only has the units
achieved this length of operation, but they have done so at maximum output
with 100% availability.  Owing to their success with these units,
PanCanadian recently placed another three-pack of Capstone microturbines at
their Pelican Lake facility.
* Following the announcement that the exclusive joint development
agreement for fuel processor technology between UOP and Avista Labs
(subsidiary of Avista Corporation) would expire and not be renewed, UOP
intends to offer this fuel processor technology on a non-exclusive basis to
various fuel cell developers.
* Bergerat Monnoyeur Travaux Publics (BME), a Caterpillar dealer in
France, has ordered 51 Active Power flywheels (CleanSource(tm) DC) valued at
$1.4 million.  The units will be used to protect a 10 MW wafer fab facility
owned by STMicroelectronics in that country.

Computerworld Honors Acta Technology in Annual 'Top 100 Emerging Companies to 
Watch'; Industry Publication Recognizes Leader in B2B Data Integration
? 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 4, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., 
the leader in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, has been selected 
as one of Computerworld's "Top 100 Emerging Companies to Watch," the 
magazine's annual review of new leaders in high technology. The magazine has 
selected Acta as a winner in the highly-competitive eCommerce category, which 
includes other leading B2B software companies such as Blue Martini (Nasdaq: 
BLUE), Saga Software (NYSE: AGS), and Ventro (Nasdaq: VNTR). 
"We are honored to be included in this year's list of emerging companies," 
said Acta CEO Carol Mills Baldwin. "B2B data integration is emerging as a 
must-have technology for businesses around the globe. Recognition for this 
technology in Computerworld is further validation of the category we have 
created." 
B2B data integration resolves one of the principle issues in eBusiness today: 
that back-office systems were not designed to meet the data demands of B2B 
eCommerce and analytic solutions. Those demands include speed, scalability, 
and access to both the real-time and historical data locked away in multiple 
back-office systems. By staging real-time and historical data from multiple 
systems in data caches, the Acta eCommerce Data Platform allows companies to 
deliver the data that is needed, when it is needed, both inside and outside 
the enterprise. 
Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B (cumulative) 
by 2005-driven by the need to provide information-rich data to partners, 
suppliers and customers for collaborative computing. 
With over 160 customers worldwide, Acta is well-poised to continue leading 
the growing B2B data integration market. In the past year, Acta has also won 
honors from Upside Magazine (Hot 100 private companies), DM Review (Winner, 
World Class Solutions) eWeek (Best Practices Award-B2B Category, Finalist), 
and Intelligent Enterprise (RealWare Awards-B2B Category, Finalist).

CALIFORNIA  SITUATION CLARITY IMPROVING; MOST LIKELY OUTCOME FAVORABLE FOR
ALL
* While we do not expect a direct rate increase or removal of the rate
freeze for EIX or PCG out of the California Public Utility Commission
meeting today, we are encouraged by the conciliatory tone of recent
comments.
* In our view, acerbic rhetoric has finally given way to pragmatic
reconciliation and it now appears that California utilities are on the path
towards effectively receiving the rate increases they require to remain
solvent.
* We believe this has implications not only for the health of the
affected utilities, but also for the Growth Energy Merchants and Competitive
Generators.
* While the credit risk associated with utilities' power market
purchases have not been solved yet, the credit risk in the California market
has eased somewhat.
* While trading may be choppy as the final California remedy is
hammered out, we recommend the purchase of the Growth Energy names
throughout any near-term weakness possible as a result of the process.
* Decision expected today at 4:00 PM EST.

CONGRATULATIONS ON THE CLOSURE OF THE ALAMAC/AIG TRANSACTION!! Fantastic 
effort and job well done from beginning to end! I don't remember the other 
folks involved on your deal team but I do know this deal would not have 
happened had it not been for you three! I remember when we started this last 
July (remember the $1 DASH ?!), the hurdles that kept popping up (oh, just a 
little bankruptcy proceeding), and the s-l-i-c-k structuring of the entire 
transaction. Bought if for $3.5 million, sold it for $26 million, marked an 
incremental $5 million on a coal contract, and still have the right to 
"broker" another sale and keep 90% of the proceeds ( another $10+ million)!! 
Pretty awesome.

This was really a great job by all! Let me know the date of the celebration 
dinner!

Subject: HOLIDAY PARTY THANKS

I wanted to thank everyone involved for the beautiful bouquet of flowers that 
I received today.  It was a pleasure working with all of you on the holiday 
party at Enron Field.  I appreciate the executives 'stepping up to the plate' 
(so to speak) when they were asked to go out on the field.  You could tell by 
the roar from the audience that they thoroughly enjoyed the banter!!  I would 
also like to thank Nicki Daw, Kim Hillis, Cathy Phillips, Jennifer Burns, Sue 
Ford, Marsha Schiller, Liz Taylor and Kay Chapman for all their efforts and 
support during the planning of this event. 

My greatest reward is knowing that everyone enjoyed the festivities.  Thanks 
again and I wish all of you a very joyous holiday season!!

Greg and John,

I found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of 
trades ( keeping the 
total volume per day constant), we can be more profitable.  This is partially 
because in a trending market
we lose less money by following the market more closely. For example, suppose 
market move from
$30 to $35. If per trade volume is 10,000 BBL, we take 6 trades of short 
positions, the total MTM for that
day is (-5-4-3-2-1)*10,000=-$90,000 and total trading volume is 60,000 BBL.
 If per trade volume is 60,000 BBL, we take one trade, the total MTM is 
-5*60,000= -$300,000.

Therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the 
number of trades, we can be more
profitable as a market maker.  

I rerun a scenario that Stinson sent to you on Dec. 27 where he used per 
trade volume of 30,000 BBL.
I reduce the number of trade to 10,000 while increasing the number of trades 
by 3.  Almost in all
cases, I saw increased profitability.  See the colume marked "Change" for 
dollar amount change.

Please let Stinson or me know your thoughts on this.

Regards,

Zimin Lu

Subject: EnronOnline's Wireless offering


Dear Louise and Greg:

Fortune magazine's September article about your--virtually
overnight--success building EnronOnline prompted me to contact you, mostly
because our company's (Everypath, Inc.) wireless technology could be the
perfect tool to help you move the EnronOnline marketplace into wireless by
offering trading anytime, anywhere, via any wireless devices (as we've done
for E*Trade, Fidelity, and others offering complex wireless transactions).

Very briefly, our company has quickly gained real traction in this space.
We were honored as a Smithsonian Laureate this year, named by Forbes among
the 25 Best of the Web in business to business, and recognized by CNet as
one of ten "wireless companies to watch."   Our partners include Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Andersen Consulting and Cap Gemini Ernst &
Young, as well as many others, and have already raised significant funding
from investors such as Robertson Stephens, Comdisco, Dain Rauscher Wessels,
Sevin Rosen, U.S Venture Partners, Andersen Consulting Ventures, Sun, and H
& Q.

If you see commodities trading moving soon into wireless,  just as you saw
(or influenced) the industry to move online, shouldn't Enron lead the way in
wireless trading too?  We would love the opportunity to talk to you about
helping you go wireless.

Let me know if I should follow-up with you or someone else in your group by
sending an email or calling at any of the numbers below.  I look forward to
hearing from you, and to coming home to Houston to speak with you further
about this (I practiced law in Houston for years with Weil, Gotshal &
Manges--over in the NationsBank building on Louisiana).

Sincerely, David Marcus

On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communicatio=
n,=20
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide=20
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions tha=
t=20
are underway to restructure  Enron=01,s operations in South America.  The b=
asic=20
organizational framework has been set.=20

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new=
=20
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and=
=20
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting=
=20
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility=
;=20
however, Orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,=20
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe=01,s focus =
will=20
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal=
l=20
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CE=
O=20
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding=20
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in=
=20
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=
=20
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil a=
nd=20
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our=
=20
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being=20
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset=
s=20
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20
America will be organized around the highly successful North American netwo=
rk=20
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical=20
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu=
e=20
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and=
=20
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report =
to=20
Joe and Orlando:
=20
The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will=
 =20
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine=
=20
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

? Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=
=20
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital=20
capabilities;
? Providing those products and services across South America and across the=
=20
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=
=20
opportunity;
? Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move=
=20
quickly to capitalize;
? Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the=20
overall risk of the organization;
? Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South Ameri=
ca=20
consistent with this strategy, and
? Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and de=
al=20
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w=
ho=20
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=
=20
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio=
n,=20
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.=20

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The=
=20
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=
=20
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale=
s=20
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel=
y=20
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible=
=20
for managing Enron South America=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=
=20
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americ=
as=20
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American=20
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we=
=20
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero. =
=20

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organizati=
on=20
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support=20
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea=
m=20
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in=20
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business=20
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=
=20
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston=20
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=
=20
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will=20
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=
=20
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate=
,=20
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a=20
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will=20
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During th=
is=20
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator=
y=20
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick=20
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage t=
he=20
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his=20
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo wi=
ll=20
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be=20
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=
=20
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and=
=20
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America=01,s legal=
=20
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron=20
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information=20
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration wil=
l=20
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=
=20
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting=20
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron=
=20
Wholesale Services =01) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale=
=20
Services =01) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and=20
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our=20
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new=20
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the=20
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly=20
affected will be notified shortly.
=20
Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its=20
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we ar=
e=20
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron=01,s core capabilities and create=20
shareholder value.

Gentlemen:
I good friend at Sun suggested me to contact  all of you at Enron  in
regard to the direction of my current searching campaign as  I have made
the decision to leave my post as Vice President and General Manager of
Network Associates Latin America and Caribbean. It is of my understanding
that Enron is undergoing a huge  internal transformation to become one of
the leading E-Commerce players worldwide.

Network Associates is the leading and independent provider   of total
security software solutions to monitor and protect telecommunications,
E-Commerce and internet applications worldwide. Since I was given the
mission to start  the region in 1996 I have been instrumental to
increase sales from 2M to 35M US in 4 years. I have been in charge of
supervising and managing over 100 employees across the region and the US
with complete P&L responsibilities.

Previous to join NAI, I worked  for Seagate where I had the
responsibilitity to set up the whole  supply chain in South Florida and
and across the region resulting in a sales increase from 25M to 125M US
in 4 years. With over 20 years of experience selling and transfering
technology internationally I feel proud of my record and accomplishments.


Should any of you be interested in talking to me about any opportunity
within any of your organizations, please do not hesitate to call me at
954-452-0664. Thank you in advance for your positive consideration. Best
regards, Herbert Arturo Molina

Greg, still nothing firm about that, both utilities are screaming for relief. 
Gov Davis refered to 13 companies as the Dirty 13 for not selling into CA, 
Enron was one. That was off Wire this morning. FERC intervened yesterday. 
What is long term affect? Most utilities are concerned still problem. Ben

PCG, Moody's is considering it. The news wire said PG&E(PCG) is going to be
at 6 Billion by the end of December in the whole. More should be available

Attached is the draft press release for Cinergy's purchase of the Brownsville 
and Caledonia peakers.  They are routing it to their Treasury department for 
final review with respect to the opinion of their ratings agency.  If 
everyone at Cinergy signs off, they plan to release this morning.  They will 
call me prior to release.

If you have any changes, please contact me ASAP.  Thanks.

Dear Friends,

President-elect Bush has brought together an excellent group to serve as his
Cabinet.  His nominees are a diverse, experienced, and strong group.  They
will help enact his agenda, change the tone in Washington and make us proud.

Your help is needed to get these outstanding men and women confirmed by the
United States Senate.  Some of President-elect Bush's nominees are being
unfairly attacked by outside groups and the Senate needs to hear that from
you.

One of the first Senate hearings will be Tuesday for Senator John Ashcroft,
President-elect Bush's choice for Attorney General.

The hallmark of Senator Ashcroft's long history of public service has been
integrity.  As Attorney General, he will uphold the law and make the
Department of Justice an institution all Americans can be proud of.

He brings a unique record of service to this challenge.  He was twice
elected Missouri's Attorney General, serving with both Republican and
Democrat Governors.  He was elected Governor of Missouri, an important swing
state, and then reelected with 64% of the vote.  John then was elected to
the U.S. Senate, where he just finished a six-year term.  No other Attorney
General has ever had this wealth of experience.

John has a long history of strong leadership on important issues, including:

- Won widespread acclaim for his effectiveness in running the Missouri
Attorney General's office by attracting strong men and women to serve his
state and strictly upholding the law
- As Senator, co-Sponsored the Violence Against Women Act
- As Governor, signed Missouri's first Hate-Crimes Bill and fought to
protect victims' rights
- Balanced the State Budget all eight years As Governor
- Made Education Reform a priority as Governor
- Toughened penalties for crimes committed with a Gun
- Worked To protect children at school, strengthen classroom safety
- Voted For background checks at pawn shops
- Was Endorsed By Missouri Law Enforcement Agencies
- Supported 26 of 28 African-Americans nominated to the Federal bench
- Was commended as Governor by one of the oldest Black Bar Associations for
his record of appointing minorities
- Appointed many African-Americans to Missouri's courts
- Was one of the first Governors to sign a law creating a Martin Luther King
holiday
- Created an award honoring George Washington Carver's Accomplishments,
saved Lincoln College, an historic Black college founded by African-American
veterans of the Civil War.

Some groups are attacking Ashcroft for opposing the nomination of Judge
Ronnie White to a lifetime appointment as a Federal judge. Every Republican
Senator opposed White's confirmation, in part, because he urged a lower
legal standard for a man convicted of first-degree murder 4 times (including
the first degree murder of three police officers).

Some groups charge Ashcroft will not uphold abortion laws with which he
disagrees.  This is wrong and simply an attempt to undermine the new
Administration.  Ashcroft understands the job of the Attorney General is to
carry out the letter of the law.   He will restore the rule of law to the
Justice Department and run a highly professional department.

Please do two things.

First, let your Senator know you strongly support a fair confirmation
process for John Ashcroft.

Go to http://www.senate.gov/senators/senator_by_state.cfm to find the
contact information for the Senators from your state.

Second, let the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee know you support
John Ashcroft's confirmation.  The committee begins its hearings Tuesday.
Its members are: http://www.senate.gov/~judiciary/members.htm

D(DE) Biden Jr, Joseph, (202) 224-5042, senator@biden.senate.gov

R(IA) Grassley, Chuck,, (202) 224-3744, http://grassley.senate.gov/webform.htm
R(UT) Hatch, Orrin, (202) 224-5251, senator_hatch@hatch.senate.gov
D(MA) Kennedy, Edward, (202) 224-4543, senator@kennedy.senate.gov
D(WI) Kohl, Herb, (202) 224-5653, senator_kohl@kohl.senate.gov

R(SC) Thurmond, Strom, (202) 224-5972, senator@thurmond.senate.gov
D(NJ) Torricelli, Robert, (202) 224-3224 
senator_torricelli@torricelli.senate.gov

Finally, two recent comments from current United States Senators:

Senator Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) had this to say about the Ashcroft
nomination:

"'I think it represents a very good choice'. . . the only things people want
in an attorney general are 'good management, sound judgment and high
integrity.  They're not easy to find in one individual, but I think John
Ashcroft has all of them.'"  "I certainly assume I will be voting for
him."  - Sen. Robert Torricelli (D-NJ) (David Kocieniewski, "Staunch Democrat
Eases Up on Opposition," The New York Times, January 6, 2001; Audrey Hudson,
"Democrats Set For Ashcroft's Confirmation," The Washington Times, January
4, 2001) (emphasis added)

Senator Kent Conrad (D-ND) Commended Ashcroft.

"I rise to pay tribute to Senator John Ashcroft as he prepares to leave the
Senate. . . . Senator Ashcroft has been a man of his word who served his
state and his country with distinction.  I join my colleagues on both sides
of the aisle in wishing him well in his future endeavors."  (Congressional
Record, December 15, 2000)

Thank you.

(Please forward this message to friends, family and co-workers and ask them
to show their support for President-elect Bush by asking their U.S. Senators
to support the confirmation of John Ashcroft)

The EES VaR for today is $14.0 million, up from $11.1 million yesterday, due 
to the short positions added to the Power West portfolio.  The VaR will 
decrease once the short positions associated with the University of 
California facilities are removed.

Enform expands Sun Micro partnership
HOUSTON, Dec. 15 (LocalBusiness.com) -- Enform technology, a high-tech 
consultant, said it has expanded the company's strategic partnership with Sun 
Microsystems Inc. Privately held Enform said Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sun 
Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is letting the company employ its integrator 
technology called iForce eIntegrators, for use in creating Web applications 
and building back-end systems that connect to the site. Sun will help Enform 
build its service offerings and create custom consulting services, which will 
be jointly marketed.  How much more business this will bring to Enform is not 
clear, and company officials today were not available to discuss the deal. 
Enform, which is run by John McNevin, a former partner at Ernst & Young, has 
grown quickly in its three-year existence. The Houston company helps 
businesses reinvent themselves by upgrading their systems or finding new 
technologies they need to remain competitive. Since its inception, Enform has 
apparently been profitable. It hasn't needed any venture capital to operate. 
The company has about 200 employees, with branch offices in Dallas and 
Austin, and expects to post sales of about $21 million this year. Enform 
recently told LocalBusiness.com that it expected to log about $100 million in 
sales next year, if the economy holds. Its client list includes Microsoft 
Corp., Engage Energy and Continental Airlines.

Hi John,

I assume you spoke with Nigel following your voicemail on Friday and he has 
brought you up to date.

We are doing everything we can to make fix this problem, and we are trying to 
ensure everyone is in the loop.

The problem looks to be a software bug somewhere in the Cisco operating 
environment. This has been escalated to Cicso's highest priority and we have 
had up to 6 Cisco engineers working on the problem. We have also flown in one 
on the Houston Netwrok team to assist. The problem we have is that the two 
core 6500 routers, which are at the hub of the network will run along 
perfectly at about 7% utilization, then, for an as yet undetermined reason 
they suddenly jump to 99% and start thrashing, dropping network connectivity. 

The catch 22 we have is that when the system goes down, the Cicso guys need 
time to capture diagnostic information, but of course we just need to get it 
up again straight away.

The team have systematically gone though each hardware component and each 
software component to ensure all are working, all are at the latest cisco 
recomended release level and all are required. Those not needed are removed 
to ensure the 'simplest' environment possible.

The bottom line is that we still haven't solved the problem, but are doing 
everything in our power to resolve it ASAP.

Regards
MRP

fyi, we have been working on a network redesign since before these problems 
start which will distribute the network across more Core routers, (in effect 
seperate networks). This design is the same as that proposed for the new 
Houston building. Whatever design is in place, however, we can never rule out 
a problem due to faulty software such as this.

Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is 
normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried 
a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community 
Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each 
recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the 
United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity, 
the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is 
receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you.

I have received two other thank you notes for the Charitygifts.  Upon 
redemption, there is a place for recipients to send a thank you via email and 
currently I am set up as the person to receive them.  Is that ok?  I don't 
mind and can forward them to you as I get them or save them and get them to 
you all at once.  It's great feedback and I think Ken would enjoy seeing 
their responses.  It seems as though people are enjoying getting them and 
being able to choose one of their favorite charities.  Let me know what you 
think.  I am also drafting a letter to go to DePelchin letting them know that 
we are doing this.  Would you like for it to come from Ken?  Thanks, Kathy

Kathy,
Eileen and I were most pleased to have the opportunity to donate to Southern 
Tier (NY) Hospice Corporation via the Charity Gift Card that Enron Executive 
Committee sent us.  Enron displays uncommon leadership in humanitarian 
activities as well as the business world.  Our thanks go to Ken and the 
Executive Committee.
Very truly yours,
Buddy and Eileen Leech

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Dave and John

The EES VaR for today is $16.9 million, up from $15.6 million, due primarily 
to additional short positions added to the Power West portfolio.  The short 
positions associated with the Univerisity of California facilities are 
expected to be removed early this week, which should decrease VaR.

ILA: Initiating Coverage of a Pure-Play Energy Merchant

* We initiate coverage of Aquila, Inc. with a 1H (Buy, High Risk)
rating and a 12-month price target of $44.
* Aquila is a pure-play Energy Merchant, leveraging their strong
trading and risk management skills in the rapidly growing energy commodity
markets.  Aquila was an early mover into these deregulating markets, and has
shown strong traction over recent years, which we believe is sustainable
long-term.
* We project a 20-25% growth rate for ILA driven by our robust outlook
for wholesale energy and the potential for successful expansion into new
commodities and geographies.
* At a 2002 0.7x P/E-to-growth (PEG) ratio, ILA is trading at a
significant discount to their Energy Merchant peer average of 1.0x. Based on
its strong track record and potential for industry-leading earnings growth,
we place a PEG value on ILA of 1.0x 2002 earnings, leading to our $44 price
target.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Energy Co-opportunity (ECO) and Capstone have entered into a
contractual relationship whereby ECO will be a preferred provider of and
will offer Capstone's 30kW microturbine unit to the electric cooperative
industry.  The contract also calls for the purchase of 76 units, which ECO
believes will sell rapidly given the interest indicated by its customers.
* Dublin, Ireland-based power developer Eirtricity is considering the
development of what would be the world's largest wind farm.  The 500 MW wind
farm would see a combination of land and offshore-based wind turbines,
likely in County Wicklow.
* Calpine c*Power, a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation, and AFS
Trinity have entered into a strategic partnership that will see Calpine
c*Power market AFS' flywheel products as a component of its Reliable Power
Systems that are designed to serve datacom ports.

Greg -- 

Thanks again for really lighting them up last night.  Being the best guy in 
11 years ain't bad.  It was fun for me to get to know you and look forward to 
working together.

Vance

p.s.  Your restaurant list has my wife looking to expedite the finding of a

The EES VaR for today is $11.1 million, up from yesterday's VaR of $8.2 
million, due to the additional short positions added at NP and SP.   The VaR 
will decrease once the short positions associated with the University of 
California facilities are removed.

Greg

I was talking with George Wasaff yesterday and he recommended I touch base 
with you in an effort to identify potential Enron interest in acquiring 
WaterDesk assets.

WaterDesk Corp.  was incubated by Azurix  to provide participants in the 
global water industry with a global, single-source, collaborative, 
business-to-business network to efficiently source, transact and manage, 
information, products and services.  We are currently involved in a private 
placement process that does portend some significant possibility for success 
but has not had anyone circle an offer yet.  Time is of the essence.  Given 
current market and industry realities, our priorities have changed in an 
effort to maximize near term opportunity for success. Specifically, in 
addition to offering investors the opportunity to invest in a public 
marketplace solution, we are pursuing other avenues, such as private 
marketplace or buy-side procurement solutions (which seem to be more 
palatable).  We are also broadening our opportunity set by seeking potential 
solutions outside the water industry. Feedback from the various and numerous 
entities that have performed due diligence on WaterDesk  indicate that its 
assets are well suited for any of these alternative solutions.

KEY ELEMENTS OF VALUE:  a qualified and experienced team; intellectual 
property; and, a secure, integrated and operational platform.  

Bottom Line: I have committed to John Garrison that we will deliver some form 
of success by February or we should "pull the plug".  It would be a pity to 
waste such valuable assets (human and physical).  I would like to meet with 
your or your designated representative(s) as soon as possible to determine 
what fit, if any, there might be with Enron endeavors, current or future.  

The attached provides some detailed information that may be of help as you 
reflect on this.

Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Siemens Westinghouse and four European utilities have formed a
consortium to build a 1 MW hybrid power generation plant that will combine a
Siemens solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a microturbine, which will be
supplied by the consortium utilities.  The unit will be tested as a
pre-commercial system for the European market and is expected to be in
operation by October 2003 at an Energie Baden-Wurttenberg AG (EnBW) facility
in Marbach, Germany.
* Two European utilities have awarded Siemens Westinghouse contracts
for their tubular solid oxide fuel cell system.  The two pre-commercial
units, one of which will be delivered to RWE Power AG in Essen (February
2002) and the other to Edison Spa in Milan (September 2002), will be 300kW
hybrid systems incorporating a microturbine and operating on natural gas.
* Real estate companies Arden Realty, CALPERS and RREEF dedicated two
large commercial solar power systems yesterday in Los Angeles.  The first
installation features nearly an acre of photovoltaic panels located on the
roof of a three-story office building owned by Arden Realty while the second
is located on an industrial building in Carlsbad, CA that is jointly owned
by CALPERS and RREEF (joint venture company is named CalWest Industrial
Properties).  Real Energy Corporation will sell the power generated by these
systems to the respective building owners.  Edison Development Corp., a
subsidiary of DTE Energy, supplied the solar panels that were built and
installed by PowerLight Corporation.

12/20 -- The Fed Has No Time to Dawdle
It should have cut rates on Dec. 19. Every month Greenspan waits before 
acting makes it that much harder to avoid a downturn
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001220_822.htm

12/20-- Greenspan & Co. Could Pull the Trigger Before Long
Though the Fed declined to cut interest rates now, it may not even wait till 
the next policy meeting to act -- if the stock market keeps falling
http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/dec2000/nf20001220_617.htm

12/18 -- Greenspan's Ace in the Hole: Productivity
He still thinks its strong growth will avert a recession. But if the slowing 
continues, watch for quick rate-cut action

ENE: Reiterate Buy; Believe Leadership Still Intact

* ENE has underperformed its peer group of Energy Merchants.  Stock
price down 39% from 52-week high ($90 on August 23) vs. peer group, up 1.9%.
* We reiterate our Buy rating on the stock, and believe the weakness
is largely due to concern over ENE's group-high P/E multiple and PEG ratio
of 27x and 1.3x, respectively (group average 19x and 1.0x), coupled with a
series of concerns over various parts of Enron's business: bandwidth, India,
etc.
* Our sense is that the bandwidth unit is performing on target, and is
likely to beat the strong numbers posted last quarter.  India, while a
significant issue, remains a small part of Enron's asset base (about 4%).
It is a legacy business, in our view, and does not materially affect our
overall view of the company.
* We see ENE's business fundamentals intact, and in fact, improving.
Growth rate expansion to 25% from 20%; growing returns on capital; bandwidth
trading all good reasons to own stock -- justify premium valuation.

automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all
