Subject: Plains All American Yield  

Mike-
I spoke with two analysts this afternoon on why Plains' All American has a 
lower yield than EOTT.  I have calls out to two others that follow both MLPs.

Solomon Smith Barney's view -
PAA still has capacity to make acquisitions.  They will still have a debt to 
total capital ratio of around 30% even after trading loss.  They raised $50 
million equity before trading loss, will net around $100 million from sale of 
linepack and are rumored to be asking between $100 and $150 million for pipe 
from California to Texas.  Solomon expects PAA to continue making the minimum 
quarterly distribution and in 9 - 12 months thinks they will be back in the 
growth game and distribution increases are likely.

The perception is that EOTT's cash coverage is not as strong and a 
distribution increase is not as likely at this point.

A.G. Edward's view -
PAA was "on a roll" and had bright prospects before the trading loss.  The 
trading loss was a setback, but they still have the flexibility to do more 
transactions after the sale of linepack and the California to Texas pipeline 
are sold.

Before the trading loss they could have done a $500 million deal.  Now they 
can probably still do a $250 million deal.  The market liked the approach 
they were taking and thinks they can get back on track.

He also felt there is a good chance they will be able to increase the 
distribution within the next year.


I will give you additional feedback when I get it.

Scott

Thanks for the update, but Steve's position is pretty pathetic. If (when) the

Subject: Steve Todoroff--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

I wanted you to be aware of something we learned today from one of our 
trading counterparties.  Dana Gibbs spoke with an individual at Koch who has 
recently spoken with Todoroff.  Apparently, Todoroff is in the job market.  
He has apparently indicated that he intends to sue EOTT for defamation as 
soon as EOTT links his name with the NGL theft.  He also apparently told Koch 
that his attorneys are "ready to go with the lawsuit" as soon as EOTT links 
his name with the theft.  

Todoroff's "planned lawsuit"  may just be some more yarn in this fabrication, 
but it emphasizes again the need to keep this matter as confidential as 
possible (at least until Todoroff is indicted). 

On a side note, Todoroff has certainly developed an interesting interview 
technique!  Just imagine going in for a job interview and saying, "My former 
employer is alleging that a former trader stole millions of $$$.   I'm just 
waiting on them to say that I'm the thief so I can sue them."  With that 
story, I'm surprised employers aren't beating down his door to give him a job.

Susan, Thanks to you and Walt and all others who worked on this.  Having a 
check of that magnitude come to us by June certainly 
exceeded my expectations.  And this did not just happen...you folks did an

Now Walt, if you can just assure us that in Mr. Todoroff's situation that

Susan, I spoke this morning with Nancy Manderson (outside counsel for our 
crime policy insurer).  She has accepted my changes to the Assignment and 
Release, and she will be forwarding an original of the Assignment and Release 
to EOTT for execution.  She said we will have our check for $2,503,000.00 
next week!  The check will be delivered to Phillip Bair with our insurance 
broker.

We also had a long conversation about the insurer's claim against Gas 
Producers.  I shared with Nancy some of the research we have done on the 
conversion claim against Gas Producers.  I assured her that EOTT would fully 
cooperate if the insurer did pursue the claim against Gas Producers.  I 
gathered from her comments, however, that the insurer is concerned that Gas 
Producers may not have sufficient assets to satisfy anything but a small 
judgment.  I do not know whether the insurer has actually conducted a 
"financial investigation" of Gas Producers.

Earlier this week, I spoke with Bill Moore (the chief prosecutor in the 
Harris County District Attorney's Special Crimes Unit) regarding the 
above-referenced matter.  Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative 
materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is 
commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the 
desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr. 
Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send 
a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he 
assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon 
some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that 
he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call 
Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this 
matter.

We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of 
Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are 
describing as "The Second Transaction."  If Louis Dreyfus does not 
voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that 
tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or 
seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some 
notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it 
appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss 
with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with 
Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a 
conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.

If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its 
conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how 
aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

Team
 Over lunch I received a voice mail from Salamon Smith Barney concerning 
EOTT's bid on the this package.  The silence since Monday spoke volumes and 
he confirmed that.  Jonathon Barrett stated that companies that were asked in 
were a "number of multiples higher than us" and he was NOT referring to 
EBITDA multiples BUT multiples of our overall value.  He indicated 
willingness to provide more color and how this played out and my return phone 
call found out he was travelling so I'll keep you posted on what I learn. 
 In an attempt to justify a price twice our offer, I had to 1) reduce DCF 
rate to 10%, 2) assume no taxes ongoing, 3) increase the staff reduction to 
75%, 4) add the volume gain at Texas City and 4) increase volumes to 250 
MBPD.  We were willing to explore 2 and 3 and even pay some for volumes over 
204 but I think our stretch number would be 200 or less.
 Anyway a good shot at a good package of assets that came up way short.  Once 
again, I appreciate your assistance on this project and look forward to 
working with you again.

Here is the initial feedback from the Montana lawyers.  Looks like Lloyds is 
more interested settling with EOTT as part of a global buy out of all old 
InterNorth policies. I wouldn't place any stock whatsoever in the comment 
Lloyds' representative made about Studdert.  He has been very helpful and 
highly professional in all matters pertaining to this case.  EOTT and Enron 
might be able to negotiate some sort of settlement as part of a global buy 
out, but I don't know if Enron would even consider this.  Studdert might have 
the best feel for this.  Separately, the defendant group will get back to us 
on any offer they might be willing to make to settle just the Montana case, 
but it appears that their real interest would be in a "global" deal.  Any 
comments?  SWD

I spoke with Jim McAndrews late this afternoon.  I told him EOTT was 
interested in following up on the possibility of settling the case, which he 
left open after the trial.

He said that, after trial, London concluded they wanted to, in essence, buy 
out all of Enron Corp's coverage and were not interested in settling the case 
on its own.  They corresponded with Jim Studdert a few times during the 
winter, but Jim responded in a way that John said was rude.

If we are interested in talking about a buy-out, London would be interested.  
I told him that would be very difficult for EOTT to arrange, as it is not the 
sole insured.  I asked if buying out just EOTT's coverage was a possibility.  
He pointed out that there is a strong connection between the two (Enron's 
listing in Martindell lists EOTT's attorneys, he claims) and thinks it could 
be done as one package.  In any event, London really wants to deal with all 
the coverage under the Internorth policies.

I told him I had heard about the buy-out campaign elsewhere and had forwarded 
material to Studdert on that issue.  I need to follow-up with Studdert and 
Duffy to figure out where Enron/EOTT is on this issue now.

I asked what number his people would be willing to pay just to settle the 
Ashland claim, in the likely event that there could be no buy-out.  He said 
he would need to talk with London about that.  I suspect it will be quite 
small.

We agreed that we would each speak with our people and get back in touch 
early next week.

I left a voice mail with Steve to this regard, but I'm copying him as well 
for his information.

    FYI 

It is anticipated that Enron will announce later this week, a new "Employee 
Stock Option Plan". 

Approximately 45 days ago we analyzed the cost of EOTT's participation in 
this program.  The cost impact was $2.5 - $3.0 for each year over the next 
five years with no provision of supervesting in the event a business group 
was divested during the term of the grant.  Based on these factors, a 
decision was made for EOTT not to participate in the program at this time.

While EOTT employees will not directly receive communications on this 
program, it is possible that the senior leadership group could receive a 
question on EOTT's participation.   We have elected not to send an EOTT 
employee communication about nonparticipation to avoid raising the issue 
where not necessary.

If you receive questions, you may refer the individual to me or answer with 
the appropriate response based on the information in this e-mail.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation and support of this decision.  If 
you have further questions or comments, please advise.

I am going to see Dan Leff today about possible opportunities with EES.  The 
resolution of my situation with EOTT  will turn, at least in part, upon 
whether there is some kind of spot for me down at Enron, but in any case, we 
should be thinking now about how the two of you would like to approach a 
number of important issues which I have been handling from the legal 
perspective.  These are:

1.  Project Phoenix:  I am assembling the task force needed to do this deal.  
I have the working relationship with the negotiating counterparts on the 
Equilon side and am prepared to negotiate the key transactional documents.

2.  Koch Curative and Commercial Disputes:  There are a number of open 
Cosmos/curative and commercial matters b/w ourselves and Koch which need to 
be addressed as soon as possible, including the supply contract issue.  Since 
I had primary responsibility for negotiating the Cosmos PSA, I have a strong 
relationship with the "players" on the Koch side and am prepared to assist 
Dana in getting these issues resolved.

3.  The Koch Registration:  Ditto "2" above, but this qualifies as a separate 
matter b/c of the NYSE and SEC implications for EOTT.

4.  The Oxy Deal:  This deal appears to be accretive for our West Coast 
business and while we hope to sign the definitive agreements in the near 
term, there will still be a number of challenges we will have to face in 
getting all of the permits, etc. completed to enable us to perform with Oxy.  
A number of legal calls will have to be made in this context.

5.  Arizona Asphalt Terminals:  These were sold to Paramount Petroleum three 
years ago under a contract-for-deed arrangement.  I handled this deal.  
Paramount will complete its payments soon and there are a number of issues to 
be covered in conveying legal title to these properties to Paramount.

As you both know, there are variousf other issues I am working on, including 
the Lloyd's (Montana) case, our ongoing legal situation regarding spills/risk 
assessment, etc., and the general day-to-day management of the Legal 
Department.  There are a number of ways to tackle the issues listed above, 
but since Molly has had no real involvement in these matters to date (with 
the exception of the Koch supply contract), I thought that it would make 
sense for the three of us to sit down at some point to discuss workable 
alternatives for transitioning through these important items.  Molly will be 
quite busy over the next several weeks with the move and certain  
commercial/systems matters. 

However my personal situation turns out, I want you both to know that I want 
to do everything I can to assist in a smooth and workable transition.  With 
both the South Shore Harbor meeting and the move approaching, it would be 
good if the three of us could spend some time on these matters sometime 
soon.  Please let me know.  Thanks.  SWD

When things slow down, I'd like to get together with you and the wife so you
all can meet Anne.  Maybe lunch one weekend at the club or something like
that...

Stan, Louise said I don't know why but when I saw this I thought of Stan 
Horton!



An 80-year old man was having his annual checkup and the
doctor asked him how he was feeling.

"I've never been better!" he boasted.  "I've got an eighteen
year old bride who's pregnant and having my child!  What do
you think about that?"

The doctor considered this for a moment, then said, "Let me
tell you a story.  I knew a guy who was an avid hunter.  He
never missed a season.  But one day, he went out in a bit of
a hurry, and he accidentally grabbed his umbrella instead of
his gun."  The doctor continued, "So he was in the woods,
and suddenly a grizzly bear appeared in front of him!  He raised
up his umbrella, pointed it at the bear and squeezed the
handle. And do you know what happened?" the doctor queried.

Dumbfounded, the old man replied, "No."

The doctor continued, "The bear dropped dead in front of
him!"

"That's impossible!" exclaimed the old man.  "Someone else
must have shot that bear."

"That's kind of what I'm getting at," replied the doctor.

 I had hoped that I would have been better able to discuss the details of my 
decision to remain with EOTT yesterday morning. 
 In meeting with Mary Ellen following our discussion, she stated that you 
instructed her to begin preparing an employment contract but she had no other 
details other than to say she would be seeking the boards approval.
  
 The position I was considering,  upon leaving EOTT,  had an employment 
contract as well, so I did not think that EOTT would be opposed to the same 
since most of the officers have now or have had in the past a similar 
document.  I was  also offered a substantial amount of money to join (a 
so-called sign on bonus), a small increase in overall compensation and a 
sizeable stock option grant. 
After considerable reflection over the last several days, my decision to 
remain with EOTT was due to your statements/commitments , those by Dana and 
the many visitors I have had during Friday and Monday asking me to remain 
with the company...........I  have made the decision to remain and would not 
expect to have to forego the value presented by the  current external 
offer.    

I would really like to be able to complete an agreement in the next day, even 
if it is an email agreement to be followed by the proper paperwork later.    
I look forward to providing ever increasing benefit to a newly energized  
EOTT,  moving toward excellence in the industry and higher value in the 
marketplace.

Thank you for your e-mail updating us on the Ripley Campus Grand Opening 
events.    I have purchased a table at the Wednesday, April 11, HEART OF GOLD 
CELEBRATION  luncheon at the Wortham Center, and my wife and I will be 
attending.

However, I am unable to attend any of the other events due to my busy work

Tell Angela I look forward to seeing her at the HEART OF GOLD CELEBRATION

Mary Ellen could you help me with two matters:
1.  Before we make the final decision on selecting a consultant group on team 
building for EOTT's leadership, I would 
like to meet with the principals.  Could you please give me their phone 
numbers.

2.  And following up on an earlier request could you please give me the 
ratings and rankings of our employee group that we 
conducted at the end of 1999.

Thanks for your help.

With the attached note, all analysts' estimates posted on First Call are 
after the mark-to-market impact.  After third quarter earnings were released, 
we told the analysts few transactions would be marked-to-market at year end.  
As a result, we would expect mark-to-market to be negative in the fourth 
quarter also.

With Dain Rauscher's revisions, the concensus is $0.03 for the fourth quarter 
of 1999 and $0.24 for the full year.

  EOT:B-Aggr;REJIGGERING EOTT ESTIMATES TO REFLECT MARK-TO-MARKET

   Adjusting Estimates To Reflect Mark-To-Market: We are changing our 1999
  year-end and fourth-quarter estimates for EOTT Energy to reflect the
impact
  of mark-to-market (noncash adjustments to reflect current value of the
  contract portfolio). For the year, we are excluding the cumulative benefit
of
  $1.7 million (or $0.07 per unit) take in the 1Q99. However, we are
including
  the $2.8 million ($0.12 per unit) negative impact of mark-to-market for
the
  3Q99. So our 1999 earnings/distributable cash flow (DCF) estimates decline
to
  $0.23/$1.25 per unit from $0.40/$1.40. Our 4Q00 earnings estimates fall to
  $0.02 from $0.10 per unit, which assumes a $2.0 million negative impact
from
  mark-to-market. Our 2000 earnings/DCF estimate remains at $0.65/$1.55 per
  unit and we are initiating our 2001 estimates of $0.70/$1.60.
   Acquisitions Continue To Be In The Cards: We have seen the partnership
  quadruple the amount of pipeline miles it controls to 8,200 miles over the
  last 24 months. Continued success in integrating the Koch assets and the
  Texas-New Mexico Pipeline with the rest of the asset base should continue
to
  provide cost savings and build cash flow. Although management has laid low
  over the last six months on the acquisition front, we believe there are
  several opportunities within the sector. As we have suggested before, the
  consolidation going on within the major oil companies may fuel the
  consolidation within the crude oil transportation segment. Major oil
  companies are focusing on their strengths of E&P and retail, while
divesting
  noncore assets. In addition, the numbers of players in the crude oil
  transportation business continues to diminish.
  The balance sheet for EOTT is in good shape at a debt/capitalization
  percentage of 56%. EOTT could take on more acquisitions. With another
large
  acquisition we could see coverage of the distribution improve.
Unfortunately
  the unit price has fallen to unattractive levels to make acquisitions. If
the
  price of the units were to improve, we could see the partnership
aggressively
  go after other acquisitions.

Stock Opinion

  We consider the Enron support of $26 million for distribution through
March
  2001 as a safety net. Distributable cash flow should be able to cover the
  common distribution. We look for yield improvement in the EOT units to
9.5%
  yield, still a discount to the peer group but an improvement over the
current
  14.8%. Using this yield valuation and the current $1.90 distribution, we
have
  a 12-month price target of $20 per unit.
  The units have not reacted to the improvement in the MLP arena. Since the
  beginning of the year two short-term trends has subsided (tax-loss selling
  and Y2K concerns), which have helped the MLP group. Even interest rate
  concerns seemed to wain with the reduction of the long-term bond rates.
  However, EOT units have not participated in this move. We believe once the
  partnership reports 4Q99 results and discusses acquistiion potential the
  market may take notice. We recommend investors take advantage of the
weakness
  and purchase the EOT units.

  Company Description

  EOTT is a major independent marketer of crude oil in North America. Enron
  Corporation effectively holds a 44% interest in the partnership. The
  partnership owns or leases 440 trucks and owns 8,200 miles of intrastate
and
  interstate pipeline and gathering systems.

Ted Gaylord has advised that he no longer wishes to serve as Board Chairman, 
although he does intend to remain on the Board.  There appear to be no other 
changes.  Suggest the four of us discuss the " Board Chairman"  situation as 
soon as possible. I have a call into Baird to explore (1) whether we need a 
Board Chairman per se, and (2) whether there will be any "disclosure" issues 
around Ted stepping down as Board Chairman.  SWD

		 Subject: Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees

Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors 
meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect 
EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent 
that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.

Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the 
Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.

Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the 
Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the 
outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on 
EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the 
outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued 
service.

Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you 
would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on 
last year's "annual meeting" agenda.

Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

My copy of the message did not have an attachment, so I have yet to see the
letter.  I think we should be VERY careful what we say in such a letter,
because it will be the GISB Board that decides what the organization does
going froward, and the EC will decide how to handle any requests for
standards if and as they are proposed.

Bill

Dear Board Task Force:
At meetings with EEI recently, they asked Jim Buccigross, Jim Templeton and
I
if we could send them (Larry Brown) a letter indicating that the GISB
organization did not intend to impede the progress of EEI/CUBR in developing

Uniform Business Rules, and further that we would support such a product if
a
new organization were created.  Attached is a draft letter, carefully worded

-- and probably not everything that they want.  I will try to set up a
conference call later in the week to discuss this letter, the status report
sent to you previously, and white paper, a strawman, and commitment letter
to
be forwarded to you shortly.  Best Regards,  Rae

Last week I reported to our Board of Directors that our highest priority 
objectives for 2000 
are to continue to substantially improve our safety and environmental record 
throughout this 
year.  These objectives supersede any and all of our financial objective for 
2000. 
EOTT 2000 Objectives:
Environmental - Reduce reportable spills and leaks by 50%
Safety - Reduce lost time accidents by 30%

I am pleased to report that our Regional Business Managers, District Managers 
and their 
teams are working closely with Operations Governance to ensure that those 
objectives are met.

Please take time to read the following article:

	When pipelines are time bombs
	2 million miles of them deliver potential catastrophe every day

By Patrick McMahon, USA TODAY(Front Page Article 3/14/00
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. - Last summer, an underground pipeline ruptured in a city 
park here and sent a torrent of gasoline along a wooded streambed toward two 
10-year-olds playing with a barbecue lighter.

After the 16-inch pipeline had been hemorrhaging for an hour and 34 minutes, 
an explosion sent a fireball racing through the park. A plume of smoke rose 
30,000 feet.

Authorities say the blast probably was triggered by a spark from the lighter.

"There was a spark and the sky turned orange, the boys both told me 
afterward," says Frank King, whose son, Wade, was one of the boys in the 
park. Wade and his friend, Stephen Tsiorvas, were burned over 90% of their 
bodies. They died the next day.

Also killed was 18-year-old Liam Wood, who had graduated from high school 
five days before. The college-bound Wood was fly-fishing in the park when he 
was overcome by fumes, fell into the creek and drowned.

"To many people, the boys were considered heroes," says Mark Asmundson, the 
mayor of this seaside city north of Seattle. In sparking the explosion, the 
boys kept the most extensive damage confined to the 241-acre park, he says. 
"The river of gasoline was heading right for the center of the city." 

On Monday, the Senate Commerce Committee held a one-day hearing here, about 
five minutes from where the incident occurred, on legislation to improve 
safety and government oversight of pipelines and the companies that operate 
them. The hearing included gripping, sometimes tearful, testimony from the 
boys' parents as well as statements from state and federal officials.

"My baby died because of inaction. His death was preventable," said Katherine 
Dalen, Stephen's mother.

More than 2 million miles of iron, steel and plastic pipes - some as large as 
5 feet in diameter - snake beneath the earth and deliver oil, gasoline, 
natural gas and potential disaster across America every day. They range from 
the trans-Alaskan pipeline to tiny pipes carrying natural gas to people's 
homes. Safer than gasoline trucks or ocean-going tankers by most measures, 
once-remote pipelines are prompting new worries as sprawling metropolitan 
areas grow into their paths.

U.S. pipeline accidents have fluctuated in the past 10 years. In the 1990s, 
there were 3,917 liquid fuel spills and natural gas leaks, roughly one a day. 
The incidents, most involving local lines carrying natural gas, resulted in 
201 deaths, 2,826 injuries and $778 million in property damage from 1990 
through 1999.

There also are environmental costs. In January, one of the nation's largest 
pipeline companies, Koch Industries of Wichita, Kan., paid a $30 million 
civil fine to settle Environmental Protection Agency water-pollution charges 
involving 300 oil spills from 1990 to 1997. The EPA said Koch failed to 
inspect its pipelines and waited for leaks before making repairs.

Liam Wood's mother, Marlene Robinson, is focused on stronger regulations 
nationwide, including more and better inspections, and regional watchdog 
committees. 

"I don't have any children left to protect," she said in an interview and 
repeated at the hearing. "This didn't have to happen to Liam, and it doesn't 
have to happen to other people's children."

Although the cause of the Bellingham incident remains under investigation, 
one factor might have been damage to the pipeline from a backhoe when a water 
line was being installed in 1995. But investigators also have many questions 
about the role of Olympic Pipeline Co., which operates a network of pipelines 
along a 299-mile corridor from north of Bellingham to Portland, Ore.

Investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) want to 
know whether Olympic ignored warning signs and whether it could have acted 
more swiftly after the leak. But the inquiry has been delayed by a parallel 
investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office. Several Olympic employees have 
declined to testify and have invoked their constitutional rights against 
self-incrimination. 

Pipeline owners and government regulators defend the safety of transporting 
two-thirds of the nation's fuels by pipeline, and they warn that more rules 
could boost energy prices. Critics say pipelines are too loosely regulated, 
not fully inspected and, in some cases, deteriorating.

The U.S. Transportation Department oversees pipelines. Its Office of Pipeline 
Safety sets standards for design, operation, maintenance and emergency 
response. Richard Felder, who heads the office, testified at Monday's 
hearing. "Our goal is to prevent incidents like Bellingham from ever 
happening again," he said.

In an earlier interview, he defended his office's performance and the 
industry: "It's a good record. It's the safest form of transporting fuel, far 
and away."

The office has extensive rules on pipeline safety, including requirements for 
signs along the route and programs to alert potential diggers, but "there's 
no such thing as risk elimination," Felder says. "All you can do is manage 
it." 

But the chairman of the federal government's transportation safety watchdog 
agency is unimpressed with Felder's office and says it deserves a grade of F. 
"It's been the most frustrating area I've had to deal with as chairman," says 
Jim Hall, NTSB chairman since 1994. He says no agency has a worse record of 
responding to NTSB recommendations.

In a recent speech, he said there's no indication that the Office of Pipeline 
Safety "is in charge or that its regulations, its inspections, its assets, 
its staffing and its spirit are adequate to the task." 

Felder takes issue with much of the criticism, but he endorses calls for more 
research into pipeline safety. He said his office is in the final stages of 
preparing new safety standards for heavily populated and environmentally 
sensitive areas.

He emphasized that the leading cause of pipeline failure is "third-party 
damage" from road, utility and construction work. The agency has worked to 
enhance a system to alert pipeline companies of digging with one telephone 
call.

Felder is critical of local authorities who ignore pipelines when making 
decisions on housing and commercial development. "Local planning has not kept 
people away from pipelines," he says. "It's astounding to me."

Felder bristles at critics' suggestions that his agency is a tool of the oil 
and gas industry. "I can't agree with that one iota," he says. "We try to 
balance the safety issue and the economic issue."

The Senate Commerce Committee will consider a bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Sens. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Slade Gorton, R-Wash.; Rep. Jack Metcalf, 
the Republican who represents Bellingham; and Rep. Jay Inslee, a Democrat 
whose district includes an operating section of the pipeline. 

The bill would require periodic internal inspections of pipelines, boost 
federal spending on research, increase the number of federal pipeline 
inspectors nationwide - there now are 55 - and expand states' regulatory 
authority. On Monday, the Office of Pipeline Safety gave the state of 
Washington the temporary right to do more inspections.

The Murray-Gorton bill also would require federal certification of pipeline 
workers and expand the public's right to know about spills and leaks. 

"I was totally shocked and amazed when this happened," Murray says. "You 
always assume that your neighborhood is safe and somebody has taken care of 
this."

The Bellingham rupture not only dumped 278,000 gallons of gasoline into this 
city of 63,000 near the Canadian border but also unleashed civic furor at 
Olympic Pipeline. "It's hard for people to get interested in things they 
can't see. Out of sight is out of mind," Mayor Asmundson says. He has visited 
the boys' grieving families and lobbied Congress. The blast "has dominated my 
life since June 10."

Pipeline operators portray accidents as isolated to escape national scrutiny, 
he says. "The whole focus of the industry is containment. Do whatever you 
have to do locally, but don't stir things up nationally."

Last week, Murray released a report she requested from the Transportation 
Department's inspector general. It faults the Office of Pipeline Safety for 
ignoring enhanced safety requirements, including increased inspections inside 
pipes, in highly populated and environmentally sensitive areas as Congress 
required in 1992 and 1996. 

A U.S. General Accounting Office audit of operations is due in May. Also 
pending is a decision from Felder and the pipeline safety office on whether 
to restart the 39-mile section shut down since the Bellingham accident. 
Olympic Pipeline has repaired the line and is eager to reopen it.

People living along the route and officials are pushing for more extensive 
testing of the still-operating section of the line south of Bellingham. 
Felder says he has not decided whether it should be shut down. 

Last week, Felder's office ordered a new round of testing along the entire 
line, but critics such as Inslee are not convinced it will be enough. The 
tests must be conducted on the closed section of the pipeline before a 
decision is made on reopening it.

Uncle Stan,
     I just wanted to write you and say hi and ask you a couple of
questions.  I wrote to Caron a couple of days ago to see how she was
doing and she told me that she has a horse show coming up.  She sounded
pretty excited about it.  I hope she does well.  I got to pitch for the
first time last weekend.  I pitched against Florida State who is number
one and I did pretty good.  I pitched 5 innings and didn't give up any
runs and gave up 3 hits.  I pitched against them again this weekend and
gave up 3 hits and 1 run in 3 innings.  I guess I'll have to teach you
how to throw strike someday.  The other thing I wanted to talk to you
about is this summer.  When you were down in Orlando last month you
mentioned something about an internship.  Tara and I really thought that
it would be really fun to come out to Texas this summer to do that.  I
was just wandering if that was still an option and if so does the offer
still stand.  I know there is still a lot Tara and I to talk about like
where we are going to live and things like that but we were just
thinking that it would be a great oppurtunity for the botb of us. Tell
Debbie I said hello and we are all wishing her the best.  Thank you for
everything.

LAWYER--CLIENT CONFIDENTIAL

People:

I have recently seen a new Navajo Nation document concerning a ROW which
reflects a "standard term and condition" I had not seen before. Since I am not
sure whether you all have seen it, I am providing it in this e-mail:

"There is expressly reserved to the Navajo Nation full territorial
legislative, executive and judicial jurisdiction over the right-of-way and all
lands burdened by the right-of-way, including without limitation over all
persons, including the public, and all activities conducted or otherwise
occurring within the right-of-way; and the right-of-way and all lands burdened
by the right-of-way shall be and forever remain Navajo Indian Country for
purposes of Navajo Nation jurisdiction."

As you appreciate, this appears to be Steve Bloxham, Esq. (Navajo Nation
Department of Justice)'s latest response to federal court decisions on Indian
jurisdiction.

Perhaps it would save time for Steve if we simply had a provision in the ROW
which said, "In the event of any conflict between opinions of federal courts
and of Steve Bloxham, Esq., the opinion of Steve Bloxham, Esq. shall govern
this ROW. All ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of the Bloxham
interpretation."

Lawrence A. Ruzow

The game was awesome.  Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.  Debbie 
said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of 
the 8th inning.  She said I never picked my nose once on camera.  Pretty 
good, huh.

Have a good day.  Talk with you later.  By the way, your car is done.  They 
had no problem removing the oil filter at all.  They only had to wriggle it a 
little bit.

Love, Daddy

Cutty, I know you are extremely busy, but as you continue to work with Phil 
Lowry on the new initiatives we have discussed,
please redouble your efforts to keep in close communication with the Regional 
business leadership.  It would also be a
great idea if you visited the EOTT trading floor at least once a day , every 
day you are in Houston.  You are off to a great start in 
developing rapport with the commercial group, so continue to build on those 
relationships.  Thanks for all you are doing on so many fronts.  EOTT is very 
fortunate to have you on are leadership team!

Subject: NBP Financing RFP's


	

Attached is a draft of the RFP for the NBP debt financing.  We recommend 
sending this RFP to:
A.G. Edwards
Banc One
Bank of America
Bank of Tokyo
CIBC
SunTrust

These institutions are either agents for a NBPL or NBP credit facility and/or 
recently have indicated a strong interest in doing future business with NBP.  
In recent discussions, several firms have advised NBP to proceed with a 
public market transaction for the term debt.  Given their predilection for 
private placement debt, A.G. Edwards has been included so that we get two 
views on the appropriate market for the term debt issue.

You will note we have not including Lehman Brothers in our recommendation.  
As I indicated to you last week by e-mail (see attached), we are focusing on 
commercial banks to improve their relationship profitability to incent them 
to be more committed with immediate funding for acquisitions.  We have 
reviewed this approach with Jeff McMahon's group (through Charles Delacey) 
and they concur.  I am not aware of the "chits" that may be owed Lehman (or 
other I-banks) but our thought was if our last deal cleaned the slate we 
would concentrate on our commercial bank relationship strategy.  Certainly 
Lehman would have an opportunity to play in future deals, especially equity.

I will be travelling Thursday and Friday so please leave word with John Jesse 
(402)398-7843 if this list is acceptable.  If you would like to discuss 
please leave me a message and I will call you from NY.

Subject: NBP Financing RFP's

Just to give you a "heads-up" we are preparing a request for proposal for 
lead managers on a NBP debt financing.  The financing plan is for a $150 
million term debt facility to payoff existing MLP bank debt and a $150 
million bank revolver (which would be undrawn) to provide greater financial 
flexibility in the future.  Although we haven't determined the list of 
bidders a key objective is to provide additional fee income to those banks 
willing to commit their balance sheets when needed (i.e. commercial banks) to 
strengthen our position for future acquisition financing.  We will send you a 
copy of the RFP and a list of recommended bidders mid next week.  We would 
anticipate sending this out late next week.

Stan:
 Attached, for your review and comment, are several drafts of communications 
pieces that you have requested in conjunction with the organization changes 
we are announcing next week.
 The first is a draft of an "FYI from GPG" to explain the why behind the 
reorg.  You and I discussed sending it out sometime around Wednesday, July 
19th.  


 The other three drafts are proposed approaches to customer letters--the 
first of which regards Larry's retirement and Bill's appointment to succeed 
him, the second to go to FGT's customers amplifying on Rock's new role and 
Danny's arrival, and the third to Northern's/Transwestern's customers 
regarding Bill's departure and Danny's new role.



 I would appreciate it if I could get your reaction ASAP.  I expect to be out 
of the office for several days following our return from Omaha Monday 
afternoon, and would like to put in place whatever needs to be done to get 
all these items out in whatever timeframe you deem appropriate.

Thanks for the update, Walt.  One option we were considering was a "share the 
pain" settlement with Dreyfus, whereby they would let us buy out of the 
remaining position at a steep discount (to acknowledge their contributory 
negligence in this matter).  Has there been any additional headway in this 
area?  I'm on vacation and haven't heard anything on this.  Weren't we going 
to send a V&E litigator to visit Dreyfus' general counsel? If we commence 
legal proceedings against Dreyfus, things will become costly and contentious 
between us. Information will come slowly and grudgingly.  We have copies of 
some of their internal notes which indicate that they knew---or should have 
known---that something wasn't quite right with Todoroff's situation.  Before 
we start filing discovery motions, we should exhaust the possibility of 
meeting with their general counsel to see if a quick "business" settlement 
can be obtained.  Please advise. Thanks.  SWD

Subject: Todoroff Prosecution--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
PRIVILEGE

Earlier this week, I spoke with Bill Moore (the chief prosecutor in the 
Harris County District Attorney's Special Crimes Unit) regarding the 
above-referenced matter.  Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative 
materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is 
commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the 
desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr. 
Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send 
a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he 
assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon 
some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that 
he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call 
Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this 
matter.

We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of 
Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are 
describing as "The Second Transaction."  If Louis Dreyfus does not 
voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that 
tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or 
seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some 
notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it 
appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss 
with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with 
Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a 
conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.

If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its 
conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how 
aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

I talked to Dave about the PRC process and he has invited me to attend the 
GPG Managers PRC meeting on July 20.  This will help me understand the 
process "live".  I will be meeting with Anne Vaughn in advance of this 
meeting, hopefully next week.  Anne will walk me through the portion of the 
data gathering process and game plan as to how we can utilize the process and 
potentially the software to initiate a similar process in EOTT.

Ladies & Gentlemen:

This is to confirm your appointment as a member of the Performance Review 
Committee (PRC) that will cross-calibrate mid-year performance rankings for 
all GPG manager-level employees.

For the first time, we will convene a GPG-wide PRC to review the ratings 
developed in functional and business-unit performance-mangement sessions in 
order to determine final ratings for all employees in manager positions.  
This cross-calibration, which will be ratified by GPG's Management Committee, 
will help ensure equity in how performance is measured and rewarded for our 
managers. 

Your participation is critical to the success of  this meeting, which is 
scheduled for Thursday, July 20, in Houston at 1:00 PM. (We'll shoot to be 
finished between 5:30 and 6:00 PM.)  Please advise me a soon as possible

Kundsen, corporate vice president of compensation, will facility this 
important meeting for us, I will participate with you as a member of the 
committee.  Additional information about the session will be provided to you 
as the meeting date draws nearer.

Please contact me with any questions you have regarding the meeting.

Q2 earnings report looks very good!  Congratulations.  I will keep it quiet 
until you are sure of the numbers. We should let Causey and Hayslett know for 
planning purposes ASAP. 

Given the recent events related to the proposed sale do you think it is even 
worth discussing the Benefits issue with Corporate?

Also, have we finalized all of the divestiture/retention deals?

Have a good week.  Thanks.

Dear Board Task Force:

Please disregard the previous note with the same subject.

At meetings with EEI recently, they asked Jim Buccigross, Jim Templeton and I
if we could send them (Larry Brown) a letter indicating that the GISB
organization did not intend to impede the progress of EEI/CUBR in developing
Uniform Business Rules, and further that we would support such a product if a
new organization were created.  Attached is a draft letter, carefully worded
-- and probably not everything that they want.  I will try to set up a
conference call later in the week to discuss this letter, the status report
sent to you previously, and white paper, a strawman, and commitment letter to
be forwarded to you shortly.  Best Regards,  Rae

I would appriciate if you would send to me each week the PGE Position 
Report.  Also, at your convenience I would like to spend some time via 
telephone to run through the report to make sure I understand just what is 
being reported.  I'll have my assistant call to set-up the phone call early 
next week.

Also, to whom in Risk Management do you send the position report?

Thanks.

** Proprietary **

Louie:  I think the letter to Mr. Trujillo is excellent, particularly as it 
follows on the strategy suggested by Zaman.  It signals that there is no 
sense in talking unless we can resolve compensation issues, but suggests 
there will be other issues we need to discuss.  If we want to emphasize that 
we cannot acquiesce in their terms and conditions, we could insert to the 
second sentence in the final paragraph of the letter: "It would seem best to 
schedule a meeting with the entire Task Force to discuss consideration and 
other key issues once the Nation has responded to this portion of 
Transwestern's offer."  Please raise any other questions you may have.  Lynn

Also, Rod Hayslett is checking with Michael Anderson on whether Wessex would

Stan,
          Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether 
Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales 
channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing 
services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew 
Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other 
possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with 
him when you are in the UK.

Cindy - please see the attached tables and graphs.   I would print out 
"ROW-Case2", and "Model".  The graph is hard to read unless there is a color 
printer.  Even then, it is much better to review electronically since there 
are hidden "notes" that appear when the reader uses the cursor to "point" to 
any given data point.  

I'd suggest the boss look at the electronic version of the graph while 
reviewing hard copy of the "ROW-Case2", and "Model".
   
Let me know if he would like to discuss...Louie

fyi   Our contract with Latex Construction provides that they will assume 
responsibility for the $33,000/day liquidated damages from the FPL contract 
provided that we release them to start construction in a timely manner, and 
that we have in place the required permits, ROW, and all permanent material 
for construction.

Also, we will be asking FERC for clarification, or in the alternative for 
rehearing, that we will be allowed to construct water crossings after June 
1.  FERC misunderstood a request by FDEP that construction across water 
bodies be limited to the period between November 1 and June 1.  FDEP has 
issued our preliminary permits without this requirement, and has given us a 
letter confirming that we may construct after June 1.  We need to be able to 
construct after June 1 to make the October 1 inservice for FPL.

Stan,

In response to EEI's questions, I prepared a list of wholesale electric 
issues that need to be addressed by a national standards board.  

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Jeff

One of EOTT's top priorities is to excel in environmental compliance because 
that is the right thing to do and because we want to be a good neighbor.  We 
do not need any other reasons...but in case we needed one more, please read 
Ms. Browner's remarks below.

Also, the Secretary of EPA's remarks vividly demonstrate the value of good 
relationships, open communications and mutual respect between EOTT and 
environmental agencies.  Al Hugh, Paul Newman and the EH&S team along with 
EOTT field management and employees have a great track record of doing just 
that.  And we obviously intend to redouble our efforts to continue to improve 
that spirit of cooperation and enhance that mutual respect.

Carol M. Browner, Administrator Environmental Protection Agency Remarks
Prepared for Delivery
Clean Water Act Enforcement Press Conference

Washington, D.C.
Jan. 13, 2000

Good afternoon.
>From Day One, this Administration has been dedicated to the principle
that corporations
must be held accountable for damage they cause to the environment. It's
this simple: You pollute, you pay.
We will not allow companies to profit at the expense of the environment
and public health
With that in mind, today, EPA and the Justice Department are announcing
the largest civil fine ever imposed against a single company for
violations of environmental law -- a $30- million civil penalty against
Koch Industries of Wichita, Kansas.
I want to thank Texas State Attorney General John Cornyn for joining EPA
in the suit that brought this settlement about. I also want to thank
Attorney General Reno and the Justice Department for all their help with
today's action and all my colleagues at EPA.
This has been one of our most difficult and contentious environmental
actions ever. It wasn't until the consent decree was even signed that we
got a map. It wasn't until we got a judge to rule the company was liable
that serious discussions began.
Koch Industries owns and operates 35,000 miles of pipeline in the
Midwest and South that carry crude oil and other related products,
making it the largest pipeline company in the country.
An EPA investigation found that over a seven-year period from 1990 to
1997 Koch illegally discharged more than three million gallons of crude
oil from its pipelines and into the ponds, lakes, rivers and shorelines
of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Alabama.
These spills occurred in more than 300 separate locations. EPA charged
that this pollution could have been -- and should have been -- prevented
by Koch Industries through the proper operation and maintenance of their
pipelines.
In Payne County Oklahoma home of Oklahoma State University over 221,000
gallons were released resulting in an oil spill that traveled 25 miles
to Keystone Lake, a popular recreational facility.
In Corpus Christi Bay, 90,300 gallons spilled, resulting in the oiling
of migratory birds and the killing of thousands of fish.
In a rural community northeast of Wichita, Kansas, part of a public
water supply system was forced to shut down as a result of over 78,000
gallons of unleaded gasoline spilling into a nearby creek.
In Grayson County, Texas just north of Dallas-Fort. Worth nearly 63,000
gallons spilled into a creek that flows into the Hagerman National
Wildlife Refuge. This Refuge is a popular birding area where several
endangered species can be seen.
With today's settlement, Koch Industries commits to take actions that
should prevent this from happening again.
Their failure to invest in appropriate pollution prevention mechanisms
led to this fine and the millions of dollars they will now have to spend
to bring their systems into compliance.

Besides the $30-million civil penalty which will be split between the
federal government and the state of Texas Koch also has agreed to spend
$5 million on environmental projects in the states it polluted.
$1.5 million will go to buy and preserve wetlands or wildlife habitats
in Kansas and Oklahoma. $2.5 million will go to Texas for environmental
projects to be carried out under the direction of the state. And
finally, $1 million will be used to pay for a pipeline safety study in
Texas and Oklahoma.
The company will also hire an independent auditor who for a minimum of
three years will inspect and report on whether the company is meeting
the requirements of this settlement.
This Administration has pledged to protect public health and preserve
the environment by making sure there is no profit in pollution.
You pollute. You pay. It's that simple.

 Joe advises that Equilon's Board has decided to go forward with us.  They 
want to get an MOU signed up this week.  I believe we can manage disclosure 
on this for the next few weeks (at least until we file our 10Q).  Also, I met 
with Tom White today and he will ask Dan Leff or Jeff Messina to contact me 
about possibilities at EES.  Thanks.  SWD

Today I received a somewhat unpleasant letter from Mr. Mark Wilson at Koch.  
Koch is saying that it has been damaged by the delay in the registration of 
its EOTT common units and is making veiled threats of legal action against 
EOTT.  The tone of Mr. Wilson's letter is inappropriate in my view.  I will 
send each of you a copy of Mr. Wilson's letter and I will work with Bob Baird 
in framing an appropriate response from EOTT.  At this juncture, since it now 
appears that it will be at least several more weeks before we know whether 
the Phoenix deal will become "disclosable,"  it might make sense to advise 
Koch about Phoenix on the condition of strict confidentiality (Dana's 
suggestion).  Bob, could we do this?  If we could do this, Koch would be able 
to appreciate the dilemma posed by the Phoenix deal and how this impacts the 
S-1 filing.  SWD

Spoke with David Harvin, a senior litigator at V&E.  He believes it would be 
prudent to call it an "apparent theft" in the two places where" theft" 
appears in the release.  Accordingly, this change should be made and the 
"analysts" script should be revised accordingly.  Please advise if there are 
any questions. Thanks.  SWD

Stan,

Once again I appreciate the opportunity to talk with you and Dana about the
EOTT CFO spot.   I apologize for getting back to you so late last night.  My
wife and I had just left the hospital and were grabbing a late bite to eat.
I was thinking a little more about our discussion and wanted to offer a
couple of names to you that may or may not be popping up in your search:

        1) Ross Benavides-currently the CFO at Genesis
            2) Jim Diediker- former Controller at EOTT years ago.  Jim
pursued his Phd.
                at A&M and is now with AEP here locally.
            3) Ken Stockel-currently CFO at British Borneo here in town.
            4) Georgeanne Hodges- currently with Enron and could be
considered more
               at Laurie's level
I was fortunate to have all four of these folks work for me at Phibro so I
could vouch for each of them.  If you were interested in any of them feel
free to give me a call and I could give you some pros and cons relative to
your situation there.
Stan, I wish you well in finalizing your search.  All the best in turning
around the EOTT situation.


              Regards,


              Bob Flavin

Stan.  Attached are some photos from the hydrotest of the Inglis lateral.  By 
the way, the Inglis lateral runs from Station 16, south southeast down to 
Crystal River.  It is about 50 miles.

Per discussions with Entergy today regarding the Desoto County peaking 
project:
 - Entergy has an internal meeting planned later this week to decide if they 
want to continue with the project
 - The Desoto site is one of the sites which IPS did the groundwork for, as 
far as permitting, etc.

 * Entergy has a meeting scheduled with FPL to discuss a "tolling 
arrangement, whereby FP&L would provide gas        deliveries to obtain a 
portion of the power output  ------  Note:  I said this would be a major 
change in FP&L's         business approach and Entergy indicated FP&L appears 
to be changing their thinking regarding merchant power        plants and that 
FP&L may announce a new "position" on merchant plants in the next few weeks

Subject: Todoroff Prosecution--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
PRIVILEGE  

Steve, as Dana indicated in his response to your message, Louis Dreyfus is 
maintaining that their transactions with Todoroff are totally legitimate and 
binding upon EOTT.  Vinson & Elkins is of the opinion that before we assert 
an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract, we 
need to hear the tapes of Todoroff's conversations with Louis Dreyfus.  The 
"paper" that we have (including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract 
administrator) certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that 
something was not quite right about the December 1999 transaction with 
Todoroff, but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the 
validity/enforceability of that contract.  We need more.  John DeGeeter of 
Vinson & Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus'  general counsel.  Louis 
Dreyfus' general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing 
EOTT with the tapes, he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is 
requesting the tapes.  Louis Dreyfus' general counsel has also indicated that 
he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations.

Although a final decision has not been made, here's where I think we are 
headed with Louis Dreyfus.  We will send their general counsel a letter next 
week indicating the irregularities with this contract (e.g. the prices quoted 
in the contract were far below market, and the contract administrator had 
questions about Todoroff's authorization and the "legality" of the deal).  
This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with 
their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can 
immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus' 
employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  My 
guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus'  
lawyers to listen to the tapes.  If the tapes do contain incriminating 
conversations, we might see a softening of their negotiating position.  If 
the tapes do not contain anything incriminating, it would seem to be in Louis 
Dreyfus' best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position 
that there was nothing irregular about the transaction.

Subject: Re: Todoroff Prosecution--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
PRIVILEGE  

Thanks for the update, Walt.  One option we were considering was a "share the 
pain" settlement with Dreyfus, whereby they would let us buy out of the 
remaining position at a steep discount (to acknowledge their contributory 
negligence in this matter).  Has there been any additional headway in this 
area?  I'm on vacation and haven't heard anything on this.  Weren't we going 
to send a V&E litigator to visit Dreyfus' general counsel? If we commence 
legal proceedings against Dreyfus, things will become costly and contentious 
between us. Information will come slowly and grudgingly.  We have copies of 
some of their internal notes which indicate that they knew---or should have 
known---that something wasn't quite right with Todoroff's situation.  Before 
we start filing discovery motions, we should exhaust the possibility of 
meeting with their general counsel to see if a quick "business" settlement 
can be obtained.  Please advise. Thanks.  SWD

Subject: Todoroff Prosecution--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
PRIVILEGE

Earlier this week, I spoke with Bill Moore (the chief prosecutor in the 
Harris County District Attorney's Special Crimes Unit) regarding the 
above-referenced matter.  Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative 
materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is 
commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the 
desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr. 
Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send 
a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he 
assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon 
some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that 
he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call 
Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this 
matter.

We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of 
Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are 
describing as "The Second Transaction."  If Louis Dreyfus does not 
voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that 
tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or 
seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some 
notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it 
appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss 
with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with 
Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a 
conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.

If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its 
conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how 
aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

After returning home and reviewing the material handed out at the PGE 
business review, there are two areas that I think I need to understand 
better.  The first is PGE's energy positions going forward and the financial 
exposures to changing prices.  The second is the rate case.  I would be happy 
to return to Portland to get a more in depth review with a much smaller cast 
of players.  I am open to suggestions from you.

Given the status of the divestiture process, Jeff wants to make sure he (and 
subsequently I) have a good handle on these two important issues.

Thanks!

Today's strong gas prices have opened a new window of opportunity for a 
pipeline to move Wyoming gas into the Ventura market and downstream.   
Currently, Trailblazer is conducting an open season to expand its facilities 
for service between Wyoming and Gage County, Nebraska.   A number of our 
contacts in the Powder River (including ENA) are making decisions on 
Trailblazer capacity right now.    When we invested in the Bighorn gas 
gathering project in December of 1999 we viewed a connection between Bighorn 
and Northern Border Pipeline (250miles) as a strategic advantage to be 
exploited in the future.   Strong gas prices and the ramp of Powder River 
production are accelerating the feasibility of making a pipeline out of the 
Northern Powder River Basin a reality. 

While connecting the Powder River Basin to NBPL using an intrastate pipeline 
through Montana remains a real possibility, it also carries with it the 
negative baggage of NBPL being fully contracted through 2003 (and possibly 
beyond) with Canadian gas and a potential for Alaskan gas.  In the short term 
this presents us with some problems getting shippers to sign up for transport 
on the new Montana intrastate.

I would like you to think about the following concept .   A new interstate 
pipeline named "NBP-Dakota" extending from the Recluse, Wyoming area to 
Ventura, Iowa and going into service in November of 2003.   A tentative 
design and cost would be 24" diameter, 1435 MAOP, 480 miles, with capex of 
approximately $270 million.  Initial flow would be 300 mmcfd with expansion 
capability up to 490 mmcfd and an initial rate of just under 50 cents per mcf 
Recluse to Ventura.   At today's Ventura price of $4.22 this could leave 
Powder River producers a margin of more than $2.00 an mcf.   Using  August, 
1999,  Ventura pricing of $2.64  the margin would be 64 cents.  If we can 
build the pipeline at the cost  projected,  (NPNG has used Fort Union's 
actual construction costs for a 24 inch, 1440psi system - Enron Engineering 
would not even be in the same cost universe) "NBP Dakota" would be more 
competitive than sending the gas to NBPL via the Montana intrastate.  I am of 
the opinion that future looping the Trailblazer system would come in as 3rd 
place to the other 2 routes.  NBP Dakota would need to get started with an 
open season this fall to allow for a 2003 in-service date.  

THE QUESTION

I need your opinion about using "NBP Dakota" for this opportunity rather than 
feeding more gas into NBPL in the northern Montana area.  Strategically, are 
we willing to let NBPL carry the possible risk of decontracting after 2003 
without  support from the Powder River Basin ?  For what it may be worth,  I 
believe NBPL can handle that risk successfully without the Powder River 
volumes.   I need to know your views on this as the Montana intrastate topic 
is coming up for discussion at the  Bighorn Management Committee meeting 
later this summer.

FYI-
I spoke with Andrew Fairbanks, the Merrill Lynch analyst that is going to 
start covering EOTT.  He will take over coverage of several MLPs including 
Plains, Teppco, and Lakehead.  The transition will probably happen sometime 
in March.

I suggested he visit the EOTT offices to meet management.  He will probably 
take me up on the offer sometime in early March.

I am sending him historical information on EOTT, as well as the presentation 
I prepared for A.G. Edwards.

Just to give you a "heads-up" we are preparing a request for proposal for 
lead managers on a NBP debt financing.  The financing plan is for a $150 
million term debt facility to payoff existing MLP bank debt and a $150 
million bank revolver (which would be undrawn) to provide greater financial 
flexibility in the future.  Although we haven't determined the list of 
bidders a key objective is to provide additional fee income to those banks 
willing to commit their balance sheets when needed (i.e. commercial banks) to 
strengthen our position for future acquisition financing.  We will send you a 
copy of the RFP and a list of recommended bidders mid next week.  We would 
anticipate sending this out late next week.

Thanks, Stan.

And again, thank you for the hospitality.

I think next steps (in chrono order) are:

- EEI Task Force agrees with results of Houston meeting (in progress)
- GISB Board postpones electric decision and sets up group to work with us
- EEI Board agrees with Task Force approach (June 19-21)
- Group agreement on Principles (after EEI Bd)
- Group identifiication, discussion of organizational alternatives (after EEI 
Bd)
- Group agreement on organization
- EEI Board Report & action item approval
- On to detailed design & implementation

I frankly don't know if the EEI Board will agree to internal Principles and 
to investigation of organizational solutions in one sitting.  My temptation 
and recommendation is to go for it, but one can never be sure.

We need to figure out a way to work the last two items with an absolute 
minimum of physical meetings.  Perhaps I could set up a list server just for 
the players.

Your thoughts?

Thanks

Here is the initial feedback from the Montana lawyers.  Looks like Lloyds is 
more interested settling with EOTT as part of a global buy out of all old 
InterNorth policies. I wouldn't place any stock whatsoever in the comment 
Lloyds' representative made about Studdert.  He has been very helpful and 
highly professional in all matters pertaining to this case.  EOTT and Enron 
might be able to negotiate some sort of settlement as part of a global buy 
out, but I don't know if Enron would even consider this.  Studdert might have 
the best feel for this.  Separately, the defendant group will get back to us 
on any offer they might be willing to make to settle just the Montana case, 
but it appears that their real interest would be in a "global" deal.  Any 
comments?  SWD

I spoke with Jim McAndrews late this afternoon.  I told him EOTT was 
interested in following up on the possibility of settling the case, which he 
left open after the trial.

He said that, after trial, London concluded they wanted to, in essence, buy 
out all of Enron Corp's coverage and were not interested in settling the case 
on its own.  They corresponded with Jim Studdert a few times during the 
winter, but Jim responded in a way that John said was rude.

If we are interested in talking about a buy-out, London would be interested.  
I told him that would be very difficult for EOTT to arrange, as it is not the 
sole insured.  I asked if buying out just EOTT's coverage was a possibility.  
He pointed out that there is a strong connection between the two (Enron's 
listing in Martindell lists EOTT's attorneys, he claims) and thinks it could 
be done as one package.  In any event, London really wants to deal with all 
the coverage under the Internorth policies.

I told him I had heard about the buy-out campaign elsewhere and had forwarded 
material to Studdert on that issue.  I need to follow-up with Studdert and 
Duffy to figure out where Enron/EOTT is on this issue now.

I asked what number his people would be willing to pay just to settle the 
Ashland claim, in the likely event that there could be no buy-out.  He said 
he would need to talk with London about that.  I suspect it will be quite 
small.

We agreed that we would each speak with our people and get back in touch 
early next week.

I left a voice mail with Steve to this regard, but I'm copying him as well 
for his information.

Bob Baird and I are already working with Tye Darland at Koch on this general 
issue.  Tye is Koch's in-house securities lawyer.  Shelly should not call 
Koch.  Instead, Bob and I should arrange any larger EOTT/Koch meeting through 
Tye or we could wind up with confusion and possible legal difficulties.  At 
this juncture, Bob and I think it best to let the lawyers for the two sides 
handle the initial discussions on these matters (because there are potential 
inside information issues involved, etc.).  If you agree, Bob and I will 
contact Tye Darland to see how Koch wishes to proceed.

Also, everyone needs to be aware that we still have a contractual duty to 
Koch to facilitate the sale of their EOTT units through a registration 
process.  Due to our late 10-Q filing, we will now have to do an S-1 
registration for Koch instead of an S-3, and this will be considerably more 
expensive and involved.

Mike/Steve-

I think that we need to set up a meeting with Koch to discuss their request 
to sell shares and our current issue re the first quarter.  I suggest that 
Shelly call Koch -and set up the meeting.  If you agree please respond so 
Shelly can set up.  If you have any questions please give me a call.

I will be out of the office until Thursday, but I hope to have a response to 
many of the questions in this email on Thursday.  Overall, I think the work 
flow is fine, but I think we need more dialog with the insurance folks about 
how we respond to future leaks when we need ENTRIX personnel on site quickly, 
and about the scope of work that AIG would authorize ENTRIX to do in an 
initial site assessment.  I will cover these items in my response to the 
questions.

Rich Myers is working on a summary of expenses per work authorization order, 
but be aware that some of the orders are not related to TX-NMX sites.  Also, 
by the way, we get the top ENTRIX discount on hourly rates, so the rates that 
AIG pays is slightly higher than ours.

Subject: Re: CUTTY CUNNINGHAM



Mike,
This is obviously a key question for both of us.  Many years ago, I was
working in a staff job with a lot of routine and very little excitement or
pizzazz.  You offered me a position doing something I understood very well.
At the time, Pilko and Assoc. had completed an environmental assessment and
produced an "Oh My God" report which you shared with me.  Taking on the
challenge of that job, and doing well, meant changing the entire culture of
the organization.  I felt that you were sincere in your desire to do the
right things, no matter what, and I was excited about my ability to
contribute to the revamping of the entire company.  You were true to your
vision and you never, ever let me down.  I've learned a lot since then about
leadership and effecting change.  I led the Operations group into five
successive record years for TEPPCO with no major acquisitions and only
incremental expansion on the existing pipelines.  We were doing Great Things
and we all loved it.

TEPPCO added the Crude Oil Group in November, 1998.  I was very involved
in the Due Diligence and in negotiation of all the deal documents.  I am
familiar with the independent mindset of the crude oil folks and their
resistance to change.  I can see many opportunities for improvement, but I
am unable to effect needed changes.  I am working harder than ever, with
less job satisfaction than in prior times.

I appreciate your candor regarding the challenges at EOTT.  As before, you
have allowed me to peek inside and see just what lies ahead.  I will admit
that I am envious of the opportunity that you guys have before you.   The
intensity that you, David, Dana and Mary Ellen bring to the discussions of
the work being done is truly refreshing and exciting.  I like the openness
of the group and the shared commitment that I feel you all have.  Everybody
at EOTT has made it clear that joining your team would not be easy.
However, I've also heard that they are so excited about the work that they
can't wait to get to work in the morning.

I always felt that your visionary leadership combined with my bridge
building/implementing skill and leadership produced great results.  I
believe that my demonstrated determination, self-confidence and perseverance
are what lead you to talk to me in the first place.  The only thing open to
question is my desire and energy to take on a tough assignment.  Thanks in
advance for not questioning my sanity for thinking about leaving a good job
at TEPPCO to join a group of wild rebels in the midst of a revolution.  The
fact is, I love a big challenge.  Always have.  You have presented me with
the most exciting opportunity to come my way in years.  I think I am
uniquely
qualified to take on this challenge and help drive the company to new levels
of performance and profitability.  I am very excited about talking in more
detail about the position, the responsibilities and how you envision me
fitting into the team.  I will call you today to see when we can get
together.

Cutty

FYI -
As you may have noticed EOTT shares have been trading down over the past 
several days (Friday's close was 12 3/4 vs. today's close of 11 7/8).  Some 
of the weakness may be related to concern over the Midland pipeline leak that 
occurred several weeks ago.  A message was posted on the Yahoo message board 
on 2/11 noting the EOTT has recently had "a couple of BAD pipeline leaks in 
West Texas/New Mexico".  I did not recieve any questions on the Midland leak 
until today.  In addition, Jeanine Kim with PaineWebber (Ron Barone's 
analyst) called today and indicated they had several calls on the leak and on 
the reported loss of one of EOTT's top traders in Midland.

I have not had any other calls pointing to other rumors that might explain 
the weakness.

The volumes traded over the last several days does not appear unusual, with 
today's volume reported at 44,400 units.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION & ATTORNEY'S WORK 
PRODUCT

I will close the loop with Bob Baird and Rex Rogers on whether any other 
steps would need to be taken.  My only comment on your points below would be 
on the "magnitude" issue.  We told the analysts this morning that we did not 
believe that any adjustment would have a material impact on our overall 
financial position.  If we have essentially the same fourth quarter "number" 
next week, and we receive a follow- up call from one of the same analysts, 
wouldn't we want to be able to reiterate our statement?  To do otherwise 
might suggest a change in our position/perception. SWD

Below is a first pass at suggested responses assuming we do not file the 10-Q 
on or before May 22.  Kathryn Corbally will coordinate comments from the IR 
side.  Lori is coordinating comments with AA.  Steve - could you coordinate 
with Bob Baird/Rex Rogers.

If you need to reach Kathryn, her direct line is (713) 853-4785.  

Thanks -

Suggested comment if EOTT has not filed the 10-Q on May 22, 2000 (we will 
only provide response if asked):

? We are continuing our review of the implementation of our new marketing and 
accounting systems.
? We expect to have our analysis complete and the Form 10-Q finalized by June 
15.


If specifically asked about the issues under investigation:

? We implemented a new marketing and accounting system in November of 1999.  
As we stated in our first quarter earnings release, we are specifically 
reviewing integration issues related to the to this implementation.


If asked about the magnitude of possible adjustments:

? We need to complete our investigation before we can answer specific 
questions on what adjustments, if any, would be appropriate.  The required 
review is labor intensive.  We are working very diligently and will provide 
the information as soon as possible.

DATE: ??????????? July 19, 2000
 
RE:?????????????????? Contract Approval, AFEs and Consulting Arrangements

??????????? The following guidelines must be followed for all existing 
projects, as well as new contracts, AFEs and consulting arrangements.? 
 Contract Approval
??????????? Effective immediately, all contracts must be approved by legal, 
with the final version of the contract initialed by legal prior to 
execution.? Exceptions will be limited to the execution of crude oil 
purchases and sales contracts that are on a pre-approved form and occur in 
the normal course of business.? Any other exceptions must be approved by the 
Office of the Chairman.? In order to ensure that we have a handle on existing 
contracts, please provide a copy of any finalized contract which legal did 
not initial prior to execution, but is currently in effect or not yet 
performed, to Molly Sample by July 25, 2000.? 
AFEs
??????????? Based on my review of the latest AFE report, EOTT needs to 
utilize this tool to better manage all of its expenditures for budget 
purposes to ensure proper prioritization of EOTT's cash.? Company policy 
requires that all expenditures greater than $5,000 that relate to expansion 
capital and maintenance capital are required to have an AFE set up prior to 
any expenditure.? I have asked the property accounting group to monitor 
compliance with that policy starting today and hold for payment any 
expenditures not authorized according to the policy.? Effective immediately, 
all employees will be prohibited from starting any project that does not have 
an approved and signed AFE.? In addition to ensuring that the current policy 
is strictly adhered to, the policy will be broadened to include a) 
expenditures for environmental expenses captured on the EMS Works system and 
b) the use of blanket AFEs for small recurring asset purchases such as 
computer equipment (computer equipment under $5,000 would be capitalized 
under these blanket AFEs and no longer expensed).? 
??????????? In order to more accurately monitor existing AFEs, please be sure 
the following steps are taken for each AFE prepared by your department:? 1) 
obtain competitive bids prior to starting a project; 2) all projects for 
which costs are projected to exceed the approved AFE by 10% or $50,000, 
whichever is less, must have a supplemental AFE prepared and submitted for 
approval within 30 days of the projected budget overrun, and 3) any project 
that is in process and does not have an AFE must be put on hold until an AFE 
can be approved, and 4) any open AFEs that are fully completed (meaning all 
invoices have been received and routed for payment) must be closed.? A final 
capital and maintenance budget for all authorized (and still open) AFEs will 
be completed and distributed by July 25, 2000.
 ??????????? Please consult Joe Richards for information necessary to utilize 
the AFE System for all future AFE processing or for a copy of the AFE policy.
 Consulting Contracts and Service Contracts
 ??????????? Effective immediately, no new consulting arrangements may be 
entered into or extended without the approval of the Office of the Chairman.? 
Additionally, Human Resources/Administration must be contacted prior to 
entering into any consulting arrangements to 1) arrange for office space, if 
necessary for the project, and 2) to determine how the position should be 
filled (contract position, temporary employee, or permanent employee).? For 
all existing consulting agreements, please provide me with a comprehensive 
listing by arrangement, including terms and business rationale, by July 25, 
2000.? Please contact Molly Sample to prepare a contract for any undocumented 
consulting arrangements.? Written documentation on all consulting/contracting 
arrangements must be maintained by Human Resources in the event of any 
governmental agency audit of EOTT's contract employees. 
 ??????????? Contractors who provide various services, such as trucking, 
environmental cleanup, maintenance, etc. must execute a service contract and 
maintain a valid insurance certificate to remain on EOTT's approved 
contractor list, which is available on EOTT's Intranet.? Requests for service 
contractors must be sent to John Zimmerman in the Legal Department.? Please 
forward a request for contract to John for any service arrangements which are 
not documented by July 25, 2000.

Accounts Payable Documentation
??????????? Please be reminded that the Accounts Payable Department requires 
complete and timely documentation for all invoices submitted for payment.? 
This includes all charges made using a P card.? Incomplete invoices or copies 
of invoices will be returned to the submitting party.? For service contracts, 
a summary of hours, hourly rate, and a brief description of the work 
performed by person, by date, and by project, along with documentation to 
support specific authorized out-of-pocket expenses, must be submitted before 
payment can be made.? For materials, a comprehensive description of all 
items, including the quantity purchased, must be submitted before payment can 
be made.? 
 
??????????? Please notify the appropriate people in your respective 
departments of these procedures and contact me if you have any questions or 
comments.

EU backs MTBE despite US prohibition
ENDS Daily - 22/03/00
-------------------------
The European Commission said today it had no plans to
propose an EU ban on petrol additive MTBE after the US
Environmental Protection Agency proposed to "significantly
reduce or eliminate" use of the substance.  The agency says
MTBE (methyl tertiary-butyl ether) is a "possible
carcinogen" which has caused considerable damage to
groundwater.

Speaking on Monday, agency head Carol Browner said the move
was "necessary to protect America's drinking water
supplies."  She said the USA would be replacing the additive
with ethanol, a non-petrochemical alternative.  A
spokesperson for environment commissioner Margot Wallstr"m
said she was "following the reasons why" the US had proposed
its restrictions but had "no immediate plans" to call for
similar EU rules.

MTBE use in the US has tripled over the last decade.  It
forms around 11% of "reformulated gasoline" - a compulsory
fuel in some big cities, where it helps to reduce air
emissions.  However, it leaks from pipes and storage tanks
and has caught public attention because it also makes water
taste foul at very low concentrations.

In Europe, MTBE is used instead as an octane booster, and
typically only at concentrations of around 1.6% though it is
permitted up to 15%.  New EU fuel and air quality laws aimed
at eliminating benzene mean the use of MBTE is set to
increase dramatically, however.

MTBE expert Eberhard Morgenroth of the Technical University
of Denmark says the EU will soon face a "political dilemma"
between protecting air quality and groundwater.  "National
environmental protection agencies are only slowly starting
to realise the extent of problems connected to drinking
water contamination with MTBE," he says.  "It might be that
in 10 years we will have the similar problems to the US."

Denmark last month announced plans to improve petrol station
storage standards after serious MBTE contamination was found
at some sites (ENDS Daily 8 February).  Germany has also
found contaminated sites, some formerly occupied by Soviet
troops.  Neither is contemplating a ban because alternative
octane boosters such as benzene are more toxic.

There are no EU environmental quality limits governing MTBE,
but an EU-sponsored risk assessment is underway in Finland,
Europe's heaviest per-capita consumer.  An oil industry
source said a ban would "clearly put a restriction on [fuel]
blending" and would "not be a trivial problem," but said no
work had been done to estimate the impact of a ban.  As one
of the world's top ten high production volume chemicals,
however, economic effects would very likely be significant.

Mike, If this making of a list interferes in anyway with the all out effort 
that we have going on to fix our problem before Monday, I would ask that the 
list be delayed until after that effort is satisfactory.  I am receiving 
tough calls and I am keeping the wolves at bay, but I can not tell you how 
bad it will be if we are forced into giving out a bunch of plastic responses 
on Monday.   I have also been contacted by Andy at Moody's and so far I have 
him calm....but as we all know he is an explosion waiting to happen.   I am 
deeply concerned over this matter.

I agree completely that we need to scrub these issues down because there are 
gaps that we need to be sure are filled properly.

As you prepare the list of errors that were discovered as we went from an $14 
million dollar loss to a $4 million gain
for 1Q2000 please solicit input from Dana, David , Susan and Steve Myers - 
and , of course, Arthur Andersen and Solarc.
We would like the list to include:
The Error
$ amount
Type/nature of the error
Individual Accountable
The Proposed Remedy

As Stan explained, this exercise is not to play the "blame game", but to 
ensure that we learn from our mistakes and do
 not repeat them.

If at all possible will you please have the first draft of this document 
completed this Friday, May 19th.

I am asking Shelly to assist you in this effot.  Please call on her for 
help.  thanks,  mike

I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of 
your proposed broadband project.  They aren't doing anything according to Rod 
who checked for me.  It seems to me that we need to do several things to 
either kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a 
sale.  

1.  We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the 
transactions being proposed.  I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this 
issue.
2.  We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer 
or seller of Portland metro dark fiber.  If they want to be in this business 
wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a 
sale?
3.  A project of this size will take Jeff's approval.  The projected Phase I 
capital is above my threshold.

I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you.  Sound 
like a plan?

Bill - The Houston IR team had big money betting that your appointment would 
result in a major NBP price decline (and probably take the value of all other 
MLP's down as well)!!.  JUST KIDDING.  Congratulations!.  When you are in 
Houston - give me a call - there are a few things that I would suggest to 
get  you off on the right foot with the analysts.  It's a neat company , and 
I believe there is quite a bit we can do to increase the value of the units.

Subject: NBP unit reaction to DeRoin/Cordes announcement

The market received the announcement of Larry's retirement and Bill's 
succession very calmly.   I talked to each of our analysts and elaborated a 
bit on the news and answered their questions:
 - Why is Larry leaving?  Was there any "hidden" reason? 
 -  What is Bill's background?
 - Does this signal any change in strategy or direction from Enron?
 - Do we anticipate any other change in the business as a result of this 
management change?

Several said that "since this seems to not be a big change (in direction or 
strategy), I'm not going to write anything on it".


The unit price did not reflect much change.   The units opened Monday (the 
day of the news) at $29, blipped up some 3/16  just after the press release, 
and then settled back to the opening price.   Tuesday opened strong, trended 
up $.50 in heavy volume and then again settled to $29.   Wednesday's price 
closed up 1/16, at $29.0625.

Daily volumes were:  Monday 27,400 units
            Tuesday 50,200 units
                 Wednesday 20,800 units

We were hoping to communicate that this would be a fairly seamless transition 
and continue NBP's history of solid, fairly conservative management, and it 
appears that the market interpretted it exactly that way.

Mike Mitcham and I have discussed the relationship of Clean Fuel's short 
natural gas position from the production of methanol and the long position of 
Transwestern created from fuel retention.  We have came to the conclusion 
that the two positions are not compatible.  Clean Fuel's short position and 
gas consumption is directly related to their long methanol position. In order 
for Clean Fuels to not speculate and maintain a balanced hedge, a fixed price 
for natural gas and methanol is required. Methanol, is a very illiquid market 
and can not be hedged for longer than about three months out.  Because 
Tranwestern has a longer dated position, the two risks can not be efficiently 
managed.  Another risk associated with incorporating the two positions is the 
location differential.  Clean Fuels purchases their volumes off of Houston 
Pipeline and is priced at a Houston Ship Channel index related price.  The 
value between the Houston Ship Channel and Transwestern routinely fluctuates, 
making the pricing differential of the two positions somewhat difficult to 
manage. 

As stated before, because of liquidity issues, timing issues, and location 
differentials,  we feel that the positions can be better managed 
individually.  If market conditions change in the future, incorporating the 
two positions can be revisited.  If you need any additional information, 
please let me know.

louie, i do not expect the navajos to abort this deal
by a hard line position on the standard terms and
conditions. i do expect that they will take a hard
line position until they believe we mean what we say.
we have had completely contradictory expressions from
them--at one time they said they understood our
concerns and thought they could accomodate them. at
others times they have said "standard terms and
conditons, take it or leave it". i agree with lynn
that we should have very low expectations of federal
courts relieving us of the terms of our deal--perhaps
only to the extent the public interest demands it.
this is clearly a management call, but i continue to
recommend against taking the risks associated with the
general terms and conditions. jim

Ken:

It is my understanding that we must get approval from the Office of the 
Chairman to utilize the company aircraft for personal use.

My family is holding a Holiday Reunion in Atlanta December 18-23.  Debbie and 
I would like to fly to Atlanta and back on Friday, December 22, with our 
children.  The twins, Jason and Jessica, are a little bit too young yet to 
try the commercial airlines, which is why I am requesting to use a company 
aircraft.

Of course, we would only secure a plane if it is NOT needed for business 
purposes that particular day and would be subject to company policy on all 
charges.

No problem if this doesn't work!

Stan

Land owner James Moore of Gladewater Tx. reported today that EOTT Energy had 
a release of crude oil (approximately 25 barrels) that had flowed into Moody 
Creek, near Gladewater, Tx.  EOTT Response crews were dispatched to the 
site.  Booms were deployed 200 yards down stream to stop the release and to 
start recovery.  There pipe was clamped off and the leak was caused by 
internal corrosion.  Oil in the creek is approximately 20 feet wide and 200 
yards long.  Equipment on site at this time include 2 vacuum trucks, oil 
skimmers, a boat and 100 feet of boom already in place.  Recovery was started 
at 1 PM and will continue until we have the oil out of the creek.

Agencies notified at this time are:

Railroad Commission Region 6
TNRCC Region 5
National Response Center

I  do not know at this time how long the clean up will take, however I should 
have that information in the morning.  Will keep you up to date.

I will be at the site to do my environmental & safety thing.

Thanks,  Mr. Ed

Duane Hart has been offered opportunities at two other companies that provide 
compensation packages far more lucrative than anything EOTT can afford or 
justify at this time.

Last night I had dinner with another candidate, Nick Bednorz, VP and 
Controller of Coral Energy, that I would like you to meet.
Nick comes highly recommended by Stan Horton and Rod Hayslett.

Shelly will coordinate the meetings.

Rep. Greg Ganske yesterday introduced legislation to ban MTBE and promote

whatever legislation comes before the House Commerce Committee for a 
markup.   

As there have been a number of controversial issues to consider in the 
debate, the House Commerce and Senate Environment Commitees have both had 
difficulty settling on dates for their respective mark-ups of RFG 
legislation, but we do expect both to try to move forward in the coming 
months.

A copy of the legislation and Rep. Ganske's press release is attached.

NEWS RELEASE

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 16, 2000

Reps. Ganske and Shimkus Introduce Legislation to Ban MTBE and Promote Ethanol

Representatives Greg Ganske (R-IA) and John Shimkus (R-IL)today introduced 
the Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 to ban the gasoline additive 
methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and promote renewable ethanol.  They were 
joined on the bill by 21 other Members of
Congress.

MTBE and ethanol are added to gasoline to reduce harmful emissions. MTBE is 
responsible for widespread groundwater contamination. Ethanol, however, is a 
clean, renewable additive that does not contaminate water.

"We do not have to chose between clean air and clean water.  With renewable 
ethanol, not MTBE, we can have both," Ganske said.

"This bill clearly addresses the problem of MTBE contaminating water," Ganske 
said.  "Not only does it eliminate MTBE in gasoline within three years, it 
directs the EPA to help states figure out how to get this chemical out of 
their drinking water supplies."

"MTBE has caused the contamination of groundwater in sites around the 
country, including my District. However, there is a safe and clean 
alternative - ethanol," Shimkus said. "The Clean Air and Water Preservation 
Act will provide cleaner air by reducing harmful auto emissions and will 
provide cleaner water, as ethanol spillage does not contaminate
groundwater."

"The Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 gives refiners the 
flexibility they have sought within the Clean Air Act by allowing them to 
average their oxygen content," Ganske said.  "While giving them this 
flexibility, we have also raised the bar on environmental quality."

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required specific reductions in harmful 
emissions.  With oxygenated fuels in the Reformulated Gasoline Program, 
refiners have exceeded these requirements. The bill raises the standards to 
take into consideration these lower emissions levels, resetting the bar at a 
more environmentally sound level.

In promoting the bill, Ganske cited a USDA study of the agriculture impact of 
replacing MTBE with ethanol.  The study found that doing so would generate an 
extra $1 billion in on-farm cash receipts each year.  In addition, it would 
improve the price of corn by 14 cents per bushel each year for at least the 
next ten years.

"The Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 is a sensible environmental 
and agricultural bill," Ganske said.  "It is exceptionally important 
considering our farmers are entering their third year of depressed commodity 
prices and Congress last year appropriated billions in emergency farm 
support."

The Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 does the following:

* Bans MTBE within three years and urges refiners to replace it with ethanol.
* Requires labels be placed on all pumps dispensing MTBE-blended fuel.
* Directs EPA to provide technical guidelines to help states remove MTBE from 
water.
* Gives refiners flexibility to blend oxygen within the 2% requirement.
* Prohibits environmental backsliding by raising the standards on emissions 
reductions and prohibiting an increase in the use of gasoline aromatics 
(which can lead to cancer-causing particulate emissions).
* Directs DOE and EPA to look for alternative sources of gasoline oxygenates.


"Congress must make a commitment to environmental quality, renewable energy 
and American agriculture.  This bill does all three,"  Ganske said.  "It will 
help cleanup MTBE contaminated water supplies.  It will preserve the clean 
air accomplishments of the past decade.  And it will provide a renewable 
energy source which will decrease our dependence on foreign oil and improve 
our agricultural economy.  The Clean Air and Water Preservation
Act of 2000 is a good bill for all involved."

The information books should be in everyone's hands by about 8:30 Thursday 
morning.  Let me know if you have any trouble getting your copy.  Michael 
Ratner is now building a baseline economic model for each of the four (4) 
assets using data presented in the information memoranda.  Once the model 
works, we will be able to modify the data to run various cases for various 
asset combinations.  We need to identify all synergies and any other areas of 
special consideration that could impact our valuation (i.e. does ownership of 
Minnegasco provide any strategic opportunities, any value in the AC line 
access to northeast pipelines, etc.)  

You should soon receive another smaller packet from Merrill Lynch describing 
two different deal structures for our consideration - one is a "prepaid 
lease" arrangement, the other a "leveraged partnership". 

I am trying to set up a meeting with Robert Eichenroht to discuss PUHCA 
issues and how this deal would be impacted if we were to include either the 
Arkla LDC or Minnegasco package. 

Non-binding EOI's are due next Wednesday and time is short.  Bill Cordes will 
be in Houston next Tuesday and we have tentatively scheduled a group meeting 
for 8:00 AM.  [Location not yet confirmed, but we will try for a video conf. 
room so Omaha can participate.]  Please mark your calendars.

The following procedures have been developed by Walt, Mike and myself for the 
Environmental matters associated with the Texas New Mexico Pipeline System. 
Please pay special attention to Item No. 5 which is not only a change in 
procedure but also a huge cost savings to EOTT.   


We had a good visit last Thursday with the carrier.  The local representative 
and our New York claim representative were present.  We were told repeatedly 
that filing timely information and claim notification was required.  We 
tempered their nice but stern stance with their own internal issues regarding 
the change in our local representative.  All was friendly.  The bullet point 
review of the meeting's discussions is as follows and there are several 
procedural points that we will adopt going forward: 

Expense reporting on the known and unknown sites will be filed  monthly and 
the invoices will be provided also at that time.  ( providing the invoices 
with the report is a change in the procedure).  I believe that I will be able 
to pull the report information off of EMS Works going forward.  Please let me 
know who in the organization will be responsible for getting the invoices 
together so I can coordinate this process with them.
Invoices from our vendors need to be more descriptive.  Rich was in the 
meeting when this was discussed and I have asked him to take this matter up 
with our vendors.  In the field, if you see that the description is weak, ( 
for instance, "per work order") it would be helpful for you to contact the 
vendor then as opposed to sending it through the payment process.  If it is 
not descriptive enough to identify the work performed, payment will be 
delayed and claims processing will be slowed.  This enhancement would also 
seem to help us internally identify the expense.
When we are notified of a claim, be it land owner notification of an old 
site, or a new spill, a spill/claim report should be filed. I believe that 
this is the information that I will be receiving from EMS Works.  If it is an 
issue that requires special handling, I will be happy to take this 
information directly and outside the normal channels.  One area that will 
need to be addressed is an estimate of claim size with each report...and an 
update of that information as the claim matures if it changes materially.  I 
am not clear if this information will be available in EMS Works or not.  Can 
someone get back to me on this process?
As reports or correspondence from agencies/any third party are received, we 
will need to forward these on to the carrier for each claim that has been 
filed. Also, I will need to forward to the carrier any reports or 
correspondence that we submit to agencies and third parties. The carrier does 
not want to have to come to our offices to review files if it can be avoided 
and would prefer to process these claims as they mature.  As you forward 
these items to me for processing, please be sure that they are clearly 
identifiable as to the site/claim number.
Any new claim ( that would mean any unknown) will be noticed to the carrier.  
Before dispatching anyone from Entrix ( unless this is an emergency 
situation),  we will notice the carrier and they will authorize the 
investigation by Entrix or any other environmental consultant.  The carrier 
has the right to choose who they use, however Entrix is one of  their 
approved vendors.  I understand that Entrix charges us a fee for these 
investigations and this is a covered expense under the policy.  This will 
also aid in the processing of the claim as the carrier will accept their 
requested Entrix report as their own investigative report. These charges will 
be paid by the carrier, but they need to have the claim verified and then we 
need to have them dispatch Entrix to the site.  I also suspect that the fee 
that we have been charged by Entrix for these matters is in excess of the fee 
that the carrier pays.  Therefore it is even more critical that we have the 
carrier engage Entrix and pay them.  There are as I understand 38 task orders 
( estimated to be $10,000/each) currently outstanding with Entrix.  I have a 
copy of these and I would like to process these through the carrier where we 
have not already incurred any expense.  Who can visit with me on the actual 
status of any work performance under these orders?  We will need to calculate 
work performed and get immediate authorization from the carrier to have 
Entrix provide the service going forward for each site. 
Lawsuits and paper work will be noticed to me by Legal.  


As far as the action items on current updated claims: 

Roger Pennifill, the technical claim handler for AIG, was in our offices 
Thursday and Friday and with the assistance of Mike Kelly reviewed the files 
and talked with the field personnel as needed. 

The situation with Jimmie Cooper lawsuit is the top priority with the 
carrier.  Cynthia Green will get back to me within a day or so to give me 
feedback on the requests that we have made to authorize the fingerprinting of 
the crude oil in the Cooper's well.  This matter takes precedence over the 
filing an answer on the lawsuit.   Walt Zimmerman will work with Cynthia 
Green on the selection of counsel for this matter.  Unless the carrier tells 
us otherwise Paul Bohannon will continue to act as lead counsel for this 
matter.  Walt will provide Cynthia Green with resumes for Paul Bohannon and 
the local counsel that has been suggested.

The second highest priority is Jay Anthony.  We have given Cynthia and Roger 
a complete write up on this situation and they will be coming back to us to 
discuss the options that we have laid in front of them.  

All other claims that we discussed, will be handled as their official 
notification of a claim or an update as to the magnitude of the potential 
problem.  

In the area of site investigation (Example Clay Osborne), we will formally 
ask that Entrix be approved to do the necessary  investigative work.

EOTT's bylaws currently require that we have a Chairman of the Board.  As a 
result of amendments to the bylaws that were made in 1994, the duties of the 
Chairman of the Board are quite limited.  The bylaws provide that "the 
Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and 
of the Board of Directors.  The Chairman of the Board shall act as a liaison 
between the officers of the Corporation and the Board of Directors."

Ted Gaylord has advised that he no longer wishes to serve as Board Chairman, 
although he does intend to remain on the Board.  There appear to be no other 
changes.  Suggest the four of us discuss the " Board Chairman"  situation as 
soon as possible. I have a call into Baird to explore (1) whether we need a 
Board Chairman per se, and (2) whether there will be any "disclosure" issues 
around Ted stepping down as Board Chairman.  SWD

I would like to see a draft today.

Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors 
meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect 
EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent 
that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.

Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the 
Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.

Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the 
Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the 
outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on 
EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the 
outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued 
service.

Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you 
would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on 
last year's "annual meeting" agenda.

Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

Albeit this is not an excuse for my tardiness, I stopped on this subject to 
review some changes that the SEC  has made with regard to the Audit 
Committee rules, charter and heightened attention on the liability issues 
surrounding this committee.  First of all, I checked  with Erlene Kindle in 
Risk management  ( we share that policy under Enron's coverage) and confirmed 
that the restrictions within our policy should not give concern to our 
committee members.  Also the policy was just recently renewed and is good for 
three years.  This at least allows this issue to be well flushed out by the 
time a renewal would come into discussion.  Even with these assurances 
however, I will be recommending that we increase our Audit committee fees in 
recognition of the serious role that this committee plays within the 
organization and the serious message that the SEC is trying to send on this 
subject.

Recommendation:

Service as a member of Board by an Outside Director:
I would increase the flat fee  to $16,000/year ( from $15,000) and increase 
the attendance fee to $2,000  per meeting ( from $1,000).  I personally put 
weight on the attendance/active director role.   I would leave that $5,000 
bonus in place should the position be filled by a non-employee director.  

Service as a member of the Audit Committee by an Outside Director:
I would pay a flat fee for Audit committee membership of $4,000/year ( 
currently none), to appropriately recognize the responsibility of that 
membership and pay $1,000 per meeting attended ( current rate).

I would not recommend that we establish the flat fee for other committee 
memberships ( currently the only other committee is the Compensation 
Committee) and leave that open as to the level of responsibility that the 
committee would undertake. 

The difference per membership is as follows :( based on 4 meeting per year 
for both the Board and Audit) 

Currently  Board Membership, full attendance:  $19,000/year    $24,000/year 
for Chairman if outside
                    Audit Membership, full attendance:    $4,000/year

Proposed:  Board Membership, full attendance:  $24,000/year    $29,000/year 
for Chairman if outside
                       Audit Committee, full attendance:         $8,000/year

If you have any specific questions please let me know.

Stan, Bill, Jim & Jim,
Attached is the letter sent to Chairman Hoecker regarding the use of his
facilities on April 26 for the industry meeting facilitated by GISB for
governance issues for a standards organization for wholesale and retail gas
and electric issues.  The draft was sent to his staff on March 30 to ensure
that the letter said the necessary things, and we learned yesterday afternoon
that we would have access to the Commission Room and that Chairman Hoecker
would open the meeting.  Jim Templeton was working with Pat Wood (Texas PUC
Chairman) who originally said he would also like to make opening remarks for
the meeting.  Best Regards,  Rae

Stan,

Thanks for the fax from Mike McGrath.  The only structure issue that I need
some further clarification on is electric retail vs. wholesale.  To the
extent GISB moves in the direction of retail gas standards, would we
consider the same split?  I must admit that it seems overly cautious in
terms of avoiding one sector driving another.  Balanced voting, super
majority rules, etc. would avoid the need for three or possibly four units
under the EISB umbrella.  Pipelines have been willing to live with other
segments having a voice in wholesale gas standards based on the balanced
structure and vote rights established when the organization was created.  If
you can shed more light on this I would appreciate your thoughts.

Ron

This morning, Cutty informed Bill Thacker that Cutty was leaving TEPPCO to 
join
EOTT on Feb 2, 2000.  Reportedly Bill was stunned and not very happy about
Cutty's leaving.  Thacker asked that we wait until tomorrow to announce this
development as he is "trying to determine what to tell TEPPCO troops."

Mary Ellen will you prepare an announcement for me to send out tomorrow that
announces:
1.  The hiring of Cutty
2.   The new role of Operations Governance
3.  The reporting  relationships of the District managers
4.  The leaving of AL Hugh
5.  The combination of the South Texas and West Tex/ New Mexico regions
6.  The new roles of John Oveson and Robin Border

thanks, mike

Stan, I just want to go on record to tell you how much respect I have for you 
as an individual and as a highly accomplished 
executive.  You have handled this current situation extremely professionally 
while also exhibiting a considerable amount of understanding and compassion.  
It is easy to see why Ken, Jeff and Joe hold you in such high regard.

  All of the management of EOTT is benefiting from your leadership and 
business acumen.  I am absolutely convinced that EOTT is going to reach it's 
full potential in the not too distant future.

Thanks for all that you have done and are doing!  mike

 This project was presented to Stan Horton, NBP and EOT this morning and we 
received the go ahead by Stan to submit a non-binding offer in on Monday.  
The major change that occurred was that EOTT, not NBP, will submit the 
offer.  Basically two reasons account for this change; 1) NBP expressed 
concerns about this new business and their limited knowledge related to the 
commercial and environmental issues and 2) when petrochemicals was pulled out 
the size of the deal became managable to EOTT's balance sheet.  We will now 
be in the process of marking our changes to the purchase and sale agreement 
with plans to submit it and our indication of value on Monday.
 If the offer we submit is acceptable , we will enter into the next phase 
(along with at least one other buyer) and should be provided the information 
needed to finalize our bid and contract by March 15.  I'm hoping that we have 
access to the information we have been requesting.  As we enter into this 
next phase and given EOTT's new role ( as a Buyer versus providing commercial 
support), I'm expecting that personnel from EOTT will be involved in their 
areas of expertise and will be requesting your assistances in coming up to 
speed in a hurry.  I know that Northern Border has appreciated the effort put 
in to date and I know I have.  I hope we pass the next hurdle and get asked 
in next week .
 I just wanted to keep you informed and express my appreciation for your 
efforts.

Stan - FYI, we (Ron, John, Rod, Saeed and Dwight) had a great meeting today 
with PWC to discuss getting a better handle on both the operating synergies 
and growth potential for a combination pipes/wires Transco.  They had a very 
good outline of how to move forward at a 50,000 foot level, which is 
appropriate for our next meetings on 2/1/ and 2/4.  The action items 
resulting were as follows:

ENE to provide PWC w/ basic data download from our work in progress 
(assumptions we've used for the IOU's assets, GPG public data, shell models, 
etc.) (1/21)
PWC to provide ENE cost to complete study prior to 2/1 and 2/4 meetings (1/21)
PWC to provide ENE a template for evaluating each of the synergies we 
mutually agreed need focusing on now. (1/24)
PWC to provide ENE a similar template for the various growth prospects 
discussed (1/24)
Initial follow up meeting (same participants from ENE) on Monday, 1/24 to 
begin rationalizing the data and quantifying the numbers.
Rough draft of study due before 2/1 meeting.
Final draft prior to 2/4 meeting.

As always, call if any questions.

RANDY

Joe R. will be sending out something in greater detail shortly, but it 
appears that Equilon's management would like to pursue a deal with us on an 
exclusive basis and that this decision is being forwarded to the Equilon 
Board for approval.  If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get 
organized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, 
but one thing we should start thinking about now is the "disclosure" issue.

If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this 
transaction , Equilon will probably want  to sign a memorandum of 
understanding with us, and this may put us in a "disclosure" posture because 
at that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a 
closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past 
dealings with these people).  Even without a signed document, the 
"size/probability" test would still be an issue for us to deal with.  
Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's 
Board. Thanks.   SWD

 Yesterday, EOTT submitted a non-binding bid for the stock of APL along with 
our comments on the stock purchase agreement.  Copies of both are attached 
for your review.  The offer price has been removed from the letter.  We 
haven't heard anything form the invesment bankers but did receive two faxes 
late last night.  The first was the receipt of the disclosure schedules.  The 
second was the waiver by Phillips of their ROFR on Seaway for the year 2000.  
This simplies the transaction immensely.
 I keep you informed of any news but wanted to extend my appreciation to 
everyone for their hard work during this process and the transition from 
Northern Border as a buyer to EOTT.
 thanks

This adds a significant complication to our option of lining the #1 10" line 
with polyethylene.  Ronny, Rick and I will review this and try to talk 
directly to Fred Joyner, the DOT Region Chief.

		 Subject: Polyethylene liner in steel pipe

Per my action step from the meeting with Dana Gibbs and Dan Cole, I have 
contacted the Atlanta region of DOT.  I inquired about their take on the 
potential for installing a polyethylene liner in an existing steel pipe, at 
least as it relates to existing DOT regulations.   The Region Chief, Fred 
Joyner, was not in so I visited with a senior inspector. (I am in Midland, my 
notes in Houston and his name escapes me at the moment.)
 
Here is my understanding of the situation:
1. A waiver would be required.  
2. If the PE liner depends on the steel pipe for some of its strength, tests 
and study results would probably have to be submitted to DOT for their 
approval, before a waiver would be granted.  
3.  A liner not dependent on the steel pipe for strength could possibly be 
approved in 3-4 weeks.
4. I found four waivers that have been issued to date, one for Koch (now 
EOTT), one for Sun (now EOTT), and a couple of others.  All were for small 
diameter gathering lines that became jurisdictional by virture of their 
location.  No mention of a pipe liner in liquids service was found or 
referenced.  

 I will try another region, or perhaps Richard Sanders at TSI, on Friday.

In my judgment we are in uncharted water.  We can step out and take a risk 
(from a regulatory perspective) or we can try to bring the regulators on 
board using the "new and better technology" virtures of the liner.  In this 
scenario i believe the fluted liner would have a special appeal to them.  My 
thinking is that making them a partner in the application of new technology 
would hasten the approval process.  This type of liner meets the dual wall 
pipe concept so popular with the industry detractors of today.  Maybe, just 
maybe, in certain cases, it is a viable answer to that demand.  However, it 
is not the panacea that some would like.  Bottom line, I think perhaps a 
meeting with some DOT brass and the SE Region Chief would be appropriate.  We 
could have our vendor of choice present facts, figures and test results at 
that time.  I also believe the liner vendors have a tremendous vested 
interest in the outcome of this project.  This may be a factor in vendor 
selection, in that we want someone who offers well designed and tested 
product that can be supported in a professional manner.

As you can see by the attached memo, we have slightly diffferent
interpretations of what the committee members agreed to.  However, the
direction is still positive.

Waters,
I see the problem - my address is mmcgrath@eei.org - not kmcgrath. Sorry
about that - it was misprinted in a ubp list some time back, and has
haunted me ever since.

Also - be advised we do not yet support the EISB option - we only agree to
find acceptable organizational solutions - which could be an EISB.  If we
jump to EISB at the outset folks will resist.  Let's not introduce that
concept until there is support for it.  I can assure you there will be
resistance to creating another wholesale rule writing group - homework must
be done.

Thanks for your help
  -Mike

Stan,
I plan to participate on tomorrow's conference call on your behalf. 

I met with Rae earlier today and had a quick preview of this document.  The 
crux of the recommendation is that Rae would like to take a procedural vote 
at the March 2 Board meeting on whether the Board intends to move forward 
with pursuing retail standards.

If the procedural vote is "yes," then she is proposing to have Jay Costan and 
Bill Boswell start drafting the governance documents.  I mentioned that I 
would like to participate in reviewing the Bylaws and Certificate as your 
representative.

I think that the attached backround and Feb. 14 meeting summary is fine.  I 
have lots of thoughts on the possible organizational structure document -- 
but these are probably best saved until the Board votes on its intentions.  
I'd say the procedural vote is too close to call at this point.   Rae reports 
that Warren Mitchell of SoCal Gas, Reliant, End-Users and a number of state 
commissioners are firmly behind moving forward.

Stan,
          Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether 
Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales 
channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing 
services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew 
Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other 
possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with 
him when you are in the UK.

I have another meeting with Phil Clark (EDS) on Wednesday, 3/8.  According to 
Steve, who will probably not be at this meeting since his name is now on the 
"official list", these are the outstanding items:

I have offiered $5000 finders fee per person, Phil would like more.  Our 
economic analysis assumed a $10k finders fee, so we are still within that 
limit.
EDS definitely wants the contract minimums for 2001 and 2002 increased.  I 
will offer $8mm for both years, an increase of $2mm in 2001 and $3mm in 
2002.  Again, I want to stress to them that they must EARN this additional 
work.  I am still playing phone tag with Ken Stott on this to see what Azurix 
plans for 2001 and 2002.  

Our orginal plan, which was quite agressive, targeted 4/1 as the transition 
date.  GIven that we are in the second week of March, I think a more 
realistic timeline for transition is 5/1.  This means the employee offers 
should be out no later than 4/1, with a yes/no answer back by 4/15.  Then 
actual transition of the "yes" employees will take place effective 5/1.  I 
think our initial "yes" response will be at 75%, but by the time 4/15 hits, 
that amount will be 90-95%.  In discussions with Steve, he thinks this is a 
realistic guess.

So, the next steps include:
Finishing up negotiations with EDS/Phil Clark.
Start developing a transition workplan/communication plan with HR (Robert 
Jones and Ben Herman).

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I'll provide another update 
after my meeting on Wednesday.

Thanks.   Jenny

As of this morning, we have not yet received a response from the Navajo 
Nation.  Also, per my follow up conversations with Larry Ruzow after the 
conference call on Wednesday, it appears that at least 3 task force members 
--one council member, the Task Force Chairman and the liaison between the 
Task Force and the President's office --will not be available for Tuesday's

Stan,
It seems that the gas pipeline industry and the liquid  industry may
not agree on an approach to the pipeline safety reauthorization bill and a 
rule
making that is being issued concerning pipeline integrity testing. We admit 
that
the liquid industry is "under the gun" to some degree due to the tragic 
incident
at Bellingham last year, and that there is some spillover to the gas side as a
result. However, we think that it is in our interest and the time is right for
us to get something done in this Congress and that we need to "be for 
something"
that is workable and will also pass.  So we're not for a bill at all costs, 
but
we are willing to work with Rich Felder and the others at OPS to get to
something we can live with. The integrity rule making will only apply to 
liquids
in the first phase and we think we should not oppose this attempt.
We have heard that INGAA may try to kill the reauthorization bill; I don't 
know
if that's true or not, but AOPL is urging them not to panic and see what can 
be
worked out. I'll give you a call later next week to tell you exactly where we
are after I talk to Ben Cooper, Executive Director of AOPL in Washington.

In reviewing the key items of your business review with Jeff Skilling, he had 
some issues with your new Broadband business.  Please provide me with some 
more detail as follows:

It was mentioned that we had spent around $13 million thus far on dark 
fiber.  How much of the resultant capacity has been sold?  Are we laying the 
dark fiber at risk?  In other words are we taking a long position in dark 
fiber.  What is our capacity situation today?

Do you have a business plan for this new venture..ie what is the anticipated 
capital expenditures annually for this venture.  Who are the customers?  What 
is the expected return?  What is the payback on our investment, etc.

Who approved the formation of this new venture and the capital commitment?

Anything else that will help me get a clear understanding of what we have and 
where we are going with it.

Dear Officers,

Hines, the building management team, has offered to move us at no charge to
space on the 36th floor of our building.  The move itself will cost Hines an
estimated $87,000 -- for construction of the space, moving fees,
telecommunications setup and office materials.  Our lease for this new space
would run through May 2002 at our current rate.

They will give us the option to now sign a lease extension from May 2002 to
May 2005 at a base rate of no more than $20.50 per square foot.  We have
checked with several corporate real estate facilities departments (Enron, El
Paso, Dynegy) with the general consensus reached that this is clearly a
financial advantage for us.

Should we not take this offer,  Cinergy will assume our space at the end of
our lease.  We will be responsible for our own move (a considerable expense),
and after the move will be responsible for a higher lease rate, assuming we
stay in the downtown Houston area.  In the meantime, we will be placed in the
middle of Cinergy's construction on our floor.

All things considered, I advise that we do agree to the move, which can be
accomplished over a weekend with little disruption to our office.    Please
let me know if you concur or have concerns.

Best Regards,  Rae

Dear officers,

    We have been approached by Hines, our building landlord, asking us if we
would consider moving.  Cinergy -- the only other tenant on our floor, have
asked for our space.  Our lease runs through to April 2002, for 2455 square
feet of space.  Hines noted that all moving expenses (upwards of $50,000)
would be covered.  In addition, they indicated our lease might be extended to
the end of 2004 at our current rate of $6.00 base per square foot and $8.50
add on for utilities and maintenance per square foot, for a total of $14.50
per square foot.  This is an advantageous rate as it was negotiated prior to
downtown becoming so populated.  We confirmed with commercial real estate
agents that average rates for downtown space "A Buildings" now are
considerably higher, in the neighborhood of $22 to $30 per square foot and
more if we were located in the Galleria area.  Our building is considered an
"A Building."

    There is other space in the building that is better laid out, and would
accommodate expansion, if needed.  We are still in the discussion stages --
but it looks like a financially favorable arrangement if everything can be
worked out.  We would be able to move over a weekend, have little or no
disruption of service, maintain the same phone numbers, still be in the same
building -- have more possibilities for expansion if needed, and maintain the
same low rate for a longer period of time.  The space they have offered is
2500 square feet but at our current monthly rental rates.

    We should be able to sublease the space with little difficulty, in the
event a new organization comes into being and our location and office is not
appropriate for the new organization.  Looks like lots of advantages and very
few risks.

    If we stay where we are, our lease runs out in April 2002 in which event
we will probably be required to move and we will spend upwards of $50,000 to
make such a move and be faced with higher per square foot rental costs.
Meanwhile, Cinergy is planning to reconstruct our floor and our office will
be in the middle of construction activity for some time.

    The conversations are in the early stages, and I'll keep you informed as
they go. Let me know if you have any concerns with  this approach.

Best Regards,  Rae

The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of 
Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested 
groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.

Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences 
between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of 
similarities."   GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by 
the end of January.  
GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two 
proposals which have been advanced thus far.

Stan,

Having circulated the attached meeting summary, action steps, and principles 
to the group, and having heard only affirmative comment, I believe we will 
use the attached as the go forward plan for our CEO meeting.

It is right in line with our earlier discussion.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.  I'll be out of 
the country 6/1-6/6.  It would be most appreciated if someone would advise me 
of GISB Board actions as soon as they occur.

Thanks
  -Mike

I am preparing for Mike Burke's signature resignation notices that provide 
for his resignation as an officer of various EOTT entities.  Mary Ellen 
Coombe has advised me that Mike will also be resigning from EOTT's Board of 
Directors, so his resignation notice for EOTT Energy Corp.  will provide that 
he is resigning as a director and as President and Chief Executive Officer of 
EOTT Energy Corp.

Mike's resignation from EOTT's Board of Directors creates a vacancy on the 
Board.  We have two (2) options.  EOTT's Board of Directors can either (a) 
appoint someone to fill Mike's unexpired term or (b) reduce the number of 
directors to six.   I will be preparing a unanimous consent for the EOTT 
Board to sign which provides for the designation of Stan as Chief Executive 
Officer and the election of Dana as President and Chief Operating Officer.  
If possible, I would like to cover the issue of the vacancy on the EOTT 
Board  in the same unanimous consent.

Please give me your thoughts on this "vacancy issue."

CONFIDENTIAL/ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Stan:

 I have given considerable thought to the issue you raised in the
meeting on June 15 -- that is, whether the amount of Available Cash for the
fourth quarter of 1999 could be recomputed so that the issuance of APIs for
that quarter could be rescinded.  My delay in getting back to you was
occasioned by the fact that I went on vacation shortly after that meeting
and just returned to work yesterday.

 The reason the question is worth exploring is this --- Enron Corp.
has certain rights under its support agreement with EOTT, and it is entitled
to exercise those rights notwithstanding the fact that it also has a
fiduciary duty as a controlling shareholder.  I approached the question
solely as counsel for Enron and from the standpoint of evaluating the merits
of any claim that Enron could make that the API issuance should be
rescinded.  From that standpoint it is no different from asking: if EOTT
were dealing with an unrelated third party would that third party have a
claim for rescission?  Unfortunately, based on the facts as I understand
them, I have been unable to formulate a claim that has sufficient merit to
be worthy of assertion, as explained below.

 The computation of Available Cash for any quarter is based on (a)
cash receipts and disbursements and (b) increases or reductions in cash
reserves, which the General Partner "determines in its reasonable discretion
to be necessary or appropriate."  Thus, the question is whether there is a
basis for recomputing the cash receipts or the reserves for the fourth
quarter.

 Cash Receipts.  I would think there may well be a valid claim in a
situation in which EOTT made a mistake in its calculations of cash receipts
or disbursements, even if that mistake was discovered several months later.
It is my understanding, however, that the scrub-down of the books for the
fourth quarter turned up only immaterial discrepancies from the amounts that
had been calculated for the fourth quarter in mid-February, when the
distribution of Available Cash for the quarter was made.  Thus, I am aware
of no meritorious argument that Enron is entitled to rescission because of
EOTT's mistakes in calculating its cash receipts or disbursements for the
quarter.   That being the case, the only other issue that is worth focusing
on is the reserves.

  Reserves.  The only component of the reserves that I am aware of
that is large enough to bear scrutiny is the theft-related insurance item.
There were no cash receipts from the insurance prior to the distribution, so
any claim for rescission must focus on the amount of reserves for the fourth
quarter.  If the level of reserves was determined in a manner that was not
consistent with the "reasonable discretion" standard set forth in the
partnership agreement, Enron would have a valid claim for rescission.
Presumably had the General Partner known in mid-February that insurance
would cover the $3 million loss (other than the $500,000 deductible), it
would have reduced reserves by $2.5 million (either by setting aside less in
reserves or releasing reserves established in prior quarters), which would
have produced $2.5 million of additional Available Cash.  In that case there
would not have been any APIs required.  Is there a basis for a claim that
the General Partner did not use "reasonable discretion" when it established
the level of reserves?  Based on the facts as I understand them, I have been
unable to come up with a good argument that the General Partner was not
using its "reasonable discretion" in making the determination it made.   It
is my understanding that, although at the time the General Partner was aware
that it had theft insurance, it did not know whether the insurance would
cover the entire $3 million loss or merely the $800,000 in fair market value
of the product at the time of the theft (less the $500,000 deductible).  I
also understand that the insurance carrier had not admitted liability at
that time, so there was some question whether there would be any insurance
proceeds.  Thus, it seems it would be very difficult to establish that the
General Partner did not use its reasonable discretion.

 The partnership agreement makes it clear that the amount of
Available Cash is to be computed based on (a) actual receipts and
disbursements during the quarter and (b) distributions from the operating
partnerships and reserves established, or changes in reserves, that in each
case occur prior to the "date on which the Partnership makes its
distribution of Available Cash in respect of such quarter."  Thus, the
partnership agreement leaves no room for going back and redoing reserves
based on events that occur after the distribution for the quarter.

 Please call if you have any questions about this analysis or if you
think I do not have my facts straight or need additional facts.  You can
reach me at 713/758-2414.

Stan, Thank you for including Dana and me in you Strategic Briefing session 
today.  We both found it to be of considerable value.  Dana and I are already 
kicking around some ideas on how we can think about EOTT's future 
profitability growth in 
a much bolder, creative and innovative manner.  One of our approaches will be 
to add a couple of individuals to our team that will assist us in identifying 
unique opportunities and new approaches to our business.  We will keep you 
apprised of the specifics of this initiative.

Last week we opened up the analysis of several more acquisitions.  Included 
in this group is a joint offer with ENA to acquire a 50% interest in an 
existing small CO2 business in West Texas and a  50% interest in a grassroots 
CO2 project in Wyoming.   Total initial investment for NBP would be about $28 
million.  This deal can go forward on its own if the Seller accepts the 
offer, or it can be brought into Project 20/20 if that deal closes.

FYI -
I discussed the increase in EOTT's unit price (up 11/16 on relatively normal 
volume of 32,200 units at 2:00 CST) with Frank Delaney of Spear, Leads.  He 
indicated Merrill Lynch has an order to buy 15,000 units with a 13 3/4 limit 
and Golman Sachs has an order to buy 80,000 units with a 13 bid.  This is 
obviously very good news and probably indicates at least a couple S 
Corp.-type buyers are beginning to accumulate sizable positions.

Please keep this information confidential.

Scott

I had lunch yesterday with the Natural Resources Commodities Group from 
Standard Chartered Bank as I had indicated to you earlier.  I addressed with 
them our desire to potentially use the facility that they give us as a bridge 
loan in the event we were to purchase assets in the range of $75-90,000,000.  
Even though this is not a committed facility, I ask that they give us their 
assurance that this facility was not in jeopardy and that they bank was 
pleased with the line and line of business.  They were able to give me that 
assurance, and in fact had planned on asking for more business at the lunch.  
This group is the commodities arm of the bank and the natural resources group 
produces over 75% of the revenue stream for the entire group.  They are 
currently at 60% in excess of their budget for year 2000.  This is important 
because banks generally do not cut off strong revenue generating arms.  

There are global issues, as they calculate exposure to us into the total 
exposure that they give to Enron companies ( not supported by Enron, but they 
look at their internal exposure in the aggregate).  Standard Chartered just 
bought the Grindlays bank in India and of course there well be added exposure 
there.  They plan on revising their limits to accommodate that and did not 
feel that this hinder our line in anyway.  They also stated that in the event 
that the market went contango in the interim, they would entertain a short 
term increase over the current limits if it was needed.  

as a reminder the limits are:  $150,000,000 in inventory financing L+ .55 - 
.75
                                          $100,000,000 in account receivable 
sales L + .85

bear in mind however the collateral must be available in order to access 
these lines.

Rae, I think that is too strong for our purposes.  Here is my redraft:

     RESOLVED, that the Board of Directors endorses the efforts undertaken at
its behest since the December 1999 meeting to determine the level of interest
in, and whether and how GISB should expand its focus to address electric and 
gas
wholesale and retail standards, and

     Further RESOLVED, that the Board directs its officers and the task force
established in December 1999 to continue meeting with interested parties to
gather their input and financial and other support, and to prepare drafts of 
the
documents necessary to effectuate any required structural changes, should the
Board determine to put them into effect, and

     Further RESOLVED, that the officers and task force shall report back to 
the
Board at its June 2000 meeting regarding their activities and progress.

We just received the proposed Confidentiality Agreement for the Reliant asset 
disposition to be handled by Merrill Lynch.
The package will include Reliant Gas Transmission (used to be the NorAm 
system), the gathering facilities upstream of 
RGT, Mississippi River Transmission, Minnegasco, and the Ark-La LDC assets 
(does NOT include Entex).  No details
yet on transaction timing, preferred bid structure, etc.  however, I believe 
that bids for all, or any part of the package are OK.

Legal is now reviewing the CA.  The Information Packets will be forwarded to 
us as soon as it is signed. 

More to follow.

Stan,

Thanks for your email and we may take you up on your offer to help at some
point.

Also, I'm glad you let me know that you/Enron are interested in investment
opportunities.  My investment focus is exclusively on business-to-business
e-commerce and technology companies which are currently pretty good places
to invest.  We will be raising a new fund hopefully next year...I'll keep
you posted.  Also, I come across attractive early stage deals which our fund
is not set up to handle.  When I do, I set up an LLC and get some people to
kick in (Frevert and Rice came in on the last deal), so if that is of
interest I'll keep you in mind.

Talk to you soon,

Dave

Attached is list of the outstanding insurance claims provided to us by Risk 
Management.  As I indicated to Rod yesterday, I have been informed that the 
premiums that were paid this year were $15,000,000 and given the claims 
submitted at $43,000,000, Corp is looking for a way to mitigate anticipated 
rising premium costs.   They are looking very hard at Hawkin's Audit Program 
to help them out.  As this list indicates, International assets should bear 
the brunt of future costs.  The Transwestern train derailment will be about 
$700,000 ($200k for repair and $500k for buisness interruption), both of 
which will ulitmately be reimbursed by the railroad.

Joe, per our discussions, here are some items we want to be sure to 
cover/assign in our initial due diligence check list:

1. Purchase And Sale Agreement  preparation and negotiation (using Rodeo PSA 
as template since Equilon is already familiar with said document, which was 
highly negotiated).  This effort will include any needed side agreements.

2.  Review any "corporate" or "partnership" ownership issues affecting any 
pipelines or segments within the assets.

3.   Review of rights-of-way, easements, real property licenses, fees lands, 
leaseholds and other real property interests comprising the assets (explore 
possibility of obtaining help from ROW people within GPG).  Analysis must 
include right-to-assign and no-conversion- of- 
common-carrier-assets-to-private-use issues, as well as other standard 
issues, including telecommunication rights, etc.

4.   Physical inspection of real and personal property in the deal for 
safety/environmental/operating issues.

5.   Tariff/FERC/regulatory/property tax issues affecting the assets.  (Need 
to be sure that assets have been properly listed & reported to taxing 
authorities.  Need to "assume" existing tariffs where required.)

6.  HSR (antitrust)  and "shop closing" issues.  SEC disclosure issues, and 
relationship b/w Phoenix and Koch S-1.

7.  Employee/benefit/organized labor issues (three unions/collective 
bargaining agreements involved).

8.  Existing commercial contracts and "shipper" issues.  Any long-term or 
"out- of- the- money" situations?

9.  Any outstanding claims, assessments, levies, penalties,  protests or 
litigation (both environmental and non-environmental).

10. Completion of any remaining business due diligence needed to 
confirm/justify purchase price.

11.  Environmental review---with emphasis on "pricing" existing enviro 
matters we would be assuming/undertaking.

12.   UCC lien search and any bulk sales issues.


Of course, the list above is just for openers.  There are a number of things 
I have undoubtedly missed.  We have our standard check list that we use on 
these deals, and I know you will have a number of additional items you will 
want to include in the overall list.  We should probably compare notes on the 
initial master list before the "kick-off" meeting on 7/26.  Thanks.  SWD

Stan,
We had our board meeting last week.  It worked out the way we hoped it 
would.  Results:

1.  Our CEO UBP Task Force will continue to work with your new team, 
discussing matters such as principles, scope, governance, organization, etc.

2.  Each of our CEO Policy Committees (Energy Services, Supply, and Delivery) 
will provide commentary on the principles, scope, governance, organization, 
etc.

3.  Progress report to board in September.

I am going to work up a plan for getting much of #2 done before the September 
board meeting, so that we can develop some rough proactive overall position 
on wholesale before December.  Can't make promises yet.

It would be most helpful to me if I could give concrete examples about new 
uniform practices can be a win-win in wholesale markets.  Do you know of any 
examples we can use of practices that we really wish we already had?  I'm 
sure somebody in GISB has a wish list.  We had such a list when we started 
the retail effort,  much of it came from CUBR.  It is useful in helping 
people understand what we are talking about.  I can use it as a "for 
instance".

Thanks
  -Mike

After my discussion with Cutty today, I think any discussion of the 
organization should wait until we have a plan for the operations group based 
upon our meeting tomorrow.  I plan to have the conceptual discussion with in 
the staff meeting tomorrow had show the attached chart without the suggested 
reporting shown on the chart.  My thoughts are that we need to focus on our 
key business drivers and  develop the organization around these thoughts.  I 
have listed the key business drivers as 1) Crude Oil Marketing and Trading, 
2) Crude Oil Pipelines and 3) Cash Management due to our MLP format.

I have reflected the organization on the attached chart which is preliminary 
and has not yet been shown to anyone other than via this memo.  The specifics 
of the operational group has not been defined pending the outcome of 
tomorrows discussion.  I have held discussions with those groups that are 
spread across more than one  business and have ask them to define their 
organization using the concept above.  All activities that do not directly 
effect one of the three business drivers needs to be reviewed for importance 
and priority.

I do have some concerns that must be addressed and still need some input.

Subject: NBP Project 20/20


Dave, as I described in my voice mail I am sending you by Federal Express, a 
proposal by the ENA (Denver) employees (who NBP hopes to recruit) covering 
their compensation after they come over to manage the Wyoming assets being 
acquired in Project 20/20 from ENA.  Specifically, I believe our mutual 
objective is to see that the ENA employees who are about to become GPG 
employees are compensated in a similar manner and at the same levels as they 
were when they were employees of ENA.    Could you use your HR contacts at 
ENA to confirm that this proposal (see page 4 of the FEDEX package) is how 
they were compensated at ENA ?  Any other advice you can give us on this 
question will be appreciated. We are being asked to negotiate these terms up 
front as an inducement to get the ENA folks to jump on the GPG bandwagon.  
This negotiation will be going strong next week, so your help will be needed 
soon.   Please give me a call as I am sure you will have questions on this.

Louie:  Not particularly surprising.  There remains the concern that the 
Nation has  not waived its immunity from suit even in tribal court.  I wonder 
if they would discuss that (they have refused in the recent past).  If they 
don't, that would leave us with:  (1) the Department of the Interior, with 
respect to certain disputes arising under the ROW agreement--particularly on 
issues of cancellation; and (2) an "ex Parte Young" action in federal court 
for injunction against tribal officials seeking to enjoin acts in excess of 
tribal power under federal law--with the possible result that the federal 
court requires us to exhaust tribal court remedies before it hears the 
issues.  This would help only in egregious circumstances or when the Nation 
exceeds its jurisdictional power.  If TW agrees to the standard terms and 
conditions, it will be tough to show the Nation is exceeding its powers, 
since they require consent to broad tribal powers.

Please raise any questions.  Lynn

Larry Ruzow met with the Navajo DOJ (a Jim Fitting, Esq. ) yesterday
afternoon on another matter.  In the course of the meeting,
Mr. Fitting made clear that the DOJ will oppose any deal that calls for
disputes to be adjudicated in any
forum other than the Navajo Nation Courts (and that this meant DOJ
opposition to arbitration as well.)

Larry expressed that we should not expect Ms. Tapahe (who is more militant
on sovereignty-related
issues) to be willing to compromise on forum issues.

He did remind me of the Resources Committee process.

At this point we will attempt a meeting regardless and report back on
progress.

Subject: Impact of OPEC Target Change on Probable Resid Price Range

OPEC, "coaxed" by Saudi Arabia, have announced a revised target of $25/bbl 
for WTI.  The Saudis have even agreed to help out Venezuela financially in 
order to keep them from opening the spigot and dropping the price.

At the low end of the old OPEC target range of $18 to 22/bbl for WTI, Gulf 
Coast 1% S prices in the low two dollars per mmbtu range would have been in 
the range of reasonable probability.  

The resid expectations at the low, target and high end of the WTI range are 
as follows:

    GC 1%S Range, $/mmbtu
         

With the new target, in all likelihood, GC 1% Sulfur would only rarely go 
below $2.50/mmbtu.

    GC 1%S Range, $/mmbtu

Cynthia and I met with Bob Gee regarding a potential role for DOE in creating 
a national standards board.  Bob appeared comfortable with establishing a 
"Blue Ribbon" panel, similar to the reliability panel, to address this 
issue.  In fact, Bob suggested that the reliability panel, which includes a 
balance of key stakeholders, could be re-tasked with this issue.

We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure 
(governance, segments, executive committees) and scope of the organization 
(retail, wholesale, gas, electric).  Bob plans to follow-up with us next week.

Dear Editorial Review Board,

At the last EC meeting, the EC voted to send a report to the FERC regarding
the issue of cross contract ranking.  Cross contract ranking was an action
item in the 1999 annual plan that after much debate failed at the EC, so the
recommended standards were never adopted. The recommended standards failed
because the EC was unable to form a consensus around the work product.
Normally, this voting failure would be seen as evidence that the industry was
not ready for such standards as a consensus could not be built for them.

Some Commission staff  has contacted some of the EC members to better
understand why these recommended standards were not adopted.  All minutes of
the meetings and work products are posted on the home page, accessible to any
interested party.  Because of the calls made and the repeated review at the
EC (November, February and April),  some EC members proposed that a letter be
sent to the FERC and voted on specific language, which is included in the
letter.  Care was taken that the language not be misconstrued as advocacy.

Please let me know if you would like a conference call on this matter, or if
you have any comments on the attached draft.  The EC is aware that the
Editorial Review Board must approve all written communications of this type.
Typical communications with the FERC take the form of a status report, so
this is somewhat unusual.

I look forward to your responses -- Best Regards, Rae

FYI - info on the recent lawsuit filed by the Oxygenated Fuels Association in 
NY against the state's law banning MTBE.   I will forward information by fax 
that includes more details and talking points from OFA.

Industry group challenges state's MTBE ban

by JOEL STASHENKO
Associated Press Writer

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Charging the governor and state Legislature with
political pandering, an industry group said Wednesday it is challenging New
York's ban on the gasoline additive MTBE.

The Oxygenated Fuels Association said it filed a federal court suit Tuesday
in Albany calling for the first-in-the-nation state law phasing out the use
of MTBE by 2004 be declared invalid.

The association, an Arlington, Va.-based coalition of MTBE manufacturers,
said New York and every other state is prohibited from unilaterally imposing
regulations on the use of additives which are more stringent than those set
by Congress and the president in the Clean Air Act.

The state's MTBE ban is such a law, the suit argues.

Methyl tertiary-butyl ether increases oxygen in gasoline so it burns
''cleaner'' in combustion engines and reduces air pollution, but it has
increasingly been found in ground and surface water statewide. It is a
particular concern on Long Island because residents there depend on aquifers
for drinking water.

The additive must be in gasoline sold in high-smog parts of the state, which
encompasses most of the downstate New York region.
The Oxygenated Fuels Association also argued that since the reported
problems with MTBE are from leaking gasoline storage tanks, the solution is
to better enforce tank regulations in New York and not to ban the substance
from gas.

A spokeswoman for the state Department of Environmental Conservation,
Jennifer Post, said department lawyers hadn't reviewed the suit as of
Wednesday.

''We are confident of the legislation, which is necessary to protect public
health and safeguard water resources, and we will continue to fight for
federal action to ban MTBE and identify an acceptable alternative,'' Post
said.

Discussions of banning MTBE in New York elsewhere have ''been driven more by
politics and emotion than by sound science and we are counting on the courts
to put the issue back in perspective,'' said Thomas Adams, executive
director of the Oxygenated Fuels Association.

David Liddle, a spokesman for the association, said the intent of the Clean
Air Act was to allow a range of oxygenates - enabling cleaner-burning gas -
to be used and for the ''marketplace to decide'' which was superior.
If MTBE is banned, Liddle said, that would mean ethanol would be the only
real option left. He argued that ethanol is both more expensive than MTBE
and gas does not burn as cleanly using it.

''New York has unilaterally skewed the playing field and the result is
higher prices and dirtier air,'' he argued.

State environmental officials have said they are aware of about 1,700 MTBE
spills around New York state, although not all the spills have contaminated
water supplies.

MTBE was introduced starting in the late 1970s when the use of leaded
gasoline was banned, again because of health-related concerns.

In March, the Clinton administration moved to ban MTBE. That prohibition,
expected to take up to three years to implement, was a ''backstop measure''
in case Congress can't agree on a way to phase out MTBE, said Carol Browner,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.

MTBE is believed by some scientists to be a cancer-causing agent in animals,
but its effect on humans is being debated. A University of California study
last year concluded that more research is needed on its health effects, but
it added that MTBE has the ''potential to cause cancer in humans.'' Some
researchers have suggested that the inhalation or intake of MTBE can also
trigger headaches, asthma or neurological damage

Phil:

As you requested on last week's conference call, attached is a draft position 
on pipeline safety legislation.  The draft includes background and positions 
on both re-authorization legislation (on which there has been a great deal of 
activity lately) and appropriations legislation.

Once you and the Task Force have had the opportunity to review this material, 
it can be used to brief Stan Horton and Bob Hill in advance of the INGAA 
Board meeting this coming Thursday in Calgary.

Steve, as Dana indicated in his response to your message, Louis Dreyfus is 
maintaining that their transactions with Todoroff are totally legitimate and 
binding upon EOTT.  Vinson & Elkins is of the opinion that before we assert 
an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract, we 
need to hear the tapes of Todoroff's conversations with Louis Dreyfus.  The 
"paper" that we have (including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract 
administrator) certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that 
something was not quite right about the December 1999 transaction with 
Todoroff, but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the 
validity/enforceability of that contract.  We need more.  John DeGeeter of 
Vinson & Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus'  general counsel.  Louis 
Dreyfus' general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing 
EOTT with the tapes, he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is 
requesting the tapes.  Louis Dreyfus' general counsel has also indicated that 
he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations.

Although a final decision has not been made, here's where I think we are 
headed with Louis Dreyfus.  We will send their general counsel a letter next 
week indicating the irregularities with this contract (e.g. the prices quoted 
in the contract were far below market, and the contract administrator had 
questions about Todoroff's authorization and the "legality" of the deal).  
This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with 
their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can 
immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus' 
employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  My 
guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus'  
lawyers to listen to the tapes.  If the tapes do contain incriminating 
conversations, we might see a softening of their negotiating position.  If 
the tapes do not contain anything incriminating, it would seem to be in Louis 
Dreyfus' best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position 
that there was nothing irregular about the transaction.

Thanks for the update, Walt.  One option we were considering was a "share the 
pain" settlement with Dreyfus, whereby they would let us buy out of the 
remaining position at a steep discount (to acknowledge their contributory 
negligence in this matter).  Has there been any additional headway in this 
area?  I'm on vacation and haven't heard anything on this.  Weren't we going 
to send a V&E litigator to visit Dreyfus' general counsel? If we commence 
legal proceedings against Dreyfus, things will become costly and contentious 
between us. Information will come slowly and grudgingly.  We have copies of 
some of their internal notes which indicate that they knew---or should have 
known---that something wasn't quite right with Todoroff's situation.  Before 
we start filing discovery motions, we should exhaust the possibility of 
meeting with their general counsel to see if a quick "business" settlement 
can be obtained.  Please advise. Thanks.  SWD

Subject: Todoroff Prosecution--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT 
PRIVILEGE

Earlier this week, I spoke with Bill Moore (the chief prosecutor in the 
Harris County District Attorney's Special Crimes Unit) regarding the 
above-referenced matter.  Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative 
materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is 
commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the 
desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr. 
Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send 
a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he 
assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon 
some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that 
he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call 
Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this 
matter.

We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of 
Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are 
describing as "The Second Transaction."  If Louis Dreyfus does not 
voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that 
tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or 
seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some 
notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it 
appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss 
with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with 
Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a 
conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.

If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its 
conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how 
aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

With more than four dozen audience members watching, one of the parents, =

last June 10  when the explosion occurred in the pipeline of Olympic Pipe=

The agency has also drawn attention for sharply limiting the role states ca=

play in policing interstate pipelines -- a trend that delights oil and gas =

interests but worries some local governments. =20

Felder said his agency has allowed Olympic Pipe Line to continue operating =

because the company has performed "appropriate testing" of its lines. But h=

acknowledged the agency wouldn't know the cause of the Bellingham accident=

board's  investigation has stalled in recent months because some Olympic=20

"We'd also like to know more about how (the Bellingham) accident occurred. =

pipeline office's associate administrator. But, he said, "the less=20

Felder's comments drew an angry response from Frank King, who waved a =20
newspaper clipping about a day-care center in his state that was shut down =

immediately when a child in its custody died of undetermined causes. =20

"I find it outrageous," King said. "This is the only time I've ever seen =
=20
where one person is allowed to continue operating after murdering three =20
children." =20

Felder said he is encouraging states to focus on intrastate lines, such as =
=20
natural gas lines that heat homes. The vast majority of pipeline accidents=

--  about 80 percent -- involve such intrastate systems, according to=20

Stan,

Per your interest in putting some money to work, we will not be raising a
new fund until next fall at the earliest but I wanted to let you know about
another situation that might be of interest to you.  A good friend and
former client at Compaq, Bob Stearns, is putting together a fund to invest
in early stage technology deals.  Bob was SVP of technology and business
development at Compaq for several years but left when the crazies took over
(all of whom got fired, I might add).  Since I value my friendships too
much, I don't generally recommend people unless I really believe in who they
are and what they are doing.  Bob is top notch, which is why I would feel
comfortable recommending him to you and would be very pleased to introduce
you to Bob because you are top notch as well.  I thought Bob had closed his
fund already but he said he was going to have a second closing in about 30
days so there is still time to get in if you are interested.  The typical
investment is in the $500k to $1m range although I know of one person who
got in for $250k. ( I introduced him to Frevert and Rice and they have both
invested.)  Bob is still in Houston and offices over in the Galleria area.

If you would like to talk to Bob, let me know when and where you can be
reached and I will forward your information to him.

Dave

BNA Environment Reporter

Oil, Ethanol Industries Far From Deal
On Pending Senate Bill to Limit MTBE


Oil and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of 
the fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), making it uncertain 
whether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to 
craft an acceptable national
solution to the problem of MTBE in water, lobbyists told BNA April 17-19.

Despite fundamental differences, however, all sources interviewed for this 
story--including two oil industry officials, three ethanol advocates, and 
several other sources active in the legislative process on this issue--said 
that it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying 
multiple interests could be developed.

"I don't think we're at an impasse," one oil industry official said, echoing 
comments by others in the debate. "I just think it's going to take time." 
Whether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this 
legislative session remains to be seen, this official and others said.

The committee chairman, Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), has made MTBE a priority, 
saying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed 
by the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality 
benefits associated with MTBE-mixed gasoline.

The chairman's view of the issue, however, is contrary to the view held by 
the Clinton administration, by ranking minority member Sen. Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.), and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the 
Senate. These forces hold that corn-derived ethanol and possibly other 
"renewable" fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing 
the threat of MTBE water contamination.

The oil industry and Smith disagree with that view.

Smith Rejects 'Renewables' Linkage

When the Clinton administration announced on March 20 its support for a 
national renewable fuels mandate, Smith said "the issue of renewable fuels 
has absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water." 
He repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April 10.

In addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates, several other interest groups 
maintain an active role in the ongoing debate, and Senate committee staff ar 
continuing behind-the-scenes meetings with all sides, sources said.

Generally, comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the 
additive without necessarily eliminating it entirely. A committee bill also 
is expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act 
mandate currently driving the use of
MTBE and ethanol, another fuel oxygenate. At the same time, such a bill is 
expected to include "no backsliding" language to ensure that air toxics 
reductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years 
are maintained even if states
waive out of the air act mandate.

Sources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief 
for MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs.

Heavy Reliance on MTBE

MTBE is a high-oxygen, high-octane gasoline additive that is one of the most 
heavily produced chemicals in the United States. With roughly 12 million 
gallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States, the 
chemical makes up more than 3 percent of gasoline by volume, according to the 
oil industry.

MTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all 
"reformulated gasoline" contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight. 
Reformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality. 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 80 percent of 
reformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen 
requirement.

However, MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public 
water supplies, rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable. The 
health effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known, but the chemical 
does taste and smell bad, according to a February report by the Congressional 
Research Service.

RFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in 
their reformulated gasoline. Among other concerns in the legislative debate, 
the ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the 2 
percent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns, one 
industry representative said.

There were 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in 1999, 
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. USDA chief economist Keith 
Collins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April 11 that there are 
55 ethanol plants in operation in
"nearly 20 states."

Bill Would Ease 2 Percent Oxygen Rule

To address water quality concerns, Smith has signed on to legislation (S. 
1886) that would allow states to lift the 2 percent mandate driving MTBE use.

Introduced by Inhofe and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), S. 1886 would not 
ban or phase down MTBE outright. However, this is expected to change when and 
if the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive 
legislation, oil, ethanol, and other sources said.

"I think there's a growing set of opinion ... that MTBE either needs to be 
phased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some 
years," an oil industry source said.

Chemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul 
of underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination.

According to one source familiar with the issue, Senate committee staff 
members are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns 
of MTBE interests. Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup 
costs is under consideration, as is the idea that MTBE makers should get 
expedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical 
products.

In addition, the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of 
underground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation, this 
source said.

Daschle, Harkin Drafts

At least 14 bills have been introduced in the 106th Congress to address the 
problem of MTBE in water, according to the Congressional Research Service 
report. The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act 
requirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE.

Some of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agency's 
underground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main 
cause of water contamination. This approach is supported by certain MTBE 
makers, who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and 
not by the high-quality fuel additive.

Additional draft bills are pending introduction, including comprehensive 
legislation by Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate minority leader, that 
would significantly curtail MTBE use by 2004 while letting states take action 
before then.

Daschle's bill--said by Baucus's staff to be supported by the ranking EPW 
committee member--also would bolster ethanol production through a national 
renewable fuels mandate, expanding national average ethanol use to 2 percent 
or more over the next 10 years.

In addition, the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act 
to get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs.

Ethanol supporter Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) also is drafting MTBE legislation 
that he hopes to introduce soon after the Senate's Easter recess, a 
spokeswoman said. Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee and supports a renewable fuels standard. "If crafted in the right 
way,'' Harkin has said, such a standard "could result in far more ethanol use 
than current law."

Iowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity, 
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nebraska ranks third and 
Minnesota ranks fourth.

RFG Market

Despite calls for eliminating the 2 percent oxygenate requirement in the 
reformulated gasoline program, ethanol interests said they still support 
maintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban.

Such a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void, doubling 
ethanol use over three to five years, sources said. If Congress were to 
eliminate the 2 percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels 
requirement, ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current 
levels. However, it would do so over a longer period of about 10 years, one 
ethanol source said.

Oil industry officials, as well as Northeast states and some environmental 
advocates, oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a "de facto 
ethanol mandate." The oil industry also continues to oppose a national 
renewable fuels standard, officials said.

A representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April 11 that Smith 
appeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests, considering a 
national average "alternative fuel" requirement that would benefit ethanol as 
well as natural gas, electricity, and other transportation fuels.

The Northeast representative, Jason Grumet of Northeast States for 
Coordinated Air Use Management, supports the national average, alternative 
fuel approach, since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without 
requiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwest-derived ethanol.

However, oil company interests reaffirmed April 17 their long-held opposition 
to any new fuel mandates, saying concerns over MTBE in water should be 
addressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting 
any new mandates.

Oil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural 
states are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections, a 
second oil industry official said. It is not simply that the industry opposes 
new mandates--though that is
the case--but also that an ethanol-mandate "bidding war" might erupt in a 
year when  Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes, the 
official said.

Ethanol Supporters Want Expansion

Meanwhile, ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion 
of their product in the RFG market, and do not necessarily see a national 
renewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise.

The Clinton administration's renewable standard would require ethanol use 
initially at current levels of about 1.2 percent of gasoline. The mandate 
would then expand over 10 years, administration officials have said.

Ethanol is more volatile than MTBE, making it more difficult for oil refiners 
to produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for 
volatile organic compounds. This is one reason the "de facto mandate" is 
opposed by Northeast states and environmental interests. Some of the 
renewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to 
meet requirements over an annual average, enabling them to avoid or reduce 
their ethanol use in summer.

No Markup Scheduled

Smith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil, ethanol, environmental, 
MTBE, and state interests continue. A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE 
legislation "is something we're trying to get done quickly," but that a bill 
markup has not been scheduled.

Discussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE 
legislation are important to the legislative process, sources said, because a 
bill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from 
Democrats and Republicans on the committee, as well as from members of the 
Senate Agricultural Committee.

"I just can't see this getting duked out on the floor," said one ethanol 
lobbyist. "I think that we, the MTBE folks, the oil company folks, and the 
environmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on 
the floor."

According to one source, a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE 
use down to pre-1990 levels over about four years. Before the 1990 air act 
amendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline, MTBE was used mainly 
to enhance octane.

It is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both 
Democrats and Republicans, ethanol and oil interests, as well as to Northeast 
states, the Midwest, and California.

"Things change day to day," an oil industry official said. "I think the issue 
could be resolved without the ethanol piece, but the ethanol piece is just so 
difficult," he added.

"I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere 
with solid footing," an ethanol industry source said.

Dear Officers,

    We have been invited to participate as a profiled organization in the
upcoming "Energy Capital Houston" publication, published by Marcoa
Publishing, and sponsored by the Greater Houston Partnership and the City of
Houston. JoAnn and I met with their representative yesterday.  The
publication is annual, of very high quality and this is the inaugural issue.
It will be very widely distributed.  The publication will include a listing
of energy companies and related services, profiles from selected
organization, editorials and advertisements.  It is likely that some of your
companies have also been approached to be profiled (Enron, Reliant, Columbia
Gas, Price Waterhouse, etc.). It will be distributed to energy related
companies, trade shows, public utilities offices, and government agencies to
note a few.  The cost to be profiled is relatively small considering the
benefit we would realize -- and it could be accommodated through our
advertising revenues.

    Having said all of that -- I consider it an honor that GISB was invited
to participate -- but the timing is not good.  This publication would be
distributed throughout 2001 (it is to be completed at the end of September
and distribution to begin in December 2000) -- and GISB is not sure who or
what it will be in that time frame.  As such, I recommend we decline the
honor but ask them to consider us next year for the second issue.  Let me
know if you have thoughts to the contrary.

Best Regards,  Rae

I just wanted to recap our 2000 Earnings Target, based upon our discussions 
on Wednesday.

 1999 Consolidated Net Income   $49.6 Million
 
 2000 Target Consolidated Net Income  $96.6 Million
  (Included original "stretch" of $2.9M)

 2000 Base Operating Income Target  $147.4 Million

 2000 Current Estimate Base Operating Income $154.8 Million

Through June of 2000, in our Base Operating Income we were able to cover our 
original stretch of $2.9Million, 
as well as a Sale of Assets shortfall of $2.6 Million, resulting in our 
exceeding our Base Operating Income Target 
by a net amount of $1.9 Million.

We will now put into place a plan to cover the incremental stretch of at 
least $2.9 Million for 2000.  Our revised 2000 Consolidated Net Income Target 
is now $89.4 Million.  We will be meeting in the next few days to develop and 
implement our strategy to attain this target.  I will advise you of the 
possibilities which we will be pursuing to reach our 
target.

You should also recall that we are continuing to pursue reimbursement for our 
costs related to the lowering of the Black
Marlin pipeline across the Houston Ship Channel.  The Purchase and Sale 
Agreement for Black Marlin was
negotiated such that all dollars collected for that work will come back to 
Enron as income.

In the final analysis, I am confident that we will meet, or exceed, the 
target before us.  If you have any questions, or wish to discuss any of this, 
please call me.

We are now reviewing Information Memoranda on some Reliant Energy assets and 
must respond with a non-binding indication of interest by 5:00 PM, March 15.  
If we are selected to go on to the next phase of the process, we will be 
scheduled for a 2 day data room visit.  These sessions will begin on or about 
March 20.  It is a fairly fast track deal.  REI wants binding offers by April 
20, with final execution of a definitive agreement in late April/early May.

The assets are being offered either as a total package, or in any subset(s), 
broken down as follows:
 Reliant Energy Gas Transmission and Mississippi River Transmission  (to be 
viewed together as a single asset)
 Reliant Energy Field Services (gathering and processing)
 Reliant Energy Arkla (LDC)
 Reliant Energy Minnegasco (LDC)

We will need to find a solution to the PUHCA problem if we seriously want to 
buy either the Minnegasco or Arkla LDC assets (this could be very 
difficult).  The transmission and the field service assets would be "easier" 
to own from that standpoint.  In any event, we may want to go to all the data 
rooms just to learn about these assets.

Bottom line, if our preliminary bids are good enough to get into the data 
room phase of this deal, we will need a lot of help from the operations 
side.  These assets start with field gathering & processing, and end with 
retail gas deliveries to the homeowner ... truly a "stem to stern" asset 
package.  I'll keep you up to date on our progress, but we should be thinking 
about the team we'd put in the data room, and on site visits, etc. if given 
the opportunity.

Subject: EPA advance notice to regulate MTBE under TSCA

The EPA today issued its "Advance Notice of Intent to Initiate Rulemaking 
Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to Eliminate or Limit the Use 
of MTBE as a Fuel Additive in Gasoline."   As brief background, TSCA allows 
EPA to issue rules regulating chemical substances where there is an 
"unreasonable risk to health or the environment."  Such rules could lead to 
various levels of regulation of the manufacture, processing, or distribution 
of MTBE, including a complete ban or substantial limitations on use.

The purpose of such this notice is to request comments as to whether EPA 
should go forward with a proposed rule.  Comments are due by May 8, 2000.  If 
EPA decides to move forward with a proposed rule, our sources indicate this 
would not likely occur for at least 6 months, as EPA first has to deal with 
comments on the current "advance notice" and make some decisions before 
proceeding.

OFA will be submitting comments on behalf of MTBE producers, and will be 
working to get other groups like the Chemical Manufacturers Association and 
American Methanol Institute to comment as well.  They have also suggested 
that individual companies provide comments to EPA as well.

I have asked the regulatory and technical analysis staff in Enron 
Environment, Health and Safety to review the EPA document and provide 
recommendations as to the viability of EPA's efforts to regulate MTBE under 
TSCA, the possible impacts on Enron's MTBE operations if TSCA regulation were 
to be finalized, and the potential areas where Enron might best comment.

I would appreciate your initial comments on whether it is appropriate or 
advisable for Enron to provide comments for the EPA record in this "advance 
notice" stage.   While our technical staff should be able to provide some 
recommendations based on their review, the broader, political issue is 
whether Enron should engage in the TSCA debate at all, given our pursuit of 
more of an "exit strategy" for our MTBE asset (stranded costs, liability 
protection). 

Please let me know your views as soon as possible.  I will forward analysis 
from our technical team as soon as it is available.

Thank you.

Transwestern had 11 releases during the period 11/15-12/15/00.  None were 
above max. rate.  All were at max. rate.

El Paso had several dozen releases during this period in the CA zone.  All 
but 5 are listed as straight max rate deals.  Five have a fixed rate which 
are also within +/- 1 cent of the max rate (assumably for surcharge related 
reasons).

Subject: Additional Arguments for Enron's Gas Cap Response



Premise: FERC should investigate the utility decisionmaking that led the 
Califonia market to the point of excess gas demand, rather than rush to 
impose gas price caps.

Utilities had ample opportunity to fill up storage last summer, but most 
likely choose not to for price reasons.

Transwestern had at least a 100 M/D of available capacity to Califonia and to 
the SoCal Needles delivery point through July 2000.  
 
 Avg. Scheduled (compared to 1.1 Bcf/D capacity): April  780 
        May  820
        Jun-Jul  980
        Aug  1050
        Oct-Dec 1080 (essentially full)

During the period April-Jul, TW was able to deliver up to the full 750 M/D at 
Needles, but on many days SoCal gas instituted "windowing," lowering the 
ability to take at Needles to 680-720 M/D.  SoCal's argument was that they 
didn't believe that there was sufficient demand to run at the 750 M/D level 
(even when TW had nominations of 750 M/D).

El Paso was also not full to Califonia until the last month.   At all times 
El Paso  had available capacity at PG&E delivery points.  During the pipeline 
outage El Paso was limited in their ability to fully deliver to the North 
SoCal delivery point.  However, they were not full for deliveries to SoCal at 
the south system delivery point.


2.    Utilities have opposed pipeline expansions to California

Sempra protested Transwestern's 140 M/D Gallup expansion, arguing that there 
is no need for new capacity (CP99-522).

Sempra has also protested Questar's application to convert an oil line to new 
gas pipeline service to California (S. Trails Expansion).

Dear Board Task Force --
Attached is an agenda for the upcoming meeting on April 17.  It is patterned
from the agenda used in the Committee of the Whole meetings held in
Washington in 1993/94 where GISB scope was discussed.  Please let me know if
you have any changes.  Both Bob Gee and Jerry Langdon have agreed to open the
meeting.  Beginning at 1 PM and ending at 6 PM should allow many to get in
and out of Washington on the same day.    Best Regards, Rae

Stan -

Please see the attached email which summarizes our last strawman conference
call.  I wanted to point out where each of the participants was coming from
by separate email.  Hugh Roberts and Alan Knoop, who were attending a
producer meeting were adamantly opposed to the models offered by both Greg
Lander and Jim Templeton.  They did not want any structure which would
diminish their rights and took the position that both were non-starters.
The same was also true of Mike Novak who spoke for the LDC's.  Hugh offered
a third model which kept both gas and electric essentially separate with
what he termed a "Energy Standards Advisory Communication Liaison" as the
interface between GISB and EISB (Electric Industry Standards Board).  My
concern was this did not go far enough to assure that cross industry issues
would be addressed.  To bridge the gap, we elevated the bridge to an
"Executive Committee" level with representation from both gas and electric
with a charter to review only those issues which cut across both industries.
Personally, I view this as an evolutionary process to get all segments
comfortable with the mechanics of dealing with cross industry issues.  If we
push for a combined Board, the votes from the Producers and LDC's are not
there.  Maybe the "EC level" is a good start.  We have another conference
call this Thursday.  I would appreciate your thoughts/reaction to this
hybrid strawman recognizing that we have not discussed any details.  Pending
the outcome of this weeks call with Jim, Greg and Rae hopefully in
attendance I will let you know where things stand.  If we are still on this
track after the call, I would like to have a follow up conference call with
the Pipeline segment to get everyone up to speed.

>
> * The model offered by Hugh Roberts preserved the respective rights of
> each segment represented in the gas industry but did not go far enough to
> assure that issues which impacted by gas and electric would be properly

>
> Therefore, the participants crafted a hybrid option which can best be

Dear GISB Members and Interested Industry Participants,

    At the Executive Committee meeting in February, the Executive Committee
created a new subcommittee, the Expedited Data Development (EDD)
Subcommittee.  The EDD Subcommittee has been charged with the development of
the information requirements standards for (1) imbalance netting and trading
and (2) title transfer tracking.   The Executive Committee placed a higher
priority on the imbalance netting and trading topic.

    The subcommittee's first meeting is scheduled on March 13 and 14 in
Houston, hosted at the Dynegy offices, to be held from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
 Please join me in thanking Ms. Hess of Enron Gas Pipeline Group and Ms.
Munson of Altra Energy Technologies for volunteering their time to lead this
effort.

    An agenda and work papers will be posted on the GISB Home Page shortly
for this first meeting.  The first meeting will address imbalance netting and
trading ONLY.

    If you or other representatives of your company would like your email
address to be maintained on an email distribution list for this subcommittee,
please forward your name, email address, phone and fax to the GISB office.
GISB follows a privacy policy and will not provide your email address to
other groups for their use.

    We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

Best Regards,
Rae McQuade

Lynn: 

I think there is wisdom in seeking to separate money from terms at this 
point. If TW and TNN reach an agreement on money. Then, in some sense, TNN 
will be counting on this money and there should be some pressure to reach a 
final agreement so that the money can be paid. This may cause some 
flexibility on terms. If we are trying to negotiate both money and terms at 
the same time, the sovereignty zealots can argue, "they (TW) haven't even 
agreed to a "fair" consideration, and now they want to take our sovereignty." 

It has been said that "when money goes out the door, love goes out the 
window." Perhaps the converse is true. 

A final thought is that I am aware of the Standing Rock scenario where an 
agreement on consideration was reached first and then the deal fell apart on 
the question of terms. While my knowledge of all the details is not complete, 
it is my understanding that in that case, (unlike the present situation), it 
was not made crystal clear to TNN that the Standing Rock terms still needed 
negotiation. Moreover, I am not sure that in Standing Rock you had the 
participation of a TNN Task Force that included Navajo Nation Council 
Committee Chairs (who should furnish the impetus for completing a deal and 
getting the money once consideration is agreed on.)

Attached is the final program (Word format) with times, places, speakers and
titles, and who is doing the introducing/moderating.  We have, in the last 48
hours, had to accommodate several speaker adjustments at their requests --
due to inability to attend (Raul Monteforte/Alejandro Brena, Bobby
Perez/Paula Miles) and travel schedule restrictions based on hearings on
pending legislation (Cathy Van Way).  All in all, this should be final -- and
JoAnn and I have the gray hairs to prove it!

Bios and script (including the changes above) should be provided shortly.  Rae

Jeff:  okay, DOE will do it but wants to make a bigger deal out of the 
announcement  than Monday at NARUC.  Translation, Secretary Richardson is a 
powerful Secretary and he wants to make the announcement and take credit for 
this himself.  Congratulations!  We'll let you know when it happens.  Also, 
NRDC thinks this is a great idea and wants to serve with Ashook Gupta as 
their representative.  Have a great week-end!        cynthia

Mr. Horton:

Does "Standing Rock right-of-way" mean an additional payment for Standing Rock
based on the amount agreed on for Standing Rock in 1998? (If so, the counter
seems appropriate.)

Mr. Zaman called Larry yesterday to discuss the most recent offer.  

Larry had the opportunity to discuss with Mr. Zaman the sense of urgency on 
TW's part and the desire to meet with the decision making body - the NNERTF.  
Apparently Mr. Zaman was of the impression that TW would not be pressed to 
take legal action until the ROW expired.

Mr. Zaman was encouraged by the TW approach of an incentive but offered no 
insights on the acceptability of the offer.  He did promised to review it 
with the task force in the near future and indicated that Johnny could expect 
a response in the near future regarding the letter and the request for a 
meeting.

On May 24th McGee spoke to Zaman concerning the Task Force's response to 
Transwestern's March 15th offer.  Zaman relayed that the Task Force met last 
week (there was not a quorum) and he discussed Transwestern's request for a 
timely response. The Task Force is still waiting for a report from a third 
party consultant.  Without directly saying so, Zaman indicated that this 
consultant's report is more in the nature of the future of natural gas 
markets generally than an analysis of Transwestern'saoffer.  McGee was able 
to obtain from Zaman some information concerning Zaman's recommendation to 
the Task Force.  Zaman is recommending both a larger up front payment and a 
higher rate per mmbtu on transportation volumes.  Zaman would not divulge the 
magnitude of either component.

The Task Force is currently meeting once a month.  Zaman has recommended that 
the Task Force provide Transwestern a written response with enough time to 
digest the counter offer prior to a meeting with the full Task Force.  This 
approach fits well with Transwestern's requirements regardless of whether 
Transwestern is forced to pursue litigation or continues to proceed solely 
with negotiation.  Zaman promised to contact Trujillo and encourage a 
response in the near future.  

McGee and Zaman discussed a possible meeting with the Task Force in June but 
this will depend on when the Task Force decides to issue a response and 
scheduling concerns.

I wanted to report that since meeting with the Crossroads folks in May they 
have owed us information which would allow us to place a new valuation on the 
Crossroads acquisition.  They have called in twice to ask for more time to 
provide the information. Since we have been focusing our attention on Wyoming 
and Alberta deals we did not object to their delay.

This week Dan Gavito called in and left the message that in a few days we 
might see an announcement that the utility, NIPSCO and the new pipeline 
Vector have concluded a deal where NIPSCO will take short haul capacity on 
Vector ( to Indiana) and that Vector will interconnect with Crossroads.  Dan 
called to emphasize that this deal with Vector would have NO impact on 
Crossroads continuing conversations with NBP to buy a share in Crossroads.

Based upon discussions with L. Dietz and S. Misner ( Kansas ) who, are 
working with C. Presgrove (Oklahoma ) to control the vols. and BS&W  received 
unmetered via truck into the Kansas system. Last winter the water content of 
such crude transported via pipe to our Ok. system was unacceptable ( 1+% ) 
therefore, the pipeline from Ok. to Ka. has been targeted for measurement 
improvement. L. Dietz is working with C. Presgrove to identify surplus 
equipment in an effort to reduce the cost of this project. The locations, 
vols. and original cost estimate are as follows.

Based upon the above, I recommend approval of this proposed project pending a 
revised cost estimate. The remaining un- metered  truck injection stations 
located in Kansas will be a 2001 project.

Dave,

I had a short conversation with Scott this morning and explained the job, why 
we have vacancies, etc.  He is going to evaluate the job description and see 
if there would be any ties in this job to his future career goals.  In other 
words, he doesn't see himself taking a long-term departure from Investor 
Relations, but possibly there are some skills he would gain in this job that 
would make him even more valuable in a future IR role.  For example, when he 
was with El Paso, IR and PR were combined.

He said that he would follow up with me this afternoon or Monday and let me 
know if he has interest in discussing further.

In Project 20/20, Northern Border Partners, LP (NBP),  proposes the addition 
of 20 employees now located in Denver and working for Enron North America.   
These 20 employees have developed four packages of gathering assets in the 
Powder and Wind River Basins in the state of Wyoming. In 3 out of 4 of the 
packages it is a fractional ownership situation where NBP will not control 
the gathering company.   NBP wishes to acquire these asset packages and the 
20 people who presently manage them.  The 20 individuals perform the 
following functions  (1)Finance and Structuring (2)Commercial Development and 
Asset Management (3) Engineering and Operations (4) Deal Origination.

The natural gas gathered by the subject gathering assets finds its way to 
market using the following interstate pipelines, Trailblazer, CIG, Kern 
River, and to a limited extent, Williston Basin, Kinder Morgan and MIGC.   In 
numerous situations the gas will be purchased at the wellhead by ENA and 
transported through gathering systems to be owned in whole or in part by 
NBP.    Those individuals who approve the purchase of the wellhead gas (and 
determine the pricing) are not included  in the 20 employees who would come 
to work for NBP.   ENA and NBP do contemplate future joint venture projects 
where ENA would buy and sell gas and NBP would build gathering systems. 

It is proposed that the 20 employees, located in Denver and led by an officer 
located there will be employees of a division of Northern Plains Natural Gas 
Company  (a wholly owned sub of Enron and operator of Northern Border 
Pipeline Company).  It is not intended that the 20 employees ever have duties 
with respect to the management or operation of NBPL.  It is proposed that the 
Denver officer would report to the President of Northern Plains and the 
Chairman of NBP (Currently Larry Deroin). 

THE QUESTION:  Do the FERC's standards of conduct regarding marketing 
affiliates impose restrictions on the deal as described or the individuals 
proposing to come to work at NPNG on behalf of NBP.  If so, please describe 
the restrictions and suggest improvements in the proposed structure.  ( 
Assume as a given that the 20 employees want to remain within the Enron 
family of companies.)

We hope to get the documents for this deal signed up within the next several 
days.  Once these documents are executed, our biggest challenge will be to 
accomplish all of the "physical" things 
(permitting/approvals/construction,etc.) that will be necessary for us to 
perform on this deal.  While we have every expectation that we will be able 
to accomplish these things, our Bakersfield gas plant is in a very sensitive 
environmental location, and we must acknowledge that there is always the 
chance that we will not be able to get all required approvals, etc. from all 
applicable authorities.  We have built strong "outs" into our agreements with 
Oxy to protect us against this possibility (we won't be liable to them if we 
can't perform because we can't get the needed permits/approvals), but we all 
need to recognize that there is at least some degree of economic loss (in the 
form of sunk costs) that we will suffer if this deal does not go through.

I believe that Enron's financial group has okayed this deal (Joe, please 
confirm), and that we have spent about $1.5 million on this project to date.  
Also, it is my understanding that we will be spending about $250.000 on this 
deal per week as we move forward.  My understanding is that approximately 
half of what we have already spent is on supplies/pipe/materials that would 
be sellable/reusable if this deal does not ultimately make it for the reasons 
stated above. I do not know the percentage of future expenses that would be 
"salvageable."

In any case, this deal is a great opportunity for our West Coast segment, and 
our mindset is that we WILL be successful in completing all 
construction/permitting needed to perform with Oxy.  We want to begin 
performing with Oxy as soon as possible, and to do this, we are 
building/spending/constructing while, at the same time, nailing down all 
needed approvals. Thanks.  SWD

Stan, Dana has suggested and I agree that we would like you to consider 
shifting EOTT Houston employees
from the EOTT benefit plan to Enron's benefit plan.  Availablity of Enron 
options to retain our key employees is a key issue.
We'd like to discuss this with you at your convenience.

Stan, please see the attached from Kerry.  We have been close to shut down 
economics but believe it still makes sense to run.  Please let me know if you 
want to disscuss this further.

Subject: February 2000 EMC Financial Results

For the month of February, the Enron Methanol Company Income Statement 
reflects a negative gross margin.  As you pointed out, this raises a question 
as to whether we should have been running the plant during the month. 
Hopefully, this brief explanation will clarify the reasons we continued to 
run.

As stated above, the gross margin was slightly negative; however, this 
includes the cost of oxygen. Most of the oxygen expense (approx. $300,000) is 
a fixed cost because of our take or pay agreement with Praxair.  As a result, 
when we evaluate whether or not to run, we look only at variable costs (which 
do not include $300,000 of oxygen). If we ignore this take or pay oxygen 
cost, then the gross margin is approx. $200,000 positive. This is roughly 
equal to our variable O&M costs which means that were at "break even" for 
variable margin and expenses. Given the high possibility of freezing 
temperatures in February and an analysis that indicated that we could break 
even for all variable costs, the decision was made to run the plant to 
protect against freeze damage.

FYI -- this is the latest initiative by the Administration to address MTBE 
concerns in this election year.   Directing resources toward cleanup and 
leaking tanks are measures that the MTBE industry has been advocating with 
the Administration and Congress.  Particularly given the current debate over 
high gasoline prices and RFG's possible role, it has been evident over the 
past few weeks that the White House and Congress have become less interested 
in tinkering with the RFG program and more interested in achievable, 
near-term efforts such as this.

EPA TAKES ACTION TO ADDRESS MTBE CONTAMINATION
FOR RELEASE:  THURSDAY, JULY 6, 2000

EPA TAKES ACTION TO ADDRESS MTBE CONTAMINATION

EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner today announced that the Clinton-
Gore Administration will fund two $1 million pilot projects, one each
in New York and California, to assist with the cleanup of the gasoline
additive MTBE in contaminated community water supplies.  Areas of Long
Island, N.Y., and Santa Monica, Calif., are among those communities
most affected by  MTBE contamination.
     "To protect public health and the environment, the Clinton-Gore
Administration has called on Congress to eliminate MTBE from gasoline,
and we've begun regulatory action aimed at phasing it out," said
Browner.  "However, in the meantime, action must be taken to help
communities already affected by MTBE leaks.  Today, we are providing
additional funding to help New York and California remove MTBE
contamination in affected communities and prevent future problems from
leaking tanks."

     New York is being awarded $1 million to accelerate cleanup at 50
MTBE contaminated sites on Long Island.  The funds for Santa Monica,
Calif. will be used to help the state and the city with the cleanup of
MTBE contaminated groundwater.

     MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is an additive in gasoline
used by many refiners to meet a provision of the Clean Air Act that
calls for the use of oxygenates in fuels.  In 1999, the Clinton-Gore
Administration convened a Blue-Ribbon Panel to investigate if MTBE
posed special risks to water supplies.  In the Fall of 1999, the Panel
presented scientific proof confirming that MTBE threatens water
supplies.  The Administration subsequently called on Congress to phase
down or eliminate MTBE.  The Administration also has begun regulatory
action to control MTBE under the Toxics Substances Control Act.

Dear Jim, Stan, Hugh & Bill,

Attached please find correspondence from Mary Jane McCartney regarding
ConEd's perspective on expanding GISB's standards setting activities.  I
spoke to her this morning, and she has shared this correspondence with the
LDC Board members and felt that it was appropriate to share it with you also.
 She noted that she did not intend it as comments for posting on our web

SENT ON BEHALF OF MIKE BURKE

With your input, I developed the following documents (attached below) about 
six months ago.

EOTT Guiding Documents


EOTT Energy Strategies


EOTT Core Competencies & Company Strengths


With your continued help, what we now must do is to sharpen and focus our 
strategy and decide what we will select as the critical few core competencies 
of EOTT.  (Trying to be all these thing to everybody id tantamount to being 
nothing for anyone)  We must find the unique value that we alone can and will 
deliver to our chosen market.

As outlined in Michael Tracy's "The Discipline of Market Leaders," our task 
is to define and develop three essential concepts.
1.  The value proposition:  The implicit promise EOTT will make to customers 
to deliver a particular combination of values, price, quality, performance, 
solution, convenience, etc.

2.  The Value driven operations model:  The right combination of operating 
processes, management systems, business structure, and culture that gives 
EOTT the capacity to deliver on its value proposition.

3.  Value discipline:  EOTT must choose one of the three value disciplines 
below on which to stake our market reputation.

Operational Excellence:  (Middle of the market products/services at the best 
price with the least inconvenience) or 
Product/Service/Leadership (the very best performance in product/service) or 
Customer Intimacy (selectively chosen customers/best solution for unique 
customer/customer intimacy)

I will provide the first draft of a much more focused and disciplined 
strategy in the next few days.  Your input is always welcome.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 2000
NEW CLEAN-FUEL REQUIREMENT ADDRESSES 'MTBE' CONCERNS
Rule Adopted Today Applies to Eastern Third of State

A new rule adopted today by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) places limits on increases in the use of the gasoline
additive MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) while still retaining the air
quality benefits of cleaner burning fuels.

The requirement, which applies to gasoline sold in 95 counties comprising
the eastern third of the state, prohibits the increased use of MTBE to meet
a requirement that the gasoline evaporates less quickly than conventional
gasoline.

The new rule also requires all parties in the gasoline distribution chain to
maintain proper documentation of fuel transfers, and gasoline producers must
certify in annual reports that the use of MTBE in their gasoline has not
been increased to meet the low evaporative requirements.

The MTBE provisions in the new rule address concerns about how this
additive, which is highly water soluble, can adversely affect water quality
if spilled into a stream or groundwater.

While the TNRCC estimates that drinking water containing levels as high as
240 parts per billion (ppb) of MTBE over a lifetime would have no adverse

Attached below is the status of expenditures for ENTRIX tasks under all of 
the task orders through June 28, 2000.  We are working on a report that will 
forecast planned expenditures for the next two quarters.  We will update 
these lists monthly, and should have additional report formats available for 
your review within two weeks.

There seems to be a lot of interest in, and perhaps some concern about, the 
ENTRIX task orders.  This list shows all approved year 2000 task orders, the 
approved (ENTRIX) budget for each, and the amount spent through 6/28/00.  
None of this is secret stuff, and I will be happy to answer any questions 
that you have.  As mentioned above, we are working on other reports that will 
show all spending for all active environmental sites, along with forecasts 
for future spending.  We will need three or four reports to show this 
information, and I will modify the format to meet your needs.  

Information for all 2000 spending on all active sites is currently available 
to everyone on EMS Works, but you can't produce meaningful reports.  The EMS 
Works information is about 98% complete, as we have some issues of recoding 
of invoices and new invoices not yet entered- all in the Midland office.  
These should be resolved within the next two weeks.  Note that task order 37 
is being revised and has not been approved yet, so it doesn't make the list.

Call if you have questions.
Cutty

Dear Board Members,

    Attached please find a report that lists the expenses to date regarding
the GISB participation in response to the CUBR request and its impact on our
2000 Annual Plan.  Also attached are the participants in the industry and
association meetings, again for GISB participation in response to the CUBR
request.  This material should be considered in conjunction with the 6-8
Board meeting materials regarding development of a new standards organization
-- it can be used to determine what our organization has spent, how many
people have expressed an interest (either for or against) in the process, and
how our existing annual plan workload has been impacted.

    I want to thank Hugh Roberts, our treasurer, for asking for this
material.  It should provide further information for you to consider at our
upcoming Board meeting.

Best Regards,  Rae

Jon,

Following up your two questions this morning, we obtained the following info 
from pulling invoices and phone inquiries.

Temp & Contract - Systems Fees ($28) variance 

Variance attributable to RC 9701 - Systems Software which budgeted $6.7 and 
incurred $34.8 for consulting services and contract support. Discussed with 
Steve Findley. The invoices are summarized as follows:

McCorquadale Consulting - $8.2 for commercial maps and web support.
Indu Kilambi Consulting -      $5.1 for general systems support
Idea Integration -                     $8.6 for commercial maps and 
documentation preparation
Comsys Consulting -           $12.9 for FoxPro position reporting issues
                                                   $34.8


Major Expense Jobs - Crane System ($106) variance

Variance attributable to RC 7354 - TXNM Crane System which budgeted -0- and 
incurred $105.6. Discussed with Gary Wright and Fixed Assets accounting, 
waiting on answer from Bobby Garduno.

Review of invoices revealed that only $24 related to Crane Flood (Albritton 
Machine, Inc. for pump repair and reconditioning). Garduno to provide 
description of flood. Balance of $81.6 related to cleaning and work on Ozona 
Tank #1339. Apparently an AFE has been prepared for the Ozona Tank work, but 
the AFE has not been approved. If the AFE is approved, these costs will be 
capitalized.

=09=09 Subject: draft statement of the problems with S.2438



here is a first cut at our problem statement for the pipeline safety
reauthorization bill
let me know what you think

Pipeline safety act reauthorization =0F- issues after the Senate markup

On June 15 the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation
unanimously reported S.2438, Senator McCain=0F's bill to amend the Pipeline
Safety Act.  Much of this bill is acceptable and would represent a
reasonable and even welcome resolution of issues raised since the petroleum
products pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington in June 1999.
Unfortunately however, the treatments accorded five specific issues by the
bill are so objectionable that unless changes in these areas can be made,
passage of the bill must be opposed.  This said, there is good reason to
believe that an aggressive effort can be successful in correcting the
treatment of these issues by opposing passage of the bill until changes are
made.

The bill and committee report are expected to be filed in the Senate after
the July 4th recess.  At that time we need to have in place commitments fro=
m
several Senators to withhold consent for consideration of the bill until
specific changes are made.  If the negotiations that could be expected to
follow communication of these holds to Sen.Gorton, Sen. McCain and the
Majority Leaders yield an acceptable amended bill, we would push hard for
passage and enactment of that bill.

 The changes that must be made to the bill in order to support passage are:

Mandatory reassignment of personnel  -- under section 13(b) an operator mus=
t
reassign any employee whose performance of duties affecting safety is under
an accident investigation by DOT of the NTSB.  Failure to comply leads to
shutdown of the pipeline.  There is no discretion.  The scope of coverage i=
s
determined by investigators, and the length of reassignment is the length o=
f
the investigation.  This provision could force the reassignment after even =
a
small accident of a large number of pipeline employees, including
management, for an indefinite period of time, threatening the safe operatio=
n
of the line.

Counter:  Must be deleted or substantially modified.  Seek to narrow
application:  to serious accidents, specific employees, limited period of
reassignment; insert flexibility, authority to reinstate if conditions are
met, discretion in application based on due process, lack of probable
culpability considerations.

Regional Citizens=0F' Advisory Councils  --  Under Section 15 the Secretary=
 of
Transportation would appoint potentially fifty or more state based citizens=
=0F'
advisory councils that would advise the Secretary on a broad range of
pipeline safety issues, proposals for new pipeline facilities, pipeline
permitting and standards and other pipeline-related matters.  These advisor=
y
councils would be federally funded, of unlimited duration and would not be
subject to the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (e.g.
balance in composition, chair by a federal official, restrictions on
conflict of interest).  In effect these councils provide a
federally-sanctioned platform and financial vehicle to support opposition t=
o
pipelines on a local, state and also potentially on a national basis.

Counter  --  Must be deleted in the present form.  We would aggressively
seek to prevent enactment of the entire bill rather than accept a federal
program to subsidize a platform for opposition to pipelines and pipeline
projects.   As an alternative the charter of the existing federal advisory
committees (one for liquids and one for gas) should be expanded to encourag=
e
attention to local concerns.  Reiterate that federal advisory committees
must comply with FACA.  Reemphasize the industry=0F's commitment to public
right to know, but opposition to a proliferation of regulatory or
quasi-regulatory authorities to which pipelines must respond.

Review of  Operator Pipeline Integrity Programs  --  Section 5 of the bill
requires each pipeline operator to solicit and respond to the views of stat=
e
and local officials during development of pipeline integrity plans.  In
addition, States with interstate agent status may review these plans at any
time, and the Secretary must seriously consider the state=0F's recommendati=
ons.

Counter  --  Must be substantially modified.  As drafted this is an
essentially regulatory provision requiring negotiation between the operator
and an indefinite number of state or local groups. Right-to-know is
acceptable, multiple response to comments is not. Eliminate implication tha=
t
operators must respond to an unlimited number of reviews and recommendation=
s
on their pipeline integrity plans.  Convert requirement that operators
respond to all state and local concerns to a requirement that OPS respond t=
o
these concerns or that the state collect these concerns for forwarding to
OPS.  Operators should only be required to inform appropriate state and
local officials about the plan.  Channel any resulting state and local
concerns about the plans through the state to the Secretary of
Transportation rather than to the operators for response.

State authority for =0F"other activities=0F" =0F- Section 9 of the bill aut=
horizes a
state to participate in the oversight of interstate pipeline transportation
under an agreement with the Secretary.  However, the provision goes on to
require the agreement to include authority to =0F"participate in other
activities overseeing interstate pipeline transportation or to assume
additional inspection or investigatory duties=0F".  The additional authorit=
y
opens the door for delegation of unspecified =0F"other=0F" functions to the=
 State,
which further balkanizes the regulation of interstate facilities.

Counter  --  Drop the =0F"other activities=0F" language altogether or defin=
itively
clarify that the only activities are inspection activities within the
federal program undertaken at the direction of the Secretary.

Whistleblower Protection for Pipeline Employees --  Section.14 applies
=0F"whistleblower=0F" protection for pipeline employees identical to that e=
nacted
earlier this Congress for airline employees.  Affords an employee a right t=
o
challenge with the U.S. Department of Labor an unfavorable job action that
the employee feels is the result of advocacy of safety related improvements=
.

Counter  --  Drop the provision or seek to have a study carried out to
determine if the provision is required to maintain an adequate level of
safety in the pipeline industry.  Is an analogy between pipeline and airlin=
e
employees appropriate?  Modify to lessen the potentially disruptive impact
on the industry.

Additional concern (natural gas lines)  --  Section 5 of the bill requires
=0F"internal inspection or pressure testing, or another equally protective
method, where these techniques are not feasible=0F" to periodically test th=
e
pipeline.   Natural gas operators feel this language, written with liquid
operators in mind, does not adequately account for the differences between
the internal testing possibilities for lines carrying relatively
incompressible liquids as opposed to compressible gas.  This language may
force use of internal inspection in the relatively large portion of natural
gas lines that cannot accept internal inspection devices.

Counter =0F- the natural gas operators have proposed replacing this languag=
e
with a more flexible approach, requiring =0F"periodic assessment of the
pipeline=0F's integrity, through methods including internal inspection,
pressure testing, direct assessment of other effective methods=0F".

I checked with Rick Buy's group on where they were on The RAROC analysis of
your proposed broadband project. They aren't doing anything according to Rod
who checked for me. It seems to me that we need to do several things to either
kick this into gear or to put it on hold pending completion of a sale. 

1. We need to find out from Mark Metts if this deal adds any value to the
transactions being proposed. I will talk with Mitch and Mark about this issue.

2. We need to determine EBS interest in this business..ie are they a buyer or
seller of Portland metro dark fiber. If they want to be in this business
wouldn't it make to develop this project as EBS and not to include it in a
sale? 
3. A project of this size will take Jeff's approval. The projected Phase I
capital is above my threshold. 

I will talk with Kevin Hannon and Mitch and then get back with you. Sound like
a plan?

Almost one month ago, Special Agent Carl Wake of the FBI called me about the 
Steve Todoroff investigation.  He indicated that the FBI had recently learned 
of the article about EOTT's NGL theft that appeared in the business section 
of the Houston Chronicle.  Mr. Wake said it might be a matter the FBI would 
like to investigate.  I told Mr. Wake that EOTT was currently working with 
the Harris County District Attorney on the prosecution of this matter, and I 
thanked him for the FBI's interest.  He told me that the FBI might want to 
work with the Harris County District Attorney in investigating this matter, 
and he stated that there may be investigative information that the FBI can 
obtain more quickly than the Harris County District Attorney.  Mr. Wake 
requested a copy of the materials we had provided to the Harris County 
District Attorney.

In order to avoid damage to the good rapport we have established with 
Assistant District Attorney Bill Moore, I asked John DeGeeter to call Bill 
Moore and advise him of the contact that had been made by the FBI.  Bill 
Moore agreed to call Carl Wake and work with Mr. Wake on his request for the 
materials provided by EOTT.

Carl Wake called me again yesterday.  He has been working with Bill Moore.  
Mr. Wake stated it was too early to speculate as to what charges would be 
brought.  He did say that our materials clearly indicated federal wire fraud 
and possibly mail fraud.  He said that where there is wire fraud, there is 
usually money laundering. 

The purpose of Mr. Wake's call yesterday was to inquire about the status of 
some interview summaries that John DeGeeter and I have prepared and collected 
at the request of Bill Moore.  Mr. Wake requested that EOTT send a copy of 
the summaries to him when we sent the summaries to Bill Moore.  Those 
summaries were sent out today.

I gathered from my calls with Carl Wake that the FBI is very interested in 
taking an active part in this investigation.  In order to build on the 
relationship we have established with Bill Moore, we will continue to direct 
our inquires about the investigation to Mr. Moore until he tells us to do 
otherwise.

Stan,

Thanks.  I would be happy to provide individual comment on a revised strawman.

I think the key will be creating autonomous practice writing units under an 
umbrella board that has no power to itself write or modify practices.

So, for example, GISB would remain largely the way it is.  No one else would 
write or approve gas wholesale standards.  But a high level EISB board would 
concern itself with coordination, resources, and process.  That way we avoid 
the problem of wholesale players driving retail standards, gas driving 
electric, etc.  That was a clear message from the meeting we had.  I envision 
3 units, GISB, retail, and some electric wholesale.  Make sense?

You really need to invent a process that minimizes the number of players with 
control over someone elses assets, if the scope is wide.  If the scope is 
very narrow (like Rae's list) there can be lots of players.

I am looking to proceed with identifying the scope, governance & resource 
requirements for the retail component.  My goal is to turn the retail ubp 
over to a suitable organization after version 1 is complete.  If EISB wants 
to meet those requirements and be that organization, it can be.  I want to 
put retail to bed.

I'll  get back to you on the EEI board meeting.  At the moment, the heat is 
on reliability and FERC filings.

Thanks
  -Mike
>>> <Stanley.Horton@enron.com> 07/07/00 12:06PM >>>

Mike:

GISB has established a sub-committee to refine the strawman we sent to you
earlier.  Our aim is to have this ready by mid-August.

Our goal is then to take the strawman on the road to present to several
electric utility CEO's.  Hopefully, we can begin to gather some support for
the EISB approach.

We also plan to take the strawman to several of the ISO's, NERC, DOE, FERC,
etc.

A meeting with the EEI Board in September, per your suggestion, would fit
well into this plan.

Our goal is to determine whether there is industry support for the EISB
model by December.  I think this does that.

Any comments and/or suggestions you may have would be appreciated.

Stan

Subject:  Re:


Stan,

I'm thinking through that right now.  Frankly, the problem I see is in
being able to put an agenda together that would be attractive enough for
our CEO task force members.  I haven't figured out how to make a face to
face meeting before the September board meeting worthwhile, although a
conference call might work.  We probably could develop a formal task force
response to the strawman, but in some ways I think the first meeting notes,
draft principles and the concerns paper covered some of the turf.

So I'm thinking of an alternative - and please think of this only as a
maybe.  Suppose at the September board meeting I have a closed meeting on
the principles & scope & whatever else we can manage, and then have you
come in and talk to everybody in general session.  We could work out the
content of your talk, but it would be centered on the value of uniform
practices, their applicability to electric wholesale markets, and the
"EISB" approach.  Perhaps we could get Chuck Watson to help you.

There would be tough and probing questions - which you would know in
advance.

How does this sit with you?  I think it might be an interesting discussion
that would help to increase the collective knowledge and support.  I do not
have internal concurrence & support on this idea, but if you like it I'll
try to get it.

On another matter - I really need 5 or 6 examples  of areas where wholesale
electric practices would be useful and appropriate.  The question on the
floor is "Exactly what are the areas and types of practices we might
develop for wholesale electric markets?"

On the retail side the answer is easy, because we already have them (e.g.,
customer enrollment, billing & payments, metering,  load profiling, etc.).
But there really is no such list on the wholesale electric side.

Can you or Jeff help?  We can't just say "it's up to the members".  Having
a list would help demonstrate value.  I need something by next Thursday for
an internal strategy meeting.

Thanks
  -Mike

If a meeting is not possible, is it possible to get your committee's

The investigation crew is on site today at the Pontap Station leak site.  
(Reminder: Leaking nipple on the bottom of the tank released 1,085 BBLS of 
condensate into the soil inside the dike wall.)  

The first borehole encountered groundwater and sand at 18 feet below grade.  
When the drill stem was removed to sample the groundwater, the borehole 
immediately filled with oil, so groundwater could not be sampled.  The 
investigation will continue, but this is shaping up as a difficult 
remediation project.

The Senate Environment Committee has scheduled a markup of RFG/MTBE 
legislation for this coming Wednesday, July 26.   The Committee staff has 
released draft legislation from Chairman Bob Smith (R-NH) that will be the 
vehicle for consideration (a summary is attached).  

It is probable that the markup will not take place on Wednesday, and that the 
Committee's reason for scheduling the markup is really to "smoke out" 
potential amendments and positions of the affected industries.   In 
particular, there is a great deal of controversy surrounding the inclusion of 
a "renewable fuels" (ethanol) mandate in the bill, so the Committee wants to 
see how much opposition is raised by some of the parties.   There is 
currently no renewable fuel mandate in the draft Smith bill.  On one side, 
Governors of Midwest and Northeast states recently announced a "compromise" 
agreement on renewable fuels mandate language, and will be exerting a great 
deal of pressure to get this language included in the bill.   On the other 
side, Clean Air Subcommittee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-OK) is very opposed to 
ethanol language (as are refiners and MTBE producers) and could mount a 
substantial challenge to such provisions.   This could cause an ugly fight at 
markup, so staff's reason for scheduling a markup is likely to find out in 
advance how much pressure to expect from both sides.

Regardless of whether the markup occurs on Wednesday, we have prepared 
amendments and are lobbying on the issue with the expectation that the bill 
could be considered in September in the Environment Committee, or as a 
possible rider to one of the appropriations bills moving quickly through 
Congress.

I have attached a list of amendments that MTBE industry has produced that 
will likely be offered on our behalf at the markup.  Enron has led the 
drafting of amendments related to stranded costs and other incentives for 
MTBE producers, since the legislation would waive the RFG oxygen content 
requirement and phase out use of MTBE.   We are working with several Senators 
on the Environment Committee that will offer these amendments and speak on 
our behalf, including Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Bob Bennett 
(R-UT), and Craig Thomas (R-WY).

I will keep you updated on the progress of the legislation this week.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.

SMITH INTRODUCES BILL TO BAN MTBE IN REFORMULATED GASOLINE

Acknowledging the uphill battle that lies ahead, Senate Environment
Committee Chairman Bob Smith introduced on Thursday a bill to ban the
use of a key component in the Clean Air Act's reformulated gasoline
program.

As a sign of his intention to press ahead on the issue, Smith also
announced a full committee markup of the bill (S 2962) for Sept. 7.

Smith (R-N.H.) declared on the Senate floor: "We need to ban MTBE. ...
There will be no environmental backsliding."

Smith said he had hoped to introduce the bill a day earlier, but he was
still trying to solicit support from the main stakeholders on the issue.

Smith's bill would ban the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether, an
oxygenate used in 85 percent of reformulated gasoline, because of
groundwater contamination problems that have occurred in several states,
including New Hampshire.

While acknowledging that MTBE is effective in reducing air pollution,
Smith said it can migrate through the water table and has contaminated
drinking water supplies.

The ban of MTBE, a petroleum derivative used for years by the oil
industry, would boost dramatically the demand for ethanol, an
agriculture-based fuel that is the competing oxygenate in the
reformulated gasoline program.

Smith alluded to the tough negotiations he has had over the past six
months with the ethanol lobby and the petroleum industry. "There are
people who are dug in for various reasons," Smith said.

Smith has made the MTBE ban one of his top legislative priorities this
year. "It has to pass," Smith said. He also warned: "This is a tough,
tough issue. Everybody's not going to get what they want."

Smith promised that his bill "won't reduce the environmental benefits of
the Clean Air program."

In describing the main features of his bill, Smith said state governors
would have the option of waiving the 2 percent oxygenate requirement in
their state that is part of the reformulated gasoline program.

The Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which established the reformulated
gasoline program for the nation's most polluted cities, require that 2
percent by weight of a gallon of gasoline must be oxygen.

MTBE was the oxygenate of choice for the petroleum industry, because of
its abundance and cheap cost of production.

Smith said his bill also would give states the authority to ban the use
of MTBE within their state. EPA also would have the authority to ban
MTBE immediately. The bill itself would phase out MTBE within four
years.

Smith's bill also would provide $200 million from the leaking
underground storage tank fund to clean up MTBE-contaminated sites.

The bill would authorize EPA to conduct a study of the environmental
consequences of the nation's transportation fuel supply.

Smith noted that while Midwestern senators strongly support a boost for
ethanol, the alternative fuel has its own environmental problems. The
main concern is that ethanol prompts faster evaporation of gasoline into
the atmosphere, which is a concern in New England and in California.

Smith said he also was interested in establishing a program to boost the
development of non-petroleum-based, alternative transportation fuels. He
then introduced his own amendment to his own bill, based on draft
legislation that he had been circulating among members.

Smith acknowledged that a ban on MTBE would increase the cost of
reformulated gasoline. He estimated his proposal would cost consumers
approximately 3 cents to 4 cents per gallon extra in areas where
reformulated gasolines were required.

A proposal put forth by the ethanol industry -- to ban MTBE but keep the
2 percent oxygenate requirement, which would be met by ethanol -- would
cost 8 cents per gallon and was unacceptable, Smith said.

Smith said he disagreed with the Clinton administration's proposal to
ban MTBE and establish an ethanol mandate. He estimated the cost at 6
cents per gallon. "Let the markets decide," Smith said.

Smith also noted that the oil industry "is not real thrilled about
this."

Stan -

    Yesterday, Jim Templeton and I met with Mike Stites (sp?) at Conoco.  He
had very interesting ideas about when standards should be introduced to a
market, and noted his view that the power market was not ready yet for
standards -- either retail or wholesale.  I also spoke this week to Bill
Benham, who supports a broader scope for GISB with the provisos that gas
issues not become minimized, and that segments retain balance.  It looks like
the producers could be split in a vote to broaden GISB's scope.

    Veronica is working with your office to set up a conference call with
Alex DeBoissiere regarding the recent EEI Board meeting.  We should have some
material prepared prior to your meeting that might help.

    NERC is working with us to gain electric utility participation in the DOE
and FERC industry meetings.  Hopefully, with their participation they may
support a combined gas & electric standards organization.

Best Regards,  Rae

Driver; CONFIDENTIAL AND PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION AND 
ATTORNEY'S WORK PRODUCT


	


I believe most of you have seen the background/facts on this unfortunate 
accident in which (1) an ex-EOTT employee (Hildebrand) was killed and (2) a 
tank load of crude oil was emptied into a California river.  The oil belonged 
to Tosco.  We had/have a contract to haul this oil for Tosco and were 
performing through Cummings.  We outsourced our crude oil hauling function in 
California to Cummings and other companies last year, and many of our former 
crude drivers went to work for Cummings and these companies.  The oil has 
gone into navigable waters and has reached the Pacific Ocean (during spawning 
season).  This incident is on the front page of today's L.A. Times Metro 
Section. ACCORDING TO ED ATTANASIO,  NEITHER EOTT NOR ENRON IS MENTIONED IN 
THE TIMES COVERAGE.  It is quite possible that Tosco will seek indemnity from 
us (in connection with this incident) under the terms of our hauling contract 
with them.   The liabilities here for Tosco could be very significant.  Ed 
Attanasio is monitoring this situation closely.  

  We need to be sensitive to this situation for a number of reasons.  Someone 
may tie EOTT or Enron to this incident, for the reasons above, and because of 
the L.A. Times exposure, we could receive media calls about this matter.  
Scott Vonderheide has been alerted in this regard.  At this juncture, we need 
to decide where to refer any calls we receive on this matter.  Until further 
notice, I would advise that any and all such calls be referred to Cutty 
Cunningham .  Cutty, I think your response to any such calls should be that 
we did not own the truck or the oil, or employ the driver.  We should 
otherwise state that we are investigating the matter and have no further 
comment at this time.  Also, Lori and Molly,  we will need to decide very 
soon whether this matter will have any 10K significance. At the appropriate 
time, we should see what Baird thinks.  We will look to Cummings and their 
insurance carriers  to indemnify us----and be responsible for any claims 
against us by Tosco-----but we are still trying to ascertain the value of any 
such indemnity from Cummings and/ or its carriers. We don't have enough 
information at this time to speculate on the magnitude of any exposure we may 
have in this matter.  Ed Attanasio needs to confer with Susan Ralph and 
advise on this ASAP.  Please advise if there are any questions. Thanks.  SWD

sources.

Michael Burke resigned abruptly Friday from the chief executive's post
at crude oil pipeline operator EOTT Energy Partners.

The Houston company said its board of directors had accepted the
resignation of Burke, "effective immediately." Burke, 56, is leaving the

company "to focus on emerging investment and business opportunities,"
the company said in a written statement.

The partnership has lost money the last three years in a row but it was
profitable in the first quarter of this year with a net income of $2.2
million.

Burke's resignation came just days after the pipeline partnership
revised its first-quarter net income upward by $100,000.

The revisions were made as a result of a review of the company's
computerized marketing and accounting system, the company said. In a
filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the
computer problems resulted in "unexplained variances in financial
results
reported by the system."

Stanley Horton, chairman of EOTT , will assume the duties of chief
executive officer. Dana Gibbs, currently executive vice president and
chief
commercial officer, will become president and chief operating officer of

EOTT . Horton and Gibbs will comprise the office of the chairman for
EOTT .

Gas Rule
The Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on 
the discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:

Waiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on 
short-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September 
2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.
Seasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates 
for short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The 
Commission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a 
requirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate 
whether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any 
overcollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.
Term Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated 
rates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a 
Section 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.
Operational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the 
lines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between 
capacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation 
rules, (3) moving away from "command and control" imbalance/OFO provisions in 
favor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a 
requirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.
Real-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a 
real-time basis.
Right of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term 
contracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: 
(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates 
will have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and 
(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be 
required to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take 
effect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct 
rate for ROFR on a particular system.  
Not Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction 
requirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not 
authorize negotiated terms.


Clarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional 
Expedited Certificates
The Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for 
all Section 7 certificates.  During the
pendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities 
are in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement 
may be used to rebut the presumption.

With respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally 
sticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy 
policy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination 
expansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used 
in expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the 
best way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It 
does not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of 
applicability.


Keep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A 
written copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed 
review once I have seen the rule.

The market received the announcement of Larry's retirement and Bill's 
succession very calmly.   I talked to each of our analysts and elaborated a 
bit on the news and answered their questions:
 - Why is Larry leaving?  Was there any "hidden" reason? 
 -  What is Bill's background?
 - Does this signal any change in strategy or direction from Enron?
 - Do we anticipate any other change in the business as a result of this 
management change?

Several said that "since this seems to not be a big change (in direction or 
strategy), I'm not going to write anything on it".


The unit price did not reflect much change.   The units opened Monday (the 
day of the news) at $29, blipped up some 3/16  just after the press release, 
and then settled back to the opening price.   Tuesday opened strong, trended 
up $.50 in heavy volume and then again settled to $29.   Wednesday's price 
closed up 1/16, at $29.0625.

Daily volumes were:  Monday 27,400 units
            Tuesday 50,200 units
                 Wednesday 20,800 units

We were hoping to communicate that this would be a fairly seamless transition 
and continue NBP's history of solid, fairly conservative management, and it 
appears that the market interpretted it exactly that way.

I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less) 
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each 
Friday.  You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him 
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

Thanks,
Stan

PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL


Please see the request that was made by the Navajo EPA to Larry Campbell (one 
of our New Mexico Division Environmental Specialists) below.  The Navajo EPA 
has no jurisdiction over pipeline safety and there is a serious question as 
to whether the  expertise exists within the Navajo EPA to interpret the 
corrosion records we keep.   

Dave Johnson and John Shafer have advised the lads to funnel this request and 
similar requests through our p/l safety group, legal and the VP of Operations 
and be extermely careful in our responses.  However, this request presents 
its own special issues.  I'll speak to John Gormley and ask him to say simply 
that he will pass the request along.

Rather than respond indiviually, it seems we would wish to coordinate a 
response with at least El Paso and Questar.  Thgts??

Subject: Corrosion Records Request for Pipeline on the Navajo Nation

I received a call from Ronnie Ben (520) 871-7995 of the Navajo Nation EPA 
requesting corrosion records for all pipelines owned by Transwestern on the 
Navajo Nation.  We talked for awhile and I informed him that John Gormley in 
Albuquerque handled corrosion on those portions of the Transwestern line on  
reservation lands.  He said that he would be contacting John and a request 
will be made for all corrosion records and compliance activities for 
pipelines on the reservation. This may be a ripple effect from the El Paso 
incident near Carlsbad, N.M. which happened a couple of weeks ago.

Stan, 
This my understanding of the proposal
In lieu of cash bonus for 1999:
Number of options on EOTT sub units:  Dana Gibbs 80,000  Mike Burke  100,000
Option on sub units @ $5.57/unit
50% awarded when EOTT meets distribution on common units on four consecutive 
quarters
The balance awarded when EOTT meets and pays distribution on all units for 
four consecutive quarters
(Theoretically this could all happen over the next four quarters)
When options on sub units are earned Gibbs and Burke will receive their share 
of distributions that are paid for sub units ( to align Burke and Gibbs 
interests with Enron)
Cost of this program will be paid by Enron.

Stan, I hope this captures the essence of the proposal.  Thanks for investing 
time in this.

Dear task force members,

At the conclusion of the call, we said we would include a motion for the
intent of the Board, (see below).  Please let me know if you have any changes:

It is the intent of the Board of Directors to endorse a direction that GISB
change its organization to permit the development of retail and wholesale
standards for the natural gas and electric markets, assuming that the
industry evidences sufficient commitment within the next 90 days, both
monetarily and with necessary manpower, to support such efforts.  The changes
to the GISB organization would be structured to ensure fair and balanced
representation for all industry segments -- both gas & electric.

As we discussed and a reminder, we should quickly move to structure an 
employment agreement for David Hultsman.
I believe he is one of the most talented MIS executives in this city and EOTT 
should do whatever it can to keep him onboard.
Stan, if you concur, I will ask David to give me the some idea of what he 
would like to see in the way of terms and conditions.
thanks,  mike

The Red Rock expansion needs to get  approval at the May 1st Board meeting.  
The procedure is to submit it to the Finance Committee of the Board for 
approval . Assuming the Finance Committee approves the project they would 
recommend it to the Board for approval.  By this memo, I am requesting that 
Rod coordinate with Rick Buy to get it on the Finance Committee agenda.

I will be in town for both the Board meeting and the Finance Committee 
meetings.  If formal presentations are required at the Finance Committee we 
can decide who should do them.  It is my understanding that no presentation 
needs to be done at the Board meeting.  I will check with Jeff to see if he 
wants a formal presentation to the Finance Committee or if he will do it 
himself.

Subject: Background Materials for the INGAA Board Meeting


Bob,
I generally prepare a package of briefing materials for Stan Horton prior to 
INGAA Board meetings.  Since you are attending in his place, I'm planning on 
doing the same for you.  I'll forward a complete package tomorrow.  In the 
meantime, I wanted to give you a heads up on two issues that will likely come 
up at the meeting.


Pipeline safety.  There is a great deal of activity  of this issue.  The 
accident in Bellingham Washington has politicians taking the opportunity to 
push for tougher state oversight authority and more money to the states.  
Last week a grass roots group called the National Pipeline Coalition met to 
rally support for state oversight.  INGAA's general reaction has been to 
distinguish gas and liquids lines and refer to the gas pipeline safety 
record.  To the extent that we have distinquishing factual (not hypothetical) 
date,  think this information will be useful in any substantive pipeline 
safety legislation.  However, the more immediate issue is appropriations.  
Jeff Keehler reports that while safety legislation is not likely this year, 
he is certain that we will confront appropriations issues in the form of 
higher user fees.  INGAA's approach has been to say absolutely that user fees 
for gas pipelines should not be increased.  When we met with Stan Horton last 
week, he felt like we should develop a compromise position on some level of 
user fee increases that we could support if spent on pipeline damage 
prevention (one call) and other public education efforts.  Jeff agrees that a 
compromise might be a good political solution, allowing the Washington 
congressional members to claim victory in bringing home more money to the 
states.  Jeff plans to finish his memo on our compromise position in the next 
day or so.  The next step will be convincing INGAA to look at some compromise 
rather than flatly rejecting user fees.  It may be appropriate for Enron to 
ask that INGAA set up a meeting of the Board level safety task force to 
consider such a compromise.
Electric Restructuring Legislation.  Cynthia Sanherr informs me that several 
of the combined gas/electric utility members (e.g. Duke) are lobbying INGAA 
to change its position on pending electric legislation in a direction that is 
counter Enron's interests.  I need to get more detailed notes from Cynthia 
and will include in your Board package.  She expects this to come up at the 
Board meeting.

Stan,

The producers put together another strawman, attached.  It will probably be
discussed today at the task force meeting.

I spoke with Peggy's office ( she will not be in until right before the 
meeting), and the fees within the Enron group that might apply to us are as 
follows:\

EOG:  Directors:  flat retainer of $8,750/quarter ( no per meeting/attendance 
fee)
  Each Chairman of a committee received an additional  flat $2,500 retainer 
for their service

Northern Border:  No outside Directors that are paid by Enron: 
Audit Committee receives flat retainer of $3,750, and $1,000/meeting.  

She is going to check further to see if anyone has any additional input as to 
a norm.  I will let you know and will talk to Peggy further also this 
afternoon.

Cutty is very enthusiastic about joining the EOTT team and taking on the 
"insurmountable challege".  He is also willing to begin initially with an 
organizational structure that has 
           administrative/commercial reporting to the Regional Business 
Managers and functional/technical reporting to Operations Governance.  He is 
planning on joing us on 2/1/2000 and I know he will make a major contribution 
to our future success.

There are a number of superb initiatives that are being developed and 
implemented 
throughout EOTT that will collectively profoundly change and improve our 
company.
I will give you periodic updates on these initiatives throughout the year.

As an example, Priscilla Norton is doing excellent work to develop more 
accurate and 
appropriate truck cost guides.  This tool is giving us much better knowledge 
about the
true cost to transport crude oil in specific areas across our systems.  As in 
most 
everything we do, this is a real team effort.

I have asked Priscilla to briefly describe this tool and it implementation 
below:
=============================================================

"I developed the Fleet TIME Tool  because I wanted to allocate costs as 
accurately as possible to the individual lease level.   In the past fleet 
cost allocation was based on district averages allocated based primarily on 
miles.   The TIME Tool differs from past practice because it uses actual 
truck hours spent on every EOTT truck haul.  A district cost per hour is then 
established based on number of truck-hours operated in each district, and 
total fleet operating dollars spent in each district.  Using the hourly 
district rate, the Tool calculates district cost per barrel for each ticket 
based on actual truck time consumed.  The resulting data is vital information 
because even though we may already know a district averages 70 cents per 
barrel, we will now know which leases are $0.45 per barrel and which are 
$1.10 per barrel. This improved understanding of actual cost per barrel at 
the lease level paves the way for a much better understanding of lease 
profitability.   With this information, Marketing  can become more 
aggressive, competitive, and confident about our costs when bidding on new 
barrels, and Operations Managers can more easily identify opportunities to 
optimize fleet costs.  

The Fleet District Managers and Marketing have been receptive to the TIME 
concept  and very helpful in providing feedback.    Although the concept of 
TIME as our key cost driver is still in its infancy, Marvin Mills is already 
using the information to identify opportunities to reduce his costs in 
Kansas.    Willie Seale and Phil Elliot  have been using TIME data to 
identify Stations where EOTT could bid the barrels out at a lower cost than 
EOTT's internal cost, and to identify marginal leases to be rebid or 
terminated.     Bennie Orr has been using the TIME philosophy when 
Ark-La-Tex  bids on new business because the Tool has convinced him that 
mileage, by itself  is not a true indicator of cost.  Our biggest struggle 
right now is just getting adequate timely data to meet our needs.

With the help of Patrick Scales, the TIME Tool is currently being moved to a 
server platform using the new Brio software.  Eventually the Tool should 
allow us to have near real-time data at our finger tips.   Future plans 
include adding pipeline barrels and tariff rates to the Tool in order to be 
able to see both pipeline and truck business in the same tool (essential for 
analyzing customers who have both pipeline and truck barrels).  Within the 
next week, we plan to roll the Server version of the TIME Tool out to at 
least one outlying office to begin testing functionality and accuracy, and to 
identify any performance issues.  

Our goal is that the TIME Tool move EOTT to a much greater understanding of 
cost/profitability at the lease level."

Priscilla Norton

Attached is a statement by OFA reacting to last night's "60 Minutes" story 
about MTBE.

The program was not overly critical of MTBE producers, in fact the industry 
was rarely mentioned.  The story omitted altogether footage from an interview 
done with OFA.  However it hit EPA and refiners hard about 1) not thoroughly 
investigating the potential harm to groundwater MTBE could cause and 2) once 
learning of that harm, not acting quickly enough to do something about that 
harm.

The story will give added traction to legislation currently being considered 
by Congress that would provide states with the ability to apply for a waiver 
to the oxygenate requirement or even ban MTBE altogether.   To that end, we 
are drafting legislative language for attachment to any oxygenate/MTBE bills 
that would provide stranded costs for U.S. MTBE producers, retroactive to the 
point before Enron took the after-tax charge on the MTBE asset.

Also, because EPA was criticized for its inaction, EPA will likely give 
expedited consideration to the state of California's request for an oxygenate 
waiver.  A regulatory grant of California's request would eliminate the need 
for Rep. Bilbray's California-only legislation, and could complicate the 
passage of more national-focused legislation.   While a regulatory fix is a 
possibility, and could have more immediate negative impact than legislation, 
a regulation of this nature would be immediately challenged in court on 
several grounds by MTBE producers.

I will keep you informed about any developments on the MTBE issue.  Please 
let me know if you receive are any inquiries from policy makers or media in 
the wake of the 60 Minutes story.

Stan:  V&E wrote/masterminded the partnership agreement for our MLP.  It is 
complicated and has been amended several times.  In view of these factors, 
V&E should tell us whether we can use the $2.5 million of cash from the 
insurance recovery to retroactively reclaim a portion of the 4th quarter 
API's.  In particular, Baird should give us this opinion since he has handled 
the partnership agreement since day one.

Baird is gone on vacation for the next week.  He is planning to give us an 
answer within a few days of his return.  He will give the matter serious 
thought, but what we are asking is pretty aggressive.  His associate, Carlos 
Pena, has reviewed the partnership agreement and his first take on the 
question is that we cannot revise the available cash for the fourth quarter 
in this way.  But the matter requires far more thought than this----and Bob 
will also need to talk with Lori (also gone on vacation) to come up with a 
meaningful answer for us.

I will stay after this, but in light of the above, it will probably be early 
July b/f we get V&E's final position on this.  If this won't do, please let 
me know and I'll explore other avenues of getting an answer out of V&E.  
Thanks.  SWD

Corporate comp is relooking at your contract based on our converstion..ieyou 
would be entitled to severance payment eqyual to 2 year salary and bonus 
should you decide to leave the company provided that all or substantially all 
of the Azurix assts other than ?Wessex and Azurix Bu7enos Aires are sold.

I will meet with Jim Derrick today to discuss John Ale.

With regard to Beckett and Glasford; their agreements provide for retention 
bonuses provided they stay until September 16th.  If they voluntarily leave 
before that they get nothing.  There is no employment agreements in place 
that link anything to comparable positions titles or anything else.  Should 
we move them over to Enron in Director positions and they are subsequently 
offerred positions elsewhere in Enron ( once we dispose of non-Wessex and ABA 
assets) at Director positions, then they have a choice of  accepting those 
positions or voluntarily terminating.  Since there is no contractual 
agreements with these two I do not want to offer any kind of enhanced 
severance payments to them.  I have contacted Ben Glisan regarding Glasford 
and he is polling his people about their view on an appropiate placement for 
him.

I will talk with you when you return.

Thanks.

PM-ME--MTBE Lawsuit, Bjt,600
     Associated Press

     Friday, March 3, 2000

     Judge rejects class-action status for MTBE lawsuit
     By MICHELLE EMERY=
     Associated Press Writer=

     PORTLAND, Maine (AP) _ A judge has ruled not to give
     class-action status to a lawsuit a handful of Maine well owners filed
     against the makers of the gasoline additive MtBE.

     Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Roland A. Cole ruled
     Thursday that the suit should not encompass all Maine well owners. He
     said there are too many different ways that MtBE, or methyl tertiary
     butyl ether, can cause well contamination, such as through spills or
     leaking underground tanks.

     Cole ruled that the lawsuit the five homeowners filed against
     the manufacturers does not adequately encompass the MtBE concerns of
     all well owners.

     Cole wrote in his ruling that the plaintiffs' decision to
     exclude personal injury cases and claims against ``actual spillers''
     could preclude class members with contaminated wells from suing for
     other damages. He added that class members whose wells have lower
     levels of MtBE would be barred from receiving damages to clean up
     their wells.

     ``I think it's a mistake, and it doesn't quite hold up under
     real world facts,'' said the plaintiffs' lawyer, Jon Hinck.

     ``Well owners in the state of Maine are going to have to proceed on
     their own to get their well-water tested for MtBE contamination, and
     pursue their own legal remedies,'' he said.

     Plaintiffs sought to have the Atlantic Richfield Co., the Arco
     Chemical Co. and the Lyondell Chemical Co., manufacturers of MtBE, pay
     to test 250,000 wells in Maine for MtBE contamination and to
     clean up any contamination found. They say the companies failed to
     warn about water contamination dangers and exaggerated air-quality
     benefits.

     The defendants argue that state and federal environmental
     officials knew about the risk MtBE posed to groundwater. They decided
     the clean-air benefits of gasoline reformulated with high levels of
     MtBE outweighed contamination concerns, defense lawyer William Kayatta
     said.

     Kayatta said testing and cleanup would cost more than $15
     million.

     ``The court recognized that these were at best novel and
     untested claims,'' Kayatta said.

     ``The court recognized that the plaintiffs were hoping to hold the
     manufacturers liable for contamination of their wells regardless of
     the fact that the contamination and spills were caused by others, and
     we thought that was unfair,'' he said.

     The defendants' next move will be to file a motion to dismiss
     the lawsuit, Kayatta said.

     ``We don't think there is any basis, and now that's the issue,'' he
     said.

     Hinck said he was encouraged by Cole's statement in his ruling that
     MtBE contamination is a problem.

     ``Their cases are viable, and they're going forward,'' he said,
     adding that other individual well owners may join the lawsuit.

     Hinck is assisting with a similar effort in North Carolina, where
     well owners are trying to get class-action status for a lawsuit
     against oil companies.

     MtBE, a possible carcinogen, moves more quickly through soil and
     water than other components of gasoline. Long-term exposure has caused
     cancer in lab animals, but there is not enough data to say whether it
     also will cause cancer in humans. Its use was mandated in 16 states as
     a way to cut down on air pollution.

     Maine stopped using reformulated gasoline with high levels of MtBE
     last May, after state studies found about 15 percent of wells tested
     had been contaminated with the additive. Residents in several other
     states, including New Hampshire, New Jersey, California and
     Connecticut, also have grown concerned about MtBE contamination.

On behalf of EOTT,  I would like to express our appreciation for all of the 
help and support which was received from ENRON during the Pacific acquisition 
attempt. Without this type of support, any attempt at a meaningful bid would 
not have been possible. Dwight deserves a lions share of the credit for 
tending to all of the details and coordinating all of the many aspects to 
this effort.

Again, thank all of you very much.


Joe

Subject: MTBE legislation

Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Attached is the front section of the 1999 Enron Annual Report.  Each of the 
operating sections have been through a few rounds of edits at the operating 
company level.  While you are seeing the Chairman's Letter for the first 
time, it has also been through the PR and IR departments for general 
direction and consistency with the operating sections.  Not included in this 
file are the two page spreads that use a more graphic-oriented approach to 
illustrate a particular highlight.  Those highlighted segments are:  Peaking 
Plants, EnronOnline, Owens Corning, EBS, and Transwestern/Gallup.  We also 
feature a two-column "callout" on the Phase II financing for Dabhol.  I will 
send those items in layout form for the next round of edits.  Each of the 
spreads have been through numerous operating company reviews.

 Please send me your comments on this copy by Friday, Feb. 11.

Subject: People v. Koch Status Report

 Four current EOTT employees were interviewed by Koch counsel last Friday, 
March 31, in Bakersfield re People v. Koch. These interviews were informal, 
in the sense that the witnesses were not under oath, and no verbatum 
transcript of the proceedings was created. 

 Prior to that time, Koch's counsel of record, an LA lawyer from a very small 
firm, did all the investigation himself.  On Friday, he was joined by two 
lawyers from Munger, Tolles and Olson, which is a pretty heavy hitter LA 
litigation firm.  In response to my pre-interview inquiry, they stated that 
they were lawyers for Koch conducting an internal investigation of the 
allegations of this lawsuit.  During this conversation, they also represented 
taht the DA told them that no employees are targets of the DA's 
investigation.  They conceded, however, that this could change if the DA 
changed his mind.

 While this matter is a civil action, its allegations are pretty severe and 
constitute potentially criminal conduct.  Certain former Koch employees, some 
of whom are now employed by EOTT, are accused of running equipment out of 
compliance with air regs, instructing other Koch employees to run equipment 
out of compliance with air regs, altering equipment to cause it to be out of 
compliance, altering company records to cover up violations, and generally 
obstructing State Air Pollution Inspectors in the perfomance of their 
duties.  NONE OF THIS CONDUCT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE OCCURRED ON EOTT'S WATCH. 

 Based on our contract with Koch, we have been cooperating with their 
investigation of the facts underlyng this suit by making witnesses 
available   However, given the potentially criminal nature of allegations, I 
have advised all EOTT personnel during their pre-interviews that, while these 
are just allegations, they are potentially serious, and if they are 
uncomfortable with continuing at any time, they ahould inform me and I will 
stop the interview so they can seek the advice of an independent counsel.  I 
was also prepared to strongly urge any employee who implicated himself in 
potentially criminal misconduct during the pre-interview not to proceed but, 
rather, to get a lawyer to advise him.  Fortunately this did not happen; all 
of our people deny participation in the alleged wrongdong.

 One of our employees said he was present when the former plant manager, who 
does not work for us, told a couple of employees to record false information 
in company records in order to hide events of non-compliance.  Other than 
that, nothing of much interest came up.

 Naturally, this lawsuit has some of our people concerned about their 
reputations and possible exposure.  While it is in EOTT's best interest to 
comply with Koch's requests for information (based on the 12/1/98 contract 
requirements), it might not be in certain individuals' best interest to 
ultimately give testimony in this case without first getting immunity from 
prosecution.  Therefore, if this goes any further (ie. to depostions, etc.) I 
would like to express the concerns of these employees to Koch and inquire as 
to whether Koch will pay for them to get independent counsel to advise them.  
Hopefully, they'll just settle the thing, and we won't have to deal with it 
anymore, but if they don't, I like to try to make sure our guys know their 
rights vis a vis the district attorney.

 Your thoughts? --Ed.

This is further to my prior E-mail.  I think we should wait until Bob gets

Steve:

My initial read of the partnership agreement is that the cash from the
insurance settlement should be treated as a cash item in the second quarter.
This is based on the definition of "Available Cash" (defined to include "all
cash receipts of the Partnership during such quarter from all sources") and
Section 5.3 (which provides that "Within 45 days following the end of . . .
each calendar quarter commencing with the calendar quarter beginning on July
1, 1994, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such
period or quarter shall be distributed in accordance with this Article V by
the Partnership to the Partners").  My reading is that the settlement money
is a "cash receipt" during the second quarter and must be distributed as
Available Cash.

Bob thought this question deserved a thorough review and was hoping to be
involved in its resolution. Based on his impression from the last meeting,
he thought he would have an opportunity to look at it after his vacation. He
may have some additional thoughts on the analysis, so please let me know how
you would like to proceed.

As most of you know, we have signed a Memorandum Of Understanding with 
Equilon on this project.  Joe Richards will call a "kick-off" meeting on this 
deal for next Wednesday, and at that time, we will begin dividing up due 
diligence assignments and areas of responsibility.  In my view, we will learn 
a lot in the first two or three weeks of due diligence about our ultimate 
chances for closing this transaction.  Three big areas we will need to get a 
handle on are: (1) The dollar magnitude of the environmental responsibilities 
we would be taking on; (2) The quality/condition of Equilon's real property 
(ROW) records; and (3) Any major commercial/business/contractual issues 
surrounding this deal.

"Disclosure" is an important concept in this process.  If the deal moves 
forward and we become more confident of closure, we will, at some point, have 
to make some sort of announcement to the public about this transaction.  We 
DON'T want to do this now, or any time in the near future, because the deal 
is too uncertain/tentative at this particular juncture and we do not to say 
anything that could prove misleading.

Equilon has sent out a verbal notice to their field supervisors that they are 
in exclusive talks with a potential buyer (us).  At our request, they have 
not identified EOTT as the potential purchaser.  If they were to identify us 
at this point, and if word were to get out "on the street" about this pending 
deal, we might be forced into making some sort of premature disclosure, and 
we don't want that.  Accordingly, it is imperative that we all keep as quiet 
about this deal as possible (for now) and that we not discuss it in any 
shape/form/fashion with anyone outside of our company (other than our 
lawyers), or with anyone inside of EOTT who does not "need to know."  In 
particular, we have to make a concerted effort to make sure that "our" field 
people don't start talking with" their" field people about this deal.

There is always some degree of leakage in these matters, but we must do our 
best to minimize it----so we will not have to disclose this deal until we are 
ready. Please advise if there are any questions, and please share these 
thoughts, as and when appropriate, with the appropriate people within your 
respective groups.  Thanks.  SWD

To followup on your comment Stan, to sell the line,  this is already sold 
with certificate authority to KN, however, they have requested an extension 
until 7/31 to allow Oneok to review and decide.  this is part of the 
Skelleytown system, and it is the area that we want sold--   I don't believe 
that we have granted them the extended date  yet and maybe we can use this in 
conjuction with the Hobbs line where we didn't get the required info on 
pressure for maop purposes.  Just some thoughts--  MK

 I asked El Paso's investment bankers (Credit Suisse First Boston) to permit 
us to disclose to our minority Partners, Williams and TransCanada,  that we 
have an offer outstanding to purchase Midwestern pipeline.   We would prefer 
to mention this offer to Williams first, to obtain their buy in on the 
strategy of acquiring it through NBPL rather than at the MLP level.   We sent 
the bankers revised Confidentiality Agreements for their review.  However, 
the only feedback from the bankers is that the two primary contacts are "out 
of the country".   Therefore, I may not  be able to mention this at 
tomorrow's meeting.

I also received a call today from Luralene Tapahe, Esq. of the NNERTF and the
Department of Justice concerning another client. I took advantage of the call
to discuss with Ms. Tapahe my discussion of March 16th with Akhtar Zaman and
she generally confirmed what Mr. Zaman had told me.

Ms. Tapahe also advised me that as of today, no replacement on the NNERTF from
the President's Office had been made for Sharon Noel, Esq. whom, as you know,
is (acting) Chief of Staff and, apparently, will be too busy to serve on the
NNERTF.

As you probably know, there is a big meeting in Window Rock next week called 
by
President Begaye to discuss whether the Navajo Nation should try to charter 
its
own bank (more broadly, on the subject of how to find capital for 
development).
The cast of characters for this meeting is quite impressive. If anyone wants a
copy of the agenda, please let me know.

Finally, I attended a meeting of the Navajo Nation Council's Judiciary
Committee yesterday. After some spirited debate, they agreed to recommend to
the full Council a "Little Tucker Act" with a limited waiver of sovereign
immunity to enforce contracts.

Larry Ruzow met with the Navajo DOJ (a Jim Fitting, Esq. ) yesterday 
afternoon on another matter.  In the course of the meeting,
Mr. Fitting made clear that the DOJ will oppose any deal that calls for 
disputes to be adjudicated in any
forum other than the Navajo Nation Courts (and that this meant DOJ opposition 
to arbitration as well.)

Larry expressed that we should not expect Ms. Tapahe (who is more militant on 
sovereignty-related
issues) to be willing to compromise on forum issues. 

He did remind me of the Resources Committee process.

At this point we will attempt a meeting regardless and report back on 
progress.

I apologize for not thanking you earlier for sponsoring the INGAA dinner last 
month.  I truly enjoyed the informal setting of the dinner, providing my 
thoughts on energy related issues, and hearing the views of those who 
attended the dinner.  Hopefully, the dinner guests received some value for 
their attendance.

On another front, I hope everything went smooth for the big move, although I 
missed your participation at the lunch that Ken Lay had for me and others.  
It is clear that gas issues are on the back burner these days, and that 
electric related matters and e-commerce are just more daunting and 
interesting.  Of course, that is where the money--profit-- will be in the 
future.

On a more personal note, I wish you and Debbie the best, and hope your new 
arrivals will bring you so much joy.

Stan -
Late last week, I spoke with Roxane Richter regarding the GISB article in the
"Houston: Energy Capital" document.  She may want a quote from you as our
chairman and willing to provide you with several.  The document will be
widely distributed throughout Houston, energy companies and energy trade
shows.  As soon as I get a draft, I will forward it on to you and the other
Editorial Review Board members.  Rae

The article below describes two separate paths that EPA is considering for 
regulating MTBE.  They are also considering action on a request from the 
state of California to grant its request for an oxygenate waiver through 
regulatory means.  Taken in conjunction with the increased interest on 
Capitol Hill for moving oxygenate waiver or MTBE phase out legislation, the 
future does not look very bright for MTBE.  

We will continue to pursue on Capitol Hill our Enron-developed approach which 
proposes stranded cost recovery and liability protection for US MTBE 
producers. The House and Senate will be moving forward with hearings and 
legislation shortly, and we will keep you posted on our efforts and other 
developments.

1. AIR POLLUTION/WATER POLLUTION
--------------------------------

EPA FLOATS TWO PROPOSALS AFFECTING MTBE, REFORMULATED GASOLINE

     The Environmental Protection Agency has advanced proposals dealing
with the touchy issues of methyl tertiary butyl ether regulation and with
the reformulated gasoline program to the White House Office of Management
and Budget, and although the two proposals are being kept under wraps they
have already spurred controversy and debate.

     Both items were forwarded to OMB Feb. 15 and both will appear in
the Federal Register probably after 90 days of OMB review, the standard
time allotted for such proposals.

     With neither proposal having been made public, speculation abounds
about both.

     The first item -- which is being reviewed by OMB as an advanced
notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) -- aims to control MTBE, a synthetic
"oxygenate" added to gasoline to lower emissions of air pollutants. The
Clean Air Act mandates that certain urban areas with high levels of air
pollution contain 2 percent-by-weight level of oxygenates in their gasoline
in order to reduce emissions of ozone-forming hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide. To comply with this reformulated gas (RFG) mandate, MTBE is
relied on for over 80 percent of the gasoline, ethanol is used in almost 15
percent, and other oxygenates make up for the remaining amount.

     Although MTBE has been heralded for its role in reducing air
emissions, it is under attack because of environmental contamination,
particularly to groundwater. In fact, both the Senate and House have plans
to move legislation to allow states to waive the oxygenate mandate, and
California has requested a waiver from the RFG requirements, an issue that
could induce other states that have problems with MTBE contamination to
take similar action.

     Now, however, EPA appears poised to take action of its own.
According to sources, the EPA plan would seek to control MTBE under the
Toxic Substances Control Act. TSCA provides EPA the authority to prohibit
certain chemicals or substances if the agency concludes it "presents or
will present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment."

     "MTBE clearly meets this test," claimed Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-
Calif.), who has in the past fought to have MTBE phased out.

     However, Terry Wigglesworth, executive director of the Oxygenated
Fuels Association, which represents MTBE producers, argued otherwise. "TSCA
is not a good technical choice," she said of EPA's proposal. Among the
hurdles EPA will face with the proposal, she predicted, is that under TSCA,
EPA must look at the risks to human health and the environment, "but there
are enormous air quality benefits due to MTBE use, for example there have
been significant reductions in ozone and air toxic emissions, such as
benzene."

     "Also under TSCA, EPA must determine if the risk could be reduced
by other federal laws already being administered," she explained, pointing
specifically to the underground storage tank program, which she said has
not been complied with too well.

     In a Feb. 22 letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, Boxer said,
"Some critics of this approach argue that MTBE contamination may be
controlled by upgrading our underground storage tanks. This won't solve the
MTBE problem, however, because we now know that even those new tanks leak."
She also said, "MTBE poses a more pervasive water contamination problem
than the other harmful constituents of gasoline like benzene because it
moves through water faster, farther and persists longer than those
constituents."

     Whether EPA's proposal would entail banning, phasing out or capping
MTBE use is unclear and was disputed among various sources. However, one
industry source said that EPA was not taking a stance on that issue and
would first take public comment through the ANPR and proposed rule.

     Although sources indicated that the ANPR would not typically be
printed in the Federal Register until the 90-day review period has expired,
"We heard EPA asked OMB to fast track it," one industry source said. And a
federal government source also hinted that the proposal would be reviewed
very quickly.

     The second proposal is shrouded in even more ambiguity. What is
certain is that the proposal would entail an "adjustment" to RFG, as stated
by an OMB source.

     Environmental and industry sources said that the hints they've
gotten indicate that the proposal entails an offset for carbon monoxide.
According to these sources, EPA has discussed this option with stakeholders
in the past.

     Under the proposal, certain RFG provisions concerning emissions of
volatile organic compounds would be loosened as long as there were
significant reductions in CO emissions. VOCs are blamed for ozone
production, and carbon monoxide also contributes to ozone.

     According to an environmentalist, this proposal would encourage
increased reliance on ethanol by refineries.

     Wigglesworth spoke against this proposal, saying, "Any loosening of
requirements to maintain actual air quality benefits that we've achieved
through cleaner burning gasoline that would turn back the clock on cleaner
air or air quality would be unacceptable."

Stan-
If there is anything I can do or get Mike to do in order to pull his team 
together then please let me know.   I am open to any suggestions or concerns 
you may have.  

Mike has expressed an interest in me becoming a leader in developing the 
culture and morale (Manager, Employee & Community Relations) of EOTT.  I feel 
I can do an extremely good job at this....and could even do a better job if I 
had the help and support of Enron.  Please let me know your thoughts on 
this....I feel that being engaged more with Enron will show a significant 
difference at EOTT.  I think it is real important for EOTT Employees to feel 
like we are part of Enron....
(as you know, being a part of such a highly respected company adds quite a 
bit of value....as well as pride!)

Some ideas: 
 1.  Tapping into Enron's training and development
 2.  Benefits
 3.  Employee Recognition Programs
 4.  Overall ideas Enron has that will assist in team building
 5.  Mentoring Programs

I just want you to know that I am willing to take on whatever task you would 
like to hand to me....I am also very interested in finding out how EOTT can 
benefit from Enron....anyone that you feel I should contact at Enron...please 
let me know!  

I am ready to help make EOTT a wonderful and HAPPY place to work.....(maybe 
even a name change wouldn't be such a bad idea....)

Thanks for listening!
Shelly

In the executive committee meeting today, the EOTT Board strongly emphasized 
that they want us to vigorously pursue
criminal prosecution through V&E.  They also said the V&E attorneys you are 
working with are brilliant, but they are "not mean enough".  They 
specifically mentioned John Holsted of V&E, who "looks mean and is mean as a 
junk yard dog".

John Duncan lamented that one of his former business partners, Steve Cook, 
had committed criminal activities relative
to their business partnership.  But even with "plenty of hard evidence 
against COOK' he was not successfully prosecuted 
because the prosecutors found more interesting things to work on.

I assured our Board that you will stay on top of this case and press hard for 
several years of prison time and hopefully 
get a public flogging as well.

In Congress' final effort to pass remaining appropriations bills this year, 
there have been rumors circulating that an attempt may be made to soemhow 
insert pipeline safety legislation.  While several members have kept the 
issue on their "wish lists" of items they would like to see in last-minute 
appropriations legislation, most would prefer that pipeline safety be dealt 
with in the next Congress -- see the attached article referencing Sen. John 
McCain's desire to handle it next year.  I would consider it highly unlikely 
to see pipeline safety included in the final package.

__________________

MCCAIN WANTS PIPELINE SAFETY BILL OUT OF FINAL SPENDING PACKAGE:
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has asked the Senate 
leadership to keep a pipeline safety overhaul out of the final appropriations 
bill. In a letter to Majority Leader Trent Lott, Miss., and Appropriations 
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, McCain expressed reservations about 
inclusion of the pipeline bill (S 2438), which the Senate passed by unanimous 
consent on Sept. 7. McCain wrote that while he supports the legislation, he 
does not want authorizing provisions in the final appropriations bill. He 
added that the legislation "is the product of months of work and bipartisan 
negotiations by the Senate Commerce Committee ... and should in no way be 
weakened to appease organized labor or any other special interest group." The 
measure failed in the House Oct. 10. The 232-158 vote fell short of the 
two-thirds majority required for passage under suspension of the rules.

FYI -- This will hit the news later today or tomorrow....


WASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton administration has decided to phase out MTBE as 
a gasoline additive on grounds it poses a risk to public health or the 
environment,  government sources said today.

MTBE, a leading oxygenate and octane booster, reduces emissions of smog, but 
it has been linked to groundwater pollution in California and elsewhere. It 
is used in one-third of
the gasoline sold in the United States.

Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was 
announcing this afternoon that her agency will seek to "significantly reduce 
or eliminate" use of MTBEs
under the Toxic Substance Control Act. That law allows EPA to ban chemicals 
"deemed to pose an unreasonable risk to the public or the environment," said 
a government official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

The agency also will ask Congress for changes in the Clean Air Act that will 
encourage use of ethanol, an additive from corn, in place of MTBE, according 
to a congressional source. The 1990 law requires the use of oxygenates in 
gasoline.

The EPA previously has said it has no authority to regulate MTBE, and 
Congress should act to limit its use in light of evidence the additive is 
contaminating groundwater.  MTBE is used in all or part of 16 states, and is 
in much of the gasoline sold in the Northeast. Refiners turned to the 
additive after the Clean Air Act required gasoline in areas with serious air 
pollution to contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.

Last summer, an EPA advisory panel said that while current levels of MTBE in 
water pose no health risk, its use should be dramatically curtailed because 
of potential widespread water
pollution problems. MTBE has been found to be a carcinogen and poses health 
and environmental risks, other critics of the additive have said.

The sources said the EPA action was a "backstop measure" because Congress had 
not acted to eliminate use of MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether.

California, which has more leeway than other states to regulate air 
pollution, has already decided to ban the use of MTBE by the end of 2002. 
State officials have asked the EPA for
a waiver from the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirements so that the state 
doesn't have to switch to ethanol, which is more expensive than MTBE.

A coalition of Northeast states said last year said that low levels of MTBE 
were found in 15 percent of the drinking water tested in the Northeast, in 
most cases in amounts less than 2 parts per billion. Water begins to pose a 
health concern and tastes or smells bad at 30 to 70 parts per billion; about 
1 percent of water supplies tested in the Northeast had concentrations above 
35 parts per billion.

Attached is a draft of the RFP for the NBP debt financing.  We recommend 
sending this RFP to:
A.G. Edwards
Banc One
Bank of America
Bank of Tokyo
CIBC
SunTrust

These institutions are either agents for a NBPL or NBP credit facility and/or 
recently have indicated a strong interest in doing future business with NBP.  
In recent discussions, several firms have advised NBP to proceed with a 
public market transaction for the term debt.  Given their predilection for 
private placement debt, A.G. Edwards has been included so that we get two 
views on the appropriate market for the term debt issue.

You will note we have not including Lehman Brothers in our recommendation.  
As I indicated to you last week by e-mail (see attached), we are focusing on 
commercial banks to improve their relationship profitability to incent them 
to be more committed with immediate funding for acquisitions.  We have 
reviewed this approach with Jeff McMahon's group (through Charles Delacey) 
and they concur.  I am not aware of the "chits" that may be owed Lehman (or 
other I-banks) but our thought was if our last deal cleaned the slate we 
would concentrate on our commercial bank relationship strategy.  Certainly 
Lehman would have an opportunity to play in future deals, especially equity.

I will be travelling Thursday and Friday so please leave word with John Jesse 
(402)398-7843 if this list is acceptable.  If you would like to discuss 
please leave me a message and I will call you from NY.

Subject: NBP Financing RFP's

Just to give you a "heads-up" we are preparing a request for proposal for 
lead managers on a NBP debt financing.  The financing plan is for a $150 
million term debt facility to payoff existing MLP bank debt and a $150 
million bank revolver (which would be undrawn) to provide greater financial 
flexibility in the future.  Although we haven't determined the list of 
bidders a key objective is to provide additional fee income to those banks 
willing to commit their balance sheets when needed (i.e. commercial banks) to 
strengthen our position for future acquisition financing.  We will send you a 
copy of the RFP and a list of recommended bidders mid next week.  We would 
anticipate sending this out late next week.

Brian, I am attempting to outline some of the topics we have discussed in 
order that the points can be reviewed by our respective counsel and 
management.  Upon agreement, this Outline (with the exception of #2) could 
then serve as a guide for the attorneys to incorporate into the Purchase & 
Sale Agreement.  Brian, please consider this a draft reflecting my ideas, as 
I am in the process of seeking comments from Stan Horton and the NPNG 
officers.

1.  NEWCO, an LLC, should be owned 100% by NBILP, an affiliate of the 
Northern Border MLP.  (Question for Janet - should NEWCO be the existing NBP 
Energy Pipelines LLC ?

2.  We would agree on the following personnel points: (i) ENA employees who 
transfer from ENA  are not  to be disadvantaged from their present 
compensation and benefits package. (ii)  An incentive structure at the NEWCO 
level needs to be formed as a part of the compensation package.  This 
incentive should recognize the performance of (a) NBP  LP, (b) NEWCO's bottom 
line contribution to the MLP and (c) the growth of assets being managed by 
NEWCO.   Our experience  with personnel dedicated  to MLP businesses leads us 
to recommend that the Denver employees who transfer become employees of 
Northern Plains Natural Gas Company (NPNG),  thus ensuring that the Enron 
compensation package (specifically stock options and bonus program)  covers 
the ENA employees without interruption.   Our proposal is that Brian Bierbach 
would head the Rocky Mountain Division of NPNG, as a Vice President of 
Northern Plains.  In addition, Brian would serve as an officer of NEWCO.  
Finally, Brian would report to the President of NPNG and to the CEO of NBP 
LP.    

3.   Business focus/charter of NEWCO.   The scope of permissible investments 
for publicly traded partnerships is set forth at Section 7704 (d) of the 
Internal Revenue Code.  Under Section 7704(d), qualifying income includes 
income and gains derived from the exploration, development, mining, 
production, processing, refining, transportation (including pipelines 
transporting gas, oil or products thereof), or the marketing of any mineral 
or natural resource (including fertilizer, geothermal energy, and timber. It 
also includes interest, dividends, real property rents and gain from the sale 
of real property, as well as a gain from the sale of a capital asset held for 
the production of other qualifying income. Section 7704 (d) goes on to define 
"mineral or natural resource" to mean any product of a character with respect 
to which a deduction for depletion is allowable under Section 611."

During its 7 year history NBP LP has attempted to avoid exposure to commodity 
risk inherent in trading the natural resources that it has transported.   NBP 
wishes to continue this policy and is not interested in assuming such 
exposure in any degree which might be considered material to our financial 
reporting.  Over the years  a limited body of precedent (IRS Rulings) has 
grown up, clarifying what constitutes "qualifying income" for an MLP.   For 
example, investment in assets used to generate electricity is not permitted 
for an MLP, although a pipeline to deliver natural gas to such generating 
assets could qualify. Furthermore, NBP is not restricted to investments in 
the USA, and does actively pursue investments in Canada.  NBP believes that 
the restrictions on qualifying investments for an MLP further decreases the 
potential for conflict with ENA's much broader objectives.

4. Area of Mutual Interest between ENA and NEWCO.   NBP proposes that the 
state of Wyoming and the Eastern one half of the state of Montana be defined 
as an area of mutual interest (AMI) in which NEWCO will have the first right 
to invest in ENA project assets producing "qualifying income" .   Within such 
defined AMI, ENA would have the first right to participate in the commodity 
and trading opportunities of such projects.  Outside the defined AMI,  
(everywhere else in North America) ENA and NEWCO will work together under the 
Cooperative Strategy described in the next paragraph, but without first 
rights of participation for either party.

5. Cooperative Strategy.    NBP believes that a strong and dynamic 
partnership can be created by combining ENA's expertise in commodity trading, 
use of financial derivatives and creative financial structures,  together 
with NBP's financing capabilities and its investment objective of owning an 
infrastructure of hard energy assets which produce qualifying  MLP income.   
To that end we should agree to cooperate in the pursuit of project 
investments meeting the objectives of ENA and NBP throughout the North 
American continent.

Peggy:

Considering where we are in the divestiture process, I don't think it is the 
right time to have PGE contract for and administer the Health and Welfare 
Benefits noted in your memo dated 04/20/01.  In addition, it is likely that a 
potential buyer would want PGE to come under its own Health and Welfare 
Benefits.  Switching now could entail having PGE employees being under three 
Plans in a relatively short period of time.

Stan,
It was a pleasure to read your Innovation communication and hear that you 
welcome innovative ideas to be shared directly with you.  The creative and 
innovative environment shared with my fellow employees in GPG is one of the 
primary reasons I enjoy working at Enron.  

The experience of working for cutting edge thinkers like Jane Wilson and 
Steve Barth in EES and Dave Schafer, Mike McGowan and John Goodpasture in GPG 
has been very rewarding because these individuals gave me responsibility 
along with the room to create and innovate and then implement the ideas 
generated.

Currently, in Business Consulting, Mike McGowan, has given me the opportunity 
to be supported by our Associate, Kristen Hand, from the Analyst/Associate 
Program, which has seeded creativity and innovation even further.

In response to your request for ideas, I consider your invitation to share 
ideas with you to be more than just an invitation.  I consider it to be a 
challenge by you to the employees to find innovative ideas to send to you.   
Since I pride myself on being one of the innovators in GPG, I would not want 
you to think that a lack of ideas coming your way is any indication of a lack 
of innovative thinking on the 41st floor or elsewhere in GPG.  

A suggestion:  It might be helpful if you gave employees an area of interest 
that you would like to hear creative ideas for.  For instance, ideas could 
possibly be sent to you for:
outside-of-the-box thinking on new business opportunities
better ways of getting ideas to percolate within the organization
improvements to the GPG Intranet site
how to make GPG the best place to work within Enron
subjects that the employees would like to hear more information about
to name just a few.

Observation:  Innovation is a little like popcorn popping.  Only a few will 
kernels will pop until the conditions are just right.  It seems as though, 
some kernels have to start popping in order to encourage the others to pop.

Several months ago, eThink brought a trainer in for several 2 hour sessions 
that were not well attended by GPG employees and were not offered in Omaha.  
At this training we learned that creative thinking is enhanced when both 
sides of the brain are used, so we ate "Think" energy bars, wore tube socks 
(studies show that more ideas come when you are wearing tube socks) and had 
lots of colorful and fun items on the tables.  What if GPG held innovation 
breaks occasionally with energy bars, colored markers, chart paper, colorful 
and fun items, etc.. to generate any and all thoughts on a particular 
subject?  These sessions would accomplish multiple goals of teaching about 
how to use tools to tap into the creative side of one's thinking, lightening 
up the work environment to let innovative ideas begin to flow and generating 
many ideas on the subject of your choice.

Effective immediately, John Millar will be officing with some of Stan 
Horton's Enron GPG staff to explore the opportunity
for EOTT to generate additional earnings via leasing our pipeline ROW for 
fiber optic cable.  Stan's group has
generated very substantial earnings through this initiative and we are 
excited about the possibilities for EOTT.
John will continue to be an employee of EOTT while he focuses on this project.
We will keep you posted on future developments.

This is Wiley's report on his meeting with the Cabinet aides, if you want to 
read.  The meetings all went very well.  The hearing is on the 22nd, I 
believe.

Subject: RE:Briefings of Cabinet Aides  

Anne Longman and I briefed Cabinet Aides for the Governor, Secretary of 
State, Commissioner of Education, and Insurance Commissioner today.  Anne's 
associate, David Ramba, joined us for i ntroductions to the Governor's Aide 
and to the Secretary of State's Aide.  We covered the materials and had good 
discussions in every case.  The Governor's Aide was very encouraging and 
interested in the project.  He shared with us that the aides had been 
discussing the competing "want-a-be pipeline" projects and he believed that 
they would not be built due to the lack of economic feasibility.  Every one 
of the aides comprehended that this is a real project on the way to being 
built in a timely manner.  The Education Commissioner's Aide asked the only 
question that we were unable to answer.  "How many jobs will be lost in 
Florida due to the displacement of the fuel oil transportation?"  Having 
asked the question, she said she did not really have a problem with it .  I 
believe we should have the answer in case it comes up again.

One very beneficial event which took place yesterday  was the visit by every 
aide we briefed today to the Hines Plant of Florida Power Corp.  They had a 
much better understanding of  a combined cycle plant.
 
In our last briefing of the Insurance Commissioner's Aide, he requested that 
we provide the Commissioner with an aerial view of the West Leg extension if 
we could do so without going to a lot of expense.  He says the Commissioner 
is real "aerial/map" person.  This probably  relates in some way to his ride, 
while he was a Congressman, on the Space Shuttle.  If we have access to an 
aerial taken from high altitude (from a satelite) that we can mark the route 
upon, then we can probably benefit from this particular aerial/map interest.

Tomorrow  we plan to complete the final three  briefings in the afternoon.

Thanks for all of your efforts on Phase IV and particularly for bringing Anne 
and I up to speed.  

Please let us know by contacting Anne's office tomorrow if you have any 
questions of comments.

The Gas NOPR/NOI is not on the agenda for the upcoming FERC meeting.  That's 
good news from the standpoint that it gives us time to present a proposal on 
pricing ROFR.

I also thought that you would be interested to know that Gay Friedmann and 
Lorraine Cross are meeting next week with McLane Layton (the potential FERC 
replacement).  So while Jerry Halvorsen reports that INGAA will likely take 
no position, it sounds like INGAA staffers are moving forward at meeting the 
candidates.  That makes me feel more comfortable moving forward with out 
Enron call with Ms. Layton.   (FYI - Cynthia also reports that El Paso 
actively backed Ms. Layton when her name surfaced during a prior FERC 
vacancy).

Subject: EOTT - new analyst at Merrill Lynch

FYI-
I spoke with Andrew Fairbanks, the Merrill Lynch analyst that is going to 
start covering EOTT.  He will take over coverage of several MLPs including 
Plains, Teppco, and Lakehead.  The transition will probably happen sometime 
in March.

I suggested he visit the EOTT offices to meet management.  He will probably 
take me up on the offer sometime in early March.

I am sending him historical information on EOTT, as well as the presentation 
I prepared for A.G. Edwards.

Scott

Dear Board Task Force:

Attached is the white paper, revised with process information and three pages
on public-private partnerships as an intro.  The attachment totals 25 pages
in length.  It is a good document for introducing someone to GISB.  The first
three pages on public private partnerships highlights our credibility with
the FERC.  The executive summary and conclusion in the next part of the
report can be read separately -- for those who don't want to read the whole
report.

Guys,

Regarding Tim's fax dealing with Bush's position on American Indians--I have 
been working with Ken Lay and Mark Palmer  since about last June trying to  
help Bush's staff develop an American Indian policy platform.  Frankly, 
they've been somewhat of a reluctant audience, but hey, since when has that 
ever diminished my enthusiasm? 

 I'll keep you apprised of the substance of any progress.

Thanks!

--Christie.

I received word back from 4 of the 5 parties in response to my earlier notes 
(both voice mails and e-mails) on:
rehearing process and compliance filing
agenda for the 29th
native load
participation and valuation

Here is the download --

Rehearing Process and Compliance Filing -- They recognized that there were 
differences; however, they felt that the rehearing process and JV 
formation/process provided avenues to make the needed changes.  The major 
changes in the compliance filing were removal of approval rights, such as 1) 
acquisition or encumbrance of a transmission asset and 2) sale or issuance of 
membership interests.  Craig Baker indicated he would send a copy of the 
compliance filing tomorrow.  He also indicated that they planned to file by 
late today or tomorrow.

Agenda for the 29th -- The agenda seems to be in place; however, they did 
indicate that they would only be able to address the wires to wires synergy 
discussion in part.  They indicated that they would be able to address the 
areas where savings or additional revenue would be generated but may not be 
in a position to specify the financial impact (i.e., ebitda and market value 
impact).  They also indicated that Andersen has all of the individual Company 
numbers but not sure when the consolidated top financials will be available.  
Craig Baker committed to provide an update by tomorrow morning.  I have a 
call into Larry Oliva from Andersen as well.  

Native Load -- The difference between our respective positions (per Craig 
Baker) supports my earlier description.  Craig indicated that the Native Load 
and Wholesale Network Customers are advantaged (as compared to the Firm 
Point-to-Point Wholesale Customer) as a result of the filed Network 
Agreement.  This allows the Network Customers to increase capacity as load 
grows (potentially usurping the rollover right of a Firm Point-to-Point 
Wholesale Customer).  The Alliance feels this will be a point of contention 
between the State PUC's and FERC, and, they did not want to be placed in the 
middle. 

Participation and Valuation --  
AEP -- Craig Baker indicated that Henry Fayne will be there
1st -- Stan Szwed indicated he is confirming their CFO's attendance.  He will 
get back with me by Monday.
Detroit Edison -- Joe Welch is confirming the attendance of their lead M&A 
representative and will get back with me by Monday (He also applauds our 
attempts to move this forward)
Consumers -- Chuck Waits is discussing the resource issue with Chris Helms 
(President and COO) .    He also committed to get back with me by Monday.
Virginia Power -- no word

Please call Randy or me if you have any questions.  Thanks, Ron.

Jeff:  I have followed up with other DOE politicals who advised they will 
meet this Thursday with Bob Gee to finalize and approve his speech to NARUC 
on Monday, July 24th.  It is looking positive that he may be positioned to 
make the announcement Monday.  However, DOE will likely need to revisit some 
folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some 
of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on 
business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet  like 
APX, Altra, and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.)  
Too, I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability 
Panel as a model since their timeline was slow, but rather suggest the TVA 
Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only 
four meetings.  I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary 
Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week.  I have also 
discussed this with John Anderson of ELCON who is supportive.

Subject: Mtg w/Bob Gee

Cynthia and I met with Bob Gee regarding a potential role for DOE in creating 
a national standards board.  Bob appeared comfortable with establishing a 
"Blue Ribbon" panel, similar to the reliability panel, to address this 
issue.  In fact, Bob suggested that the reliability panel, which includes a 
balance of key stakeholders, could be re-tasked with this issue.

We recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure 
(governance, segments, executive committees) and scope of the organization 
(retail, wholesale, gas, electric).  Bob plans to follow-up with us next week.

issues related to organizational structure, governance, etc. of the joint

"Alliance" compliance filing planned for the end of this week.  I want to 
make sure that  we are all working under the same assumptions as it applies 
to the JV.  Could you please call me so we could discuss before the formal 
filing.  In addition, I would like to suggest a short discussion on the 
procedure you plan on following during the rehearing and compliance filing 
steps.  

Furthermore, I want to confirm the agenda items for the next meeting (see 
below).

Agenda for the 29th is as follows (and in order of appearance):

on earnings and market value)

Alliance presents synergy, growth and financial opportunities (including 
impact on earnings and market value)

Outline Joint Venture Structural Form.  We would like to discuss in detail 
and will provide a handout at the meeting.  The discussion will include:
type and timing of contribution (stock or asset)
governance
type of ownership (passive and active)
Valuation (this will require participation from Financial or Corporate 
Development areas of your respective organizations)
Agree on Process
Agree on Method
Timing

Participants from Enron will be --

Stan Horton (Chairman & CEO of GPG)
Mark Metts (Exec. VP Enron Corp. -- Corporate Development)

We will want to know who will participate on each entities behalf as well.  
Last, when can we expect the top financials for the Alliance?  You had 
indicated this would be forthcoming on or before Feb. 21.

Thanks, Ron.

Dear Industry Participant:

At the industry meeting held at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on
April 26, the participants supported another round of industry comments to
conclude on May 22.  The comments to be submitted electronically to the GISB
office (gisb@aol.com) should address:
    ? organizing principles that should be followed as its structure is
defined,
    ? definition of the organization(s),
    ? organizational structure including governance bodies,
    ? voting including a balanced voting mechanism, and
    ? definition of industry segments.

These comments will be posted on the GISB home page for public access and
use, and they will also be submitted to the GISB Board of Directors along
with comments that have previously been submitted and posted regarding the
creation of a new standards organization.

We appreciate the effort of the industry participants in considering whether
a national standards organization is needed, and if so, a definition of its
scope, organizational structure and organizing principles.  We look forward
to receiving additional comments, which will be promptly posted on our web
site for public access and use.

Should you need further information, do not hesitate to visit our web site
(www.gisb.org) or call our office (713-356-0060).  Transcripts of the
meetings (February 14, April 17, and April 26) are available from Ms.

Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors 
meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect 
EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent 
that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.

Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the 
Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.

Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the 
Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the 
outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on 
EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the 
outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued 
service.

Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you 
would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on 
last year's "annual meeting" agenda.

Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

Dear officers,

    We have been approached by Hines, our building landlord, asking us if we
would consider moving.  Cinergy -- the only other tenant on our floor, have
asked for our space.  Our lease runs through to April 2002, for 2455 square
feet of space.  Hines noted that all moving expenses (upwards of $50,000)
would be covered.  In addition, they indicated our lease might be extended to
the end of 2004 at our current rate of $6.00 base per square foot and $8.50
add on for utilities and maintenance per square foot, for a total of $14.50
per square foot.  This is an advantageous rate as it was negotiated prior to
downtown becoming so populated.  We confirmed with commercial real estate
agents that average rates for downtown space "A Buildings" now are
considerably higher, in the neighborhood of $22 to $30 per square foot and
more if we were located in the Galleria area.  Our building is considered an
"A Building."

    There is other space in the building that is better laid out, and would
accommodate expansion, if needed.  We are still in the discussion stages --
but it looks like a financially favorable arrangement if everything can be
worked out.  We would be able to move over a weekend, have little or no
disruption of service, maintain the same phone numbers, still be in the same
building -- have more possibilities for expansion if needed, and maintain the
same low rate for a longer period of time.  The space they have offered is
2500 square feet but at our current monthly rental rates.

    We should be able to sublease the space with little difficulty, in the
event a new organization comes into being and our location and office is not
appropriate for the new organization.  Looks like lots of advantages and very
few risks.

    If we stay where we are, our lease runs out in April 2002 in which event
we will probably be required to move and we will spend upwards of $50,000 to
make such a move and be faced with higher per square foot rental costs.
Meanwhile, Cinergy is planning to reconstruct our floor and our office will
be in the middle of construction activity for some time.

    The conversations are in the early stages, and I'll keep you informed as
they go. Let me know if you have any concerns with  this approach.

Best Regards,  Rae

Please find attached a second draft of the strawman.  It reflects one board,
one EC both with fixed sub-segments.  It establishes three BPS's to keep the
focus on Gas with a gas wholesale BPS, as well as creates a wholesale
electric BPS.  The idea being to keep the expertises focussed.  It also
provides for a combined retail BPS.  There are detailed procedures for
voting and maintaining the legitimate representation of gas.  There are
protections for standards setting and governance changes which are
respectively, "25, 2, and 1" (EC) as well as 19, 2, and 1 (Board).  I look
forward to your comments.

Susan, Thanks to you and Walt and all others who worked on this.  Having a 
check of that magnitude come to us by June certainly 
exceeded my expectations.  And this did not just happen...you folks did an 
excellent job of making it happen.

Now Walt, if you can just assure us that in Mr. Todoroff's situation that 
justice will be served!

Thanks again.

		 Subject: Insurance Recovery on Todoroff Matter

Susan, I spoke this morning with Nancy Manderson (outside counsel for our 
crime policy insurer).  She has accepted my changes to the Assignment and 
Release, and she will be forwarding an original of the Assignment and Release 
to EOTT for execution.  She said we will have our check for $2,503,000.00 
next week!  The check will be delivered to Phillip Bair with our insurance 
broker.

We also had a long conversation about the insurer's claim against Gas 
Producers.  I shared with Nancy some of the research we have done on the 
conversion claim against Gas Producers.  I assured her that EOTT would fully 
cooperate if the insurer did pursue the claim against Gas Producers.  I 
gathered from her comments, however, that the insurer is concerned that Gas 
Producers may not have sufficient assets to satisfy anything but a small 
judgment.  I do not know whether the insurer has actually conducted a 
"financial investigation" of Gas Producers.

Dear Board Task Force Member,

At the conclusion of our meeting on February 14, Mr. Templeton noted that
participants could forward additional comments including their reactions to

Attached below is a copy of EPA's legislative principles for phasing out MTBE 
use.   These principles have been criticized by Members of Congress -- even 
oxygenate bill sponsor Brian Bilbray -- as being very vague and lacking any 
helpful information whatsoever.   At the House Commerce Committee hearing a 
few weeks ago, EPA Assistant Administrator Perciasepe was blasted for not 
having submitted anything in detail that would help Congress solve the 
complex RFG/MTBE issue.  These empty prinicples will not likely help EPA in 
moving forward with their regulatory plans.

*******

LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES,
PRESERVING CLEAN AIR BENEFITS, AND PROMOTING RENEWABLE FUELS

The Federal Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) established in the Clean Air 
Act Amendments of 1990 has provided substantial reductions in the emissions 
of a number of air pollutants from motor vehicles, most notably volatile 
organic compounds and nitrogen oxides (precursors of ozone), carbon monoxide, 
and air toxics (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and others).  In most cases these 
reductions have exceeded those required by law.

However, the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether ("MTBE") in our nation's fuel 
supply has created a significant and unacceptable risk to drinking water and 
ground water resources.  As a result of these concerns, last year EPA 
commissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel on MTBE and Oxygenates in Gasoline (the 
"Panel").  On July 27, 1999 the Panel issued recommendations on ways to 
maintain air quality while protecting water quality from the risks associated
with MTBE.  Significantly, the Panel called for a substantial reduction in 
the use of MTBE as well as action by Congress to remove the current 2% 
oxygenate requirement from the Clean Air Act.  EPA endorsed the Panel's 
recommendations and committed to work with Congress to make targeted 
amendments to the Clean Air Act.

In the months since the Panel issued its recommendations, detections of MTBE 
in water supplies have grown and Congress has not yet acted to address this 
issue.  It is of increasing importance to enact legislation that addresses 
this problem in an environmentally sound and cost-effective way. Such 
legislation should provide authority to phase out MTBE while avoiding 
gasoline supply shortages and ensuring price stability.

The following legislative principles, taken together as a single package, are 
designed to maintain air quality and enhance water quality protection while 
preserving the significant role of renewable fuels, most importantly 
ethanol.  In addition, it is the Administration's intention that the 
resulting legislation provide sufficient flexibility with respect to both 
time and range of technological choices so as to allow for continued adequate 
supplies of gasoline at reasonable prices for consumers.

Recommendation #1: Amend the Clean Air Act to provide the authority to 
significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE.

The rising number of MTBE detections in ground and surface water in some 
areas of the nation have increased the urgency for preventing further MTBE 
contamination.  In some cases, communities have been forced to abandon their 
drinking water supply.  To effectively address this growing problem, the 
Administration recommends that Congress amend the Clean Air Act to provide 
the authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE. 


Recommendation #2: As MTBE use is reduced or eliminated, ensure that air 
quality gains are not diminished.

The clean burning Reformulated Gasoline Program has helped bring clean air to 
cities across the nation.  In many cases, Americans have enjoyed air quality 
improvements that have exceeded expectations.  The Administration recommends 
that as Congress significantly reduces or eliminates MTBE, it institute 
measures that maintain our air quality gains.

Recommendation #3: Replace the existing oxygen requirement contained in the 
Clean Air Act with a renewable fuel standard for all gasoline.

Reducing or eliminating MTBE in no way diminishes the continued need for 
other oxygenates, such as ethanol, to control mobile source emissions.  In 
addition, a significant role for renewable fuels is important to our nation's 
energy supply (see, EO 13134 in which President Clinton sets a goal of 
tripling the use of renewable bio-energy by 2010).  Thus, the Administration 
recommends that Congress replace the 2% oxygenate requirement in the Clean 
Air Act with a renewable fuel annual average content for all gasoline at a 
level that maintains the current level of renewable fuel (1.2% of the 
gasoline supply) and allows for sustained growth over the next decade.

Congressional action on these recommendations is essential if we are to 
continue to achieve the clean air public health benefits of cleaner burning 
gasoline while avoiding unacceptable risks to our nation's water supplies.  
The Administration urges Congress to address this request for legislation as 
quickly as possible. We remain committed to working with Congress to provide 
a targeted legislative solution to this matter.

Stan,

Congratulations on your new appointment to Enron wind.  I am forwarding
this email as it may be of some use in your new role.  Mitsui is a Japanese
holding company that I have had very light ongoing discussions on equity
investments they were looking for in power in North America as part of my
old role in origination in Enron North America.  I have met Mr. Tamura only
once so it may make sense, if you have any interest, to contact him
directly.  In any case if you have no interest in starting a dialogue
please let me know so that I can get back to Mr. Tamura and let him know.

Thanks,
Rodney Malcolm

Dear Mr. Malcolm

I hope you could remember me.  I visited you with my colleague in November
1999 to discuss possible collaboration between Enron and Mitsui.  While we
could not identify any project which we can jointly proceed with, the
discussion we had with you at that time was very useful for us.

The reason for me to writing this now is that I heard from some people that
Enron is now considering sale of Enron's wind power assets (Enron Wind).
We
think that the Wind power will be more popular in Japan as well and we have
an interest in Enron Wind.  If you have any idea about status of Enron's
this effort, it would be very helpful if you could share some idea with me,
like price level Enron is thinking of and whether or not any actual
negotiation is going on, etc.

I will be travelling most of next two weeks and it would be very convenient
if you could e-mail me your response.

Regards,
Ichiro Tamura, Mitsui USA

Susan, I spoke this morning with Nancy Manderson (outside counsel for our 
crime policy insurer).  She has accepted my changes to the Assignment and 
Release, and she will be forwarding an original of the Assignment and Release 
to EOTT for execution.  She said we will have our check for $2,503,000.00 
next week!  The check will be delivered to Phillip Bair with our insurance 
broker.

We also had a long conversation about the insurer's claim against Gas 
Producers.  I shared with Nancy some of the research we have done on the 
conversion claim against Gas Producers.  I assured her that EOTT would fully 
cooperate if the insurer did pursue the claim against Gas Producers.  I 
gathered from her comments, however, that the insurer is concerned that Gas 
Producers may not have sufficient assets to satisfy anything but a small 
judgment.  I do not know whether the insurer has actually conducted a 
"financial investigation" of Gas Producers.

As suspected, the Senate Environment Committee's scheduled markup of MTBE 
legislation will not take place on Wednesday, July 26. 

The next possible Committee markup dates include:  September 7, 2000, or more 
likely, some time during the week of September 11, 2000.

We will be working during the month of August to refine our proposed 
amendments, and to work with Senate staff and other stakeholder groups 
(refiners, environmentalists) to gain support for our positions.

I will keep you posted as developments occur.

Sounds good.  Mike Moran has the numbers for our Montana lawyers and I will 
assist him any way I can.  The big question is whether Enron, as a whole, 
would be willing to give up any protection they might still have under the 
old  InterNorth policies.  SWD

Here is the initial feedback from the Montana lawyers.  Looks like Lloyds is 
more interested settling with EOTT as part of a global buy out of all old 
InterNorth policies. I wouldn't place any stock whatsoever in the comment 
Lloyds' representative made about Studdert.  He has been very helpful and 
highly professional in all matters pertaining to this case.  EOTT and Enron 
might be able to negotiate some sort of settlement as part of a global buy 
out, but I don't know if Enron would even consider this.  Studdert might have 
the best feel for this.  Separately, the defendant group will get back to us 
on any offer they might be willing to make to settle just the Montana case, 
but it appears that their real interest would be in a "global" deal.  Any 
comments?  SWD

I spoke with Jim McAndrews late this afternoon.  I told him EOTT was 
interested in following up on the possibility of settling the case, which he 
left open after the trial.

He said that, after trial, London concluded they wanted to, in essence, buy 
out all of Enron Corp's coverage and were not interested in settling the case 
on its own.  They corresponded with Jim Studdert a few times during the 
winter, but Jim responded in a way that John said was rude.

If we are interested in talking about a buy-out, London would be interested.  
I told him that would be very difficult for EOTT to arrange, as it is not the 
sole insured.  I asked if buying out just EOTT's coverage was a possibility.  
He pointed out that there is a strong connection between the two (Enron's 
listing in Martindell lists EOTT's attorneys, he claims) and thinks it could 
be done as one package.  In any event, London really wants to deal with all 
the coverage under the Internorth policies.

I told him I had heard about the buy-out campaign elsewhere and had forwarded 
material to Studdert on that issue.  I need to follow-up with Studdert and 
Duffy to figure out where Enron/EOTT is on this issue now.

I asked what number his people would be willing to pay just to settle the 
Ashland claim, in the likely event that there could be no buy-out.  He said 
he would need to talk with London about that.  I suspect it will be quite 
small.

We agreed that we would each speak with our people and get back in touch 
early next week.

I left a voice mail with Steve to this regard, but I'm copying him as well 
for his information.

Dave, as I described in my voice mail I am sending you by Federal Express, a 
proposal by the ENA (Denver) employees (who NBP hopes to recruit) covering 
their compensation after they come over to manage the Wyoming assets being 
acquired in Project 20/20 from ENA.  Specifically, I believe our mutual 
objective is to see that the ENA employees who are about to become GPG 
employees are compensated in a similar manner and at the same levels as they 
were when they were employees of ENA.    Could you use your HR contacts at 
ENA to confirm that this proposal (see page 4 of the FEDEX package) is how 
they were compensated at ENA ?  Any other advice you can give us on this 
question will be appreciated. We are being asked to negotiate these terms up 
front as an inducement to get the ENA folks to jump on the GPG bandwagon.  
This negotiation will be going strong next week, so your help will be needed 
soon.   Please give me a call as I am sure you will have questions on this.

As a follow up to today's Capital Project review meeting, attached below are 
the lists of all EOTT vehicles for your review.  We discussed leasing the 
vehicles in the 2000 Maintenance Budget, and also considering a lease of 
vehicles purchased in prior years.  

As requested, these lists cover every vehicle of every description owned or 
leased by EOTT, including trailers and maintenance equipment.  The vehicles 
being replaced by new 2000 vehicles are highlighted in the "July 13 Total 
Equip List" spreadsheet.  Vehicles that may be replaced by Employee Owned 
Vehicles are listed in the "2000 Values for EOV Vehicles" spreadsheet.  

If this is too confusing, please let me or David Holland help with any 
questions you have.

Thanks,
Cutty

In respone to your request for vehicle list, I have attahced the following:

Total Tractors and Trailers (July 13 Crude Tractors & Trailers.xls) - This 
file has all crude tractors, crude bobtails, crude trailers/pups, and NGL 
tractors and trailers included.

Total Other Vehicle List (July 13 Total Equip List.xls) - This file has all 
other assets that have tires (cars, pickups, backhoes, forklifts, utility 
trailers, pipeline maintenance equipment)  Vehicles highlighted in red are 
units ordered through PHH that have been received or shipped.

List of Vehicles/Personnel proposed to go to EOV (2000 Values for EOV 
Vehicles.xls) - This list contains the personnel and vehicles we proposed to 
transition to the EOV Plan (Runzheimer).  Every vehicle on this spreadsheet 
is included in the July 13 Total Equip List.xls.  We have the potential to 
reduce EOTT owned vehicles by this amount if all go to Runzheimer.

New vehicles ordered through PHH as part of partnership with Enron and the 
Fleet Council (2000 EOTT New Veh Order Status 060100.xls).  This has all of 
the light utility vehicles we ordered through Enron for delivery in 2000.

FYI....we have added Dan Dienstbier to the Northern Border Partners' Audit 
Committee.

SEC rules dictated that we add another member, and Dan Whitty and Gerald 
Smith wanted someone with an operations background.

Dan also serves on Dynegy's Board, but neither Bill Cordes (President of 
Northern Border) nor I saw a conflict.

INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS :
* We are downgrading EOTT Energy Partners to 2-Outperform from 1-Buy based
in
  part on the reduced prospects for near-term acquisitions.  We are also
  reducing our price target from $17 to $16, which is based on a cash
  distribution of $1.90 and a yield of 13.4%.
* We are concerned about the lack of near-term acquisition prospects for
  EOTT, and the subsequent impact this will have on cash distribution
  coverage levels.  EOTT's coverage level of total units is estimated at 75%

  for 2000 and 84% for 2001.
* EOTT's unit price is already up 9.1% through 2Q00 versus the S&P 500 which

  is down 1.0% in the same period.  We believe further unit appreciation
will
  likely be inhibited until coverage levels improve.
WE ARE DOWNGRADING EOTT ENERGY PARTNERS TO 2-OUTPERFORM FROM 1-BUYBASED IN
PART ON THE REDUCED PROSPECTS FOR NEAR-TERM ACQUISITIONS.  We are also
reducing our price target to $16 from $17, which is based on a cash
distribution of $1.90 and a yield of 13.4%.  We are maintaining our earnings

estimates for EOTT at $0.50 for 2000 and $0.64 for 2001.

WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF NEAR-TERM ACQUISITION PROSPECTS FOR EOTT
AND THE SUBSEQUENT IMPACT THIS HAS ON IMPROVING THE CASH DISTRIBUTION
COVERAGE LEVELS.
We estimate that the total unit coverage level will be 75% in 2000,
increasing to 84% in 2001, assuming a cash distribution of $1.90 per unit.
EOTT will need to boost its distributable cash level by approximately $14
million in order to reach the 100% coverage level for all units in 2000.
Without making an acquisition, it is unlikely that EOTT will reach this
coverage level before 2002.  Furthermore, although an acquisition would be
accretive in the long run, it would likely be dilutive to earnings and cash
in
the near-term.  In the meantime, EOTT has coverage support from Enron
through
2001.

UNIT PRICE APPRECIATION IS LIKELY TO BE INHIBITED UNTIL COVERAGE LEVELS
IMPROVE FURTHER
EOTTs unit price has appreciated 9.1% through the end of 2Q00, as compared
to
the S&P 500, which is down 1.0% during the same time period.  Including the
cash distributions, EOTTs return has been close to 16% so far this year.

Thanks for the present-I really appreciate your thoughtfulness.  Am going to
have it framed and put up some place in the house.  Heard the great news
about Debbie and you-my congratulations.  As we both know kids make this a
special place-wish you all the happiness and joy in the world.

Hope all is well with you and that you had (are having) a great Holiday

Stan, Hugh & Bill:
Thanks for responding to me on this item.  While you have public email
addresses, concern was noted that Board members not be provided with
unsolicited emails simply because they are GISB Board members.  I will see
Miriam (AGA representative) next week respond to AGA that we are not in the
practice of providing Board member emails to other than Board members.  I
would be happy to forward his comments to the Board or have them posted for
public review -- as we have asked for comments on this subject.    Thanks, 
Rae

Stan -

I was wondering if you could provide my with feedback from the meeting
yesterday with representatives from EEI concerning the GISB scope issue.  I
attended the last meeting at FERC and left with the distinct impression that
there was little enthusiasm for GISB's proposal from the electric industry
representatives.  From William's perspective, we support the concept of
standards for the electric industry.  However, the mechanics and structure
should not dilute the sector balance we have achieved or drain our limited
resources in terms of people and funding.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ron

Attached is a copy of the press release describing the gas rule. 




I've heard through the grapevine that pipelines (not GPG) are already 
complaining that there
is  "nothing in it for pipelines."   I think we should be cautious about 
being so critical before we have even seen
the rule itself.  After all, many of the items in the rule are there at the 
pipelines request (seasonal & term-differentiated rates).    

I hope to be able to send out a summary on Friday.

Cindy,

Thank you for returning the message.  I did intend it for Bob
Stearns...sorry about the mix up!

As you have probably seen from our exchange of emails, Stan had asked me to
keep him apprised of any attractive investment opportunities I came across.
I took it from Stan's last message that he may or may not be interested in
Bob's fund, Sternhill, at this time but he would at least like to meet Bob
(hence the email to Bob that you received instead).  As you could see from
the email, I have asked Bob to contact Stan and to mention my name so that
you would have a reference for his call.  You should, therefore, expect Bob
to be calling (probably today) and please let Stan know that this was the
fellow I had mentioned in my message to him.

Thank you and happy holidays,

Dave Noble

Bob,

I should have checked farther down my email.  It looks like he is on the
fence but you ought to go ahead and contact him any way.  Stan runs all of
Enron's operations world wide and is a good friend.  You should be able to
reach him through Enron's main number (713-853-6161) and say that Dave
Noble
said to call when you reach him.

Stan,

Per your interest in putting some money to work, we will not be raising a
new fund until next fall at the earliest but I wanted to let you know about
another situation that might be of interest to you.  A good friend and
former client at Compaq, Bob Stearns, is putting together a fund to invest
in early stage technology deals.  Bob was SVP of technology and business
development at Compaq for several years but left when the crazies took over
(all of whom got fired, I might add).  Since I value my friendships too
much, I don't generally recommend people unless I really believe in who
they
are and what they are doing.  Bob is top notch, which is why I would feel
comfortable recommending him to you and would be very pleased to introduce
you to Bob because you are top notch as well.  I thought Bob had closed his
fund already but he said he was going to have a second closing in about 30
days so there is still time to get in if you are interested.  The typical
investment is in the $500k to $1m range although I know of one person who
got in for $250k. ( I introduced him to Frevert and Rice and they have both
invested.)  Bob is still in Houston and offices over in the Galleria area.

If you would like to talk to Bob, let me know when and where you can be
reached and I will forward your information to him.

Dave

Subject: Letters from Tampa Paper Regarding TECO conversion - Good and Bad

Couldn't remember if I had passed along copies of these letters to the editor 
from the Tampa Tribune.

Dec 20, 1999 - 07:33 PM 

             TECO is trying to do the right thing 
             JOHN RAMIL

             At Tampa Electric, we're trying to do the right thing. Our goal 
is a challenging one - to
             meet the needs of our customers and operate a financially sound 
business in an
             environmentally responsible way. 

             Even those with extreme viewpoints should agree that achieving a 
balance like this is
             never easy. But in our $1 billion agreement with the Florida 
Department of
             Environmental Protection, we believe we've found a way. 

             As with any major shift in thinking, the road to our 
environmental plan has been far
             from simple. Since early 1999, we have spent many, many hours in 
negotiation with
             two federal agencies, each, perhaps, with different objectives. 

             In our dialogue with EPA and the Department of Justice, we 
invested a great deal of
             time and energy trying to find common ground on which to develop 
a long-range
             environmental strategy for our company. 

             When this did not happen, the state of Florida stepped in, as 
was its right and duty as
             the agency with primary responsibility for implementation and 
enforcement of the
             environmental emission standards in question. 

             As an agency ready to act, DEP helped us craft an agreement that 
actually takes us
             further than any of our negotiations with the federal entities. 

             As a result, Tampa Electric has accomplished what we originally 
set out to do with
             the EPA - our nitrogen oxide emissions will drop by 85 percent 
by the year 2010 from
             1997 levels. Using 1994 as the starting point, the ultimate 
reductions in nitrogen oxide
             will exceed 90 percent. 

             These reductions are significant on their own, but even more so 
when you consider
             that Tampa Electric must simultaneously generate almost 40 
percent more electricity
             for our customers over the same time period. 

             But the federal government has said it is still not satisfied. 
They want penalties. In
             fact, that may be what this case is all about. 

             This is a dramatic departure from EPA's position stated on Nov. 
3, when they
             announced their suit against utilities around the country. Then, 
they said the purpose
             of the lawsuit was not to penalize, but to improve the air. 

             That's exactly what Tampa Electric is doing, with the direction 
of the DEP, in a way
             that balances the environment, our customers and our employees. 

             We're also a little confused as to why Hillsborough EPC chief 
Roger Stewart has
             criticized this landmark plan. Two years ago, when we announced 
a voluntary plan in
             concert with EPC to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by 10 
percent, Stewart was
             enthusiastic in his support. Now, a much higher 85 percent 
reduction draws his
             criticism. 

             Like any business, we have many stakeholders for whose interests 
we are concerned.
             The environment is a critical one, but it is still one of many. 

             We must also consider the effect of any major capital 
expenditures on our customers'
             rates, and we must make those expenditures in a way that is 
fiscally sound, so that
             we can continue to deliver reliable and economical electricity 
to meet our community's
             growing energy needs. 

             The $1 billion commitment we have pledged to environmental 
improvements
             represents a huge expenditure, particularly for a company with 
$3 billion in overall
             assets. 

             Yet we recognize the positive impact environmental improvements 
will have for our
             other stakeholders, including our customers in the Tampa Bay 
area. Toward this end,
             we are excited to have found a way to undertake the largest 
environmental cleanup
             effort Florida has seen in the last quarter-century. 

             We're proud of what we will accomplish on behalf of Florida's 
environment, while
             keeping our prices low and our service high. That, we believe, 
is the right thing to do. an 3, 2000 - 05:03 PM 

             Now for the Negative Side from January 3


             On Nov. 3 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency brought a 
lawsuit against Tampa
             Electric Co. for violations of the Clean Air Act. EPA claims 
TECO made illegal major
             changes to its Big Bend and Gannon power plants. The changes 
allowed TECO to
             extend the operating life of two of the nation's dirtiest power 
plants and to produce
             more electricity and more air pollution without necessary 
permits. On Dec. 8 the
             Florida Department of Environmental Protection filed and settled 
a state lawsuit
             against TECO involving those same actions. 

             Florida DEP Secretary David Struhs, in his Dec. 14 guest column 
(Commentary),
             makes fine-sounding arguments about why the TECO deal is good 
for Florida.
             However, the agreement DEP made doesn't match Struhs' 
description - only three of
             six Gannon units (built between 32 and 42 years ago) will close 
- units that were never
             built to run more than 25-30 years. The DEP agreement has many 
loopholes for
             TECO to slip through. Most important of the many conditions is 
that the Florida Public
             Service Commission must allow TECO to recover all its expenses 
for compliance from
             its customers. 

             Struhs defends allowing TECO to keep sulfur dioxide and nitrogen 
oxide emission
             credits; the former have a current value of about $200 per ton 
and can be sold to other
             utilities. The agreement allows both credits to be used by TECO 
in the future instead
             of requiring the utility to further reduce its pollution. And 
Struhs doesn't address the
             fact that the agreement protects TECO from having to comply with 
new air pollution
             standards for the next 10 years. 

             What is lost in Struhs' version of the deal is that a basic 
principle of government
             enforcement is to remove the reward the violator has reaped from 
its illegal action.
             TECO has overhauled obsolete plants, overpolluted and profited 
financially by its
             actions. The DEP deal doesn't come close to evening the score. 
Struhs makes much
             of ``punitive payments totaling $10 million'' going to Florida 
rather than Washington.
             But $2 million to study Tampa Bay pollution and $8 million to 
research technologies
             TECO might use are not punitive and are grossly inadequate 
compared with the
             benefit TECO received through its actions. And it's TECO 
customers, not those
             responsible for the violations, who will pay. 

             Legislation now before Congress would require electric utilities 
such as TECO to
             actually reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide 75 percent by 
2005, limit mercury by
             90 percent and reduce carbon dioxide emissions for the first 
time. Florida's
             congressional delegation, including representatives from the 
Tampa Bay region, needs
             to get serious about air pollution. Smog and fine particles are 
health threats that can
             no longer be ignored. Valuable natural resources such as Tampa 
Bay are at risk from
             air pollution that is nearby and is washed into the bay. 

             Air pollution is both a local and national problem. Secretary 
Struhs has demonstrated
             that we can't trust our state officials to protect our health 
from power plant pollution.
             We need real reductions sooner, rules or agreements with real 
teeth. Maybe it's time
             for a national solution. - GAIL KAMARAS Tallahassee

             TECO is the dirtiest plant in the nation. It has had 30 years to 
achieve compliance but
             attempts to strike another good ol' boy deal to get another 10 
years to pollute, but the
             feds object and try to protect locals. 

             The water management district (the term is not really 
descriptive of what it does) voted
             to put the largest desalination plant near Big Bend plant. Both 
members of the
             Hillsborough County Commission in the group voted against it, 
but the majority -
             representing water needs from Pasco and Pinellas County - don't 
want it in their areas
             because it may not leave room for more development. They voted 
to put it in our area
             with promises of no impact on the bay or canals. 

             A new wallboard plant is planned for a location near the Big 
Bend TECO plant and the
             desalination plant. Company officials also promise no pollution 
will leave the site. And
             oh, by the way, they will need lots of water! 

             Cargill announces that it needs to double the size of its gypsum 
stack in order to
             operate for the next 30 years. The company says there is no 
danger to the
             environment! 

             A consortium of phosphate companies has now announced that they 
want to put a
             liquid-sulfur plant near Big Bend. Again, promises of no odor or 
pollutants leaving the
             site. And again, they will need more water! 

             My questions are: 

             Who, if anyone, is studying the cumulative effects of all these 
actions? What plans
             are being made to ensure that there is no odor and that 
emissions do not leave the
             site? What protection is being included in the permits to ensure 
an immediate clean
             up response and shutdown of the facility in case of an accident? 

             I do not believe there is anyone doing these things from a 
whole-community
             perspective. The addition of the few jobs that will be created 
by this potentially
             disastrous collection of industries does not justify the 
potential damage to the bay,
             our community and our children's future. 

             Enough is enough! - RICHARD CLOY Apollo Beach 

             -- -- -- 

             Since 1998, Southwest Florida Water Management District has held 
monthly
             preapplication meetings on the Cone Ranch Dispersed Wells 
Project for Tampa Bay
             Water staff and consultants. 

             During these meetings, new information related to this hotly 
debated wellfield are
             discussed, and Tampa Bay Water gains a better understanding of 
what will be
             required to obtain a pumping permit for the Cone Ranch 
wellfield. 

             Citizens who organized in opposition to the Cone Ranch project 
were successful in
             obtaining the consultant-prepared preapplication meeting notes 
(approved by all
             attendees of the preapplication meetings). Unfortunately, the 
notes contain repetitive
             text, missing and incorrect meeting dates, apparent text 
deletions and poor definition
             of action items and responsibilities. In response to complaints 
about the lack of detail
             and accuracy, Tampa Bay Water responded that the reports were 
intended only ``to
             provide summaries of important discussion points'' and that the 
summaries were
             accurate. In effect, these ``accurate'' summaries prevented 
concerned citizens from
             sequentially reconstructing permitting developments at Cone 
Ranch and thereby
             limited public participation in the process. 

             On Oct. 12, Tampa Bay Water General Manager Jerry Maxwell agreed 
to allow two
             citizens of this donor community to attend Cone Ranch 
preapplication meetings as
             observers. However, despite the fact that ongoing studies 
continue to provide new
             project feasibility information, no preapplication meeting 
notices have been provided to
             these two citizens. In addition, Tampa Bay Water has denied our 
requests to
             videotape the preapplication meetings so that the proceedings 
can be shared with a
             growing multicounty-opposition base. 

             This unwillingness to share with the public information obtained 
at public expense is,
             unfortunately, consistent with many observations made by 
citizens and elected
             officials at the June meeting of the State Water Resources 
Committee. How long will
             Tampa Bay Water's board of directors require us to endure this 
level of disrespect and
             manipulation? - CINDY RYAN-BROWN Plant City

Mike Moran was able to get the securities "standstill" provision removed from 
the CA.  It has now been signed by us and returned for execution by Reliant.  

Kathy Campos will send to each of you in the morning, a letter we just 
received that describes the transaction process.  We are to review an 
Information Memorandum (to be provided ASAP) and respond with a non-binding 
indication of interest by 5:00 PM, March 15.  

The assets are being offered either as a total package, or in any subset(s), 
broken down as follows:
 Reliant Energy Gas Transmission and Mississippi River Transmission  (to be 
viewed together as a single asset)
 Reliant Energy Field Services 
 Reliant Energy Arkla
 Reliant Energy Minnegasco

Bidders can submit separate offers for different subsets of assets (i.e. one 
offer for the whole package, and different offers for separate assets).   

If we are selected to go on to the next phase, data room visits of 2 days 
each will begin on or about March 20.  REI will expect binding offers by 
April 20, with final execution of a definitive agreement in late April/early 
May.

I will disseminate the Information Memoranda as soon as received.

Scott for execution by Reliant.  

We look forward to receiving the Information Memoranda as soon as possible, 
so that we can comply with the time schedule for this transaction.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL - ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION


At approximately 11:30 a.m. today 2/17/00, there was a release of 
approximately 80 barrels of crude oil.  The crude oil entered an unnamed 
tributary near the Northwest corner of Caddo Lake.  The release was contained 
approximately 50 yards from the lake entrance.  The release occurred from a 
3" or 4" infield gathering line between a production facility and EOTT's 
Trees Station.  The release occurred approximately one mile east of Trees, 
LA.  The pipeline integrity was compromised by a tree limb.  It is believed 
that during the last freeze the tree limb fell on the gathering line.  This 
gathering line has not been run since before the freeze.  All appropriate 
agency notifications have been made.  The following EOTT personnel have been 
verbally notified: Cutty Cunningham; Mary Ellen Coombe; Molly Sample.  I 
suggest this be forwarded to Mike Burke, Cutty Cunnungham, Mary Ellen Coombe, 
Dana Gibbs and Robert Sandford

which occurred today in Louisiana.  In your summary, please tell me who else 
you think should be aware of this matter and I will forward your email

Andy Lang thinks Nisource management may be receptive to considering some 
joint participation with respect to the Reliant disposition.  Nisource has 
been in the data room for an early look at Reliant's two LDC's, but 
discussions broke down (possibly they had enough to worry about with 
Columbia?).  

Anyway, I have been thinking about an Enron/Nisource JV structure for the 
Reliant deal that would seemingly accomplish a number of objectives for both 
companies.  The valuations are preliminary and the structure could be 
adjusted a number of ways, but at least it is food for thought.

I discussed this briefly with Brian Redmond and Tim Detmering this 
afternoon.  They expressed interest in the unregulated storage (TPC/MHP) at 
Egan and Moss Bluff, which by the way, is NOT officially for sale, but are 
somewhat cool on the regulated storage that IS INCLUDED in the disposition.

Tim said that as a result of the Nisource/Columbia merger, he had intended to 
ask Mark Metts to cycle with you and Cliff Baxter to discuss how best to 
approach Nisource looking for ways to improve the ENA service contract with 
Columbia.  If such a meeting were to take place, perhaps there would be a 
natural opportunity to explore a JV concept.

 Attached is a description of the JV for your review and comment.

Dear Stan:

I greatly appreciated the opportunity to meet with you on Tuesday, and 
recognize
that the length of our meeting disrupted your schedule.  I thank you for your
frankness during our discussion.

I do want to reiterate that the business operations of GRI and IGT are
significantly different than those of a utility.  In addition, the evaluation
performed over the past six months has shown that the "mechanical" aspects of
the merger are straightforward.  I believe that basing a CEO selection
dominantly on these two criteria would subject the merged entity to an
unnecessary risk of failure.

Critical to the success of the Institute will be its ability to deliver
demonstrable value to its customers.  All of the critical building blocks will
exist at the combined Institute.  To capitalize on this opportunity, the 
leader
must be able to foster a creative, entrepreneurial environment in which
integrated teams work in concert, not in strife.

I encourage you to speak with members of both current and past organizations
that I have headed to gage the level of excitement and commitment that I have
been able to instill and my ability to create an atmosphere of mutual support
and respect from an initial environment of conflict.  My resume documents the
bottom line profit/loss impact that results from these effective teams.

During our discussion you asked if I could work effectively with Bill as the 
COO
of the "Institute."  Not only is the answer clearly yes, I emphasize that even
during last year when conflict between GRI and IGT became visible to DOE, Bill
and I made joint visits and presentations to DOE and others to provide a

**********************************************************************


?united
front? and mitigate adverse effects.  During the past six months, I have had 
the
opportunity to work closely with Bill and sincerely believe that he would
provide a complementary set of skills and capabilities.

The 300 people that will initially form the Institute deserve the maximum
opportunity for success.  I firmly believe that I have demonstrated the
commitment, leadership skills and energy necessary to successfully merge the
best aspects of GRI and IGT. I do not believe that you will be able to 
identify
another individual that has as high a likelihood of forging an integrated team
that will maximize the impact of the Institute on its current and future
customer bases.

I look forward to our continued interactions.

Stan Borys

		 Subject: Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees

Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors 
meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect 
EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent 
that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.

Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the 
Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.

Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the 
Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the 
outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on 
EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the 
outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued 
service.

Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you 
would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on 
last year's "annual meeting" agenda.

Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

February with a Press Release and external website called EnronCredit.com. 

Prior to making the public announcement, we intend to send a letter to the 
respective CFO/Treasurer/Finance Director of the reference credits letting 
them know that we will begin making markets in bankruptcy swaps on their 
names.  We have worked with Enron's many origination groups to remove names 
of customers that are particularly sensitive or where we might have 
confidential information.  In anticipation of potential direct feedback to 
the account representatives of the referenced entities, please see the 
attached list of initial reference credits and have a look at the test 
version of the web site at test.enroncredit.com (at certain times during the 
test phase, the web site may not be available in all locations).  

If you have any questions or comments, please contact either me or  Bryan 
Seyfried who is leading the effort  at 44 020 7783 7907.

Thanks!

To get this process moving El Paso (EPECC) suggests that we draft an MOU, I 
fully concur.  The attached EPECC MOU is based on our PetroNet MOU Draft, 
with some minor changes.  This MOU lays out the numbers they need to get to, 
as well as the terms and conditions. The xl attachment simply lays out the 
construction cost of their system.  Lets get together Tuesday and discuss 
this.  EARLY!!!

FYI -- More information from EPA to back up its recent announcement:

Oxygenates in Gasoline

Congress required, in the Clean Air Act of 1990, that areas of the country 
with the worst ozone smog problems use reformulated gasoline (RFG) with an 
increased oxygen content of 2%. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia 
presently use reformulated gasoline (RFG), either because of the 
Congressional mandate, or because some areas have voluntarily chosen to use 
RFG to help achieve their clean air goals.  Methyl tertiary-butyl ether 
(MTBE) is the oxygen additive most commonly used by the petroleum industry to 
satisfy the RFG mandate.  MTBE is used in approximately 87% of RFG, with 
ethanol being the second most commonly used additive.  Of those areas listed 
below, only Milwaukee and Chicago use RFG that is primarily ethanol.


Areas Required to Use RFG

Areas That Have Voluntarily Chosen to Use RFG

Los Angeles, CA
San Diego, CA
Hartford, CT
New York City (NY-CT-NJ)
Greater Philadelphia (PA-NJ-DE-MD)
Chicago (IL-WI-IN)
Baltimore, MD
Houston, TX
Milwaukee, WI
Sacramento, CA
The State of Connecticut (that portion not part of
NYC)
The State of Delaware (that portion not part of Phil.)
The District of Columbia
Kentucky portion of Cincinnati Metro Area
Louisville, KY
Maryland - DC suburbs and two other nearby counties
The State of Massachusetts
St. Louis, MO
New Hampshire Portion of Greater Boston
The State of New Jersey (that portion not part of NYC
and Phil.)
New York counties near NYC
The State of Rhode Island
Texas - Dallas-Fort Worth area
Virginia - DC suburbs, Richmond, Norfolk-Virginia
Beach-Newport News

Since the late 1970s, MTBE also has been used by the petroleum industry in 
much smaller amounts as an octane enhancer to replace lead. Approximately 4.5 
billion gallons of MTBE are used each year in gasoline (275,000 barrels per 
day out of a total of 8.2 million barrels/day of gasoline), an increase of 
more than 3 times since Congress's 1990 mandate.

MTBE in Water

Since MTBE is very soluble in water and does not "cling" to soil well, it has 
a tendency to migrate much more quickly into water than other components of 
gasoline.  Recent testing by the United States Geological Survey show 
detections of MTBE in approximately 20% of the ground water in RFG areas, 
while there is only a 2% detection rate in non-RFG areas.  Most of these 
detections are below the levels of public health concern and are within the 
range
EPA has set for a taste and odor water advisory for MTBE at 20 to 40 parts 
per billion.  Small individual fuel spills (more than 9 million gallons of 
gasoline each year) and storm water runoff contribute to low level detections 
of MTBE in water supplies.  MTBE detections at higher concentrations usually 
result from leaking underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks and 
pipelines.  Even though significant air quality gains have been made using 
RFG, these air benefits can be maintained without using MTBE and without 
endangering the nation's water resources.

MTBE - Call to Action

In response to the growing concerns regarding MTBE in water, EPA 
Administrator Browner appointed an independent Blue Ribbon Panel of experts 
to investigate the use of oxygen additives in gasoline.  The Panel called for 
significant reduction in the use of MTBE in gasoline and recommended that 
Congress and EPA take action to lift the oxygen mandate and clean up MTBE 
contamination.  EPA fully supports the Panel recommendations and is taking 
steps to strengthen its underground storage tank, safe drinking water, 
remediation, and research programs. Upon release of the Panel's report in 
September 1999, EPA immediately began working with and encouraging Congress 
to pass legislation that responded to the Panel's recommendations.  To date, 
legislation that would solve  this problem has not moved forward.  EPA is now 
providing Congress with a framework for legislation that will give EPA the 
authority to significantly reduce or eliminate MTBE.  EPA is also taking 
action to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as a 
backup to the needed Congressional action.  A TSCA rulemaking is procedurally 
burdensome and may take several years to complete.

Ethanol Use Will Expand

Current annual ethanol production is about 1.5 billion gallons.  Of this 
total, about 30 percent is used in RFG during the summer in Federally 
designated non-attainment areas.  About 20 percent of ethanol production is 
used in the winter oxygenate program in Federally designated areas where 
carbon monoxide is a problem.  The remaining 50 percent of production is used 
in conventional gasoline markets around the United States to enhance octane 
and extend fuel supplies.

With today's announcement by Secretary Glickman and Administrator Browner, 
ethanol use is expected to continue to grow.  Provided air quality gains 
achieved to date are not reduced, ethanol will continue to be used very much 
as it is used today.  In areas of the country where it is heavily used, 
ethanol will continue to be favored based on its price, availability and 
environmental benefits.   Other areas may also find ethanol to be an economic 
way to maintain air quality benefits that had been achieved with the use of 
MTBE.  Without the renewable fuels standard, some petroleum-based substitutes 
for ethanol may emerge over time.  The proposed renewable fuels standard 
would ensure that the current market for ethanol would be maintained and 
expand over time.

The renewable fuels standard will be met through the use of fuels made from a 
variety of renewable feedstocks. While most ethanol now is made from corn, 
other crops, such as wheat and sorghum, have and could also be used.  In 
addition, new conversion technologies now in development are expected to be 
available in the future for efficient conversion of cellulosic material to 
ethanol.  These technologies would make possible the broader use of a wide 
array of renewable feedstocks, including agricultural waste and residue, such 
as corn stalks, and dedicated crops, such as switchgrass.

The President has set a goal to triple U.S. use of biobased products and 
bioenergy by 2010.  The Administration's FY 2001 budget proposes an increase 
of $96 million (56 percent) to support biobased products and bioenergy 
research and development, demonstration and commercialization, and outreach 
and education activities.  The President also directed USDA's Commodity 
Credit Corporation to provide up to $100 million in FY 2000 and up to $150 
million in 2001 and 2002 in incentive payments to ethanol and other bioenergy 
producers to expand production of biobased fuels.  Payments will be made on a 
portion of the increase in agricultural commodities purchased for expanded 
bioenergy production, with smaller and cooperatively-owned facilities 
receiving higher payment rates.

I followed up yesterday on this issue and was advised that the sign off is 
circulating with in the St. Paul organization, due to the size of the 
payoff.  The adjuster indicated that this process was routine.  He 
anticipates having a letter/settlement agreement out to us by Friday.  Walt 
if this comes to you by chance would you let me know immediately.

Rod, Here is a brief update for Stan's staff meeting.  Hope you won't mind 
giving a summary, if appropriate.

Thanks, JNG

MOPS Disposition:  Bill Malmquist (Williams Field Services) canceled the 
meeting that had been scheduled for Wednesday of last week with James 
Harvey.  I will follow-up with James to see what reasons were given, but 
obviously this is another indication of the general lack of enthusiasm the 
other MOPS owners have for dealing with our ROFR issue.  The Williams 
business segment that has responsibility for MOPS, reports up through Steve 
Malcolm in Tulsa.  I have not dealt with this new organization in the past, 
but I will begin making contact "up the ladder".  If Stan knows any of the 
top guys and wouldn't mind making a contact, it might be helpful.  Meantime, 
if I make any progress I'll get word to Stan.  

Here is the applicable Williams organization chart for reference:

 Keith Bailey

 Steve Malcolm - President, Williams Energy Services which includes 
gathering, processing, and trading/marketing
 [Malcolm is organizationally equivalent to Cuba Waddlington].

 Steve Springer - Sr VP Gathering & Processing

 Allen Armstrong - VP 

 Dan McVay - Director

 Bill Malmquist - Manager 

  NOTE:  Malcolm, Springer, and Armstrong are located in Tulsa. 

Alaska/Canada Pipeline - trip to Calgary:

We attended a meeting in Calgary hosted by Purvin & Gertz with many of the 
stakeholders for the Alaskan/Canadian gas pipeline project in attendance.  
This rather large industry group (including NBP and GPG) has commissioned 
Purvin and Gertz to develop a detailed comparison of cost, schedule, and 
producer netback for various pipeline solutions.  There seems to be only two 
pipeline alternatives being seriously considered: 
 1) the original ANGST route which would run along the existing TAPS oil line 
and then along the ALCAN highway into the Yukon territory and BC; and 
 2) the proposed "over the top route" that would run offshore Alaska in the 
Beaufort Sea and then up the McKenzie River valley down into Alberta.  

No alliances or partner groups have really formed as yet.  It seems that most 
are also conducting their own evaluation, and are waiting for clearer 
definition before declaring their intentions.  Of course, Foothills Pipeline 
is convinced that the ANGST route is the only one that makes sense and is 
working hard to illustrate the benefits of the previously 
approved/certificated route.  Interestingly, Foothills is not a sponsor of 
the P&G study, 

We have communicated our interest in the project to Foothills, BP Amoco, 
Phillips, and even Williams Pipeline.  In addition, I have scheduled a 
meeting this Friday to discuss the project with Exxon-Mobil.

Larry, very interesting reports.   It may be wise for TW (and other 
companies) to monitor and comment through channels you consider appropriate 
on the developing proposals for the statutes waiving immunity for contract 
claims.  This reminds me of a discussion I had with Steve Boos (who as you 
know is legislative counsel to the Council (or a similar title)  at a CLE in 
Albuquerque.  We discussed the effort last year to provide a limited waiver 
which he suggested he favored, and he asked whether it would be an inducement 
for business to invest on reservation to have a waiver of immunity for suits 
on contracts with the Nation.  Of course, I said it would be and we talked 
briefly about what states and the U. S. do.  I'd be interested in further 
intelligence on that initiative.

I'd also appreciate a copy of the agenda for the financial meetings.

Thanks for your always valuable window on Window Rock.

Lynn

I also received a call today from Luralene Tapahe, Esq. of the NNERTF and the
Department of Justice concerning another client. I took advantage of the call
to discuss with Ms. Tapahe my discussion of March 16th with Akhtar Zaman and
she generally confirmed what Mr. Zaman had told me.

Ms. Tapahe also advised me that as of today, no replacement on the NNERTF from
the President's Office had been made for Sharon Noel, Esq. whom, as you know,
is (acting) Chief of Staff and, apparently, will be too busy to serve on the
NNERTF.

As you probably know, there is a big meeting in Window Rock next week called 
by
President Begaye to discuss whether the Navajo Nation should try to charter 
its
own bank (more broadly, on the subject of how to find capital for 
development).
The cast of characters for this meeting is quite impressive. If anyone wants a
copy of the agenda, please let me know.

Finally, I attended a meeting of the Navajo Nation Council's Judiciary
Committee yesterday. After some spirited debate, they agreed to recommend to
the full Council a "Little Tucker Act" with a limited waiver of sovereign
immunity to enforce contracts.

Walt, I am not aware of any Board changes being considered but you should 
call Stan and Ted to see if they have any suggestions.
I would like to see a draft today.

		 Subject: Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees

Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors 
meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect 
EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent 
that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.

Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the 
Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.

Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the 
Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the 
outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on 
EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the 
outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued 
service.

Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you 
would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on 
last year's "annual meeting" agenda.

Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

Dear Natural Gas Executive,

With Natural Gas prices being sustained at levels never before seen, the
publishing of NGW's Daily Price Snapshot: The Natural Gas Market Outlook:
Winter 2000-01 could not come at a better time.

The Natural Gas Market Outlook: Winter 2000-01, written by the staff of
Natural Gas Week and NGW's Daily Price Snapshot, deals with opportunities
and potential pitfalls for the natural gas industry this coming winter.
Natural Gas Market Outlook: Winter 2000-2001 focuses on issues and market
factors that could play a role in the gas industry's performance during its
highest demand season, and one that is predicted to be a stern test for the
pipeline grid and the market in general.

As I am sure most of you know, the payout of 1999 performance bonuses over 
the past 
couple of days has lifted the moral of our company significantly.  It is a 
major positive event 
for EOTT because:
1. Performance bonuses in 1998 and 1999 were zero
2. The year end write-off  re: alleged theft, inappropriate NGL trading and 
NGL Midcon 
activities wind-down triggered the need for a substantial amount of API 
support from Enron 

There are a few people that I would like to acknowledge and express my 
appreciation to for 
this critically important and positive development for our company:

A.  Stan Horton and John Duncan, Chairman of the EOTT Board Compensation 
committee were
very understanding and most supportive in our request.  Because of the large, 
year end API
payment Enron had to make, it would have been easy for them to just say "NO!"

B.  Mary Ellen with her support team of Lloyd Jobe, Pat Hudson, Lynette 
LeBlanc, Beth Velasquez,
Renda Angel did a magnificent job setting up and implementing the process of 
fairly allocating 
the bonus pool that we did not know we would have until after our board 
meeting next week.

C.  EOTT Management and Supervisors who responded very quickly and in a most 
professional 
manner to the bonus allocation process.

I am confident that this bonus distribution will reinforce everyone's 
committment to continue to
build a much stronger, viable entity that is well on its way to earning and 
paying full distributions in 
the not too distant future.

Thanks again to for the cooperation and support.

Attached is a detailed report on the deals that GPG Bus Dev is currently 
looking at, and a historic log of prior activities.  It is very much a "work 
in progress", and will be updated weekly.  I plan to share it with anyone 
within GPG that would find it useful probably on a monthly basis. 

Your comments are welcome.

Stan,

Attached is an update of the component IDD deal that we entered into 2 weeks 
ago.  As predicted by the techinicals, the market has dropped considerably 
and our IDD spread has grown from an initial value of $0.34/mmbtu to the 
current spread of $0.43/mmbtu.   The price risk on the December, '00 
locked-in price is currently trading at a $0.105/mmbtu gain.

As you prepare the list of errors that were discovered as we went from an $14 
million dollar loss to a $4 million gain
for 1Q2000 please solicit input from Dana, David , Susan and Steve Myers - 
and , of course, Arthur Andersen and Solarc.
We would like the list to include:
The Error
$ amount
Type/nature of the error
Individual Accountable
The Proposed Remedy

As Stan explained, this exercise is not to play the "blame game", but to 
ensure that we learn from our mistakes and do
 not repeat them.

If at all possible will you please have the first draft of this document 
completed this Friday, May 19th.

I am asking Shelly to assist you in this effot.  Please call on her for 
help.  thanks,  mike

Susan, I spoke this morning with Nancy Manderson (outside counsel for our 
crime policy insurer).  She has accepted my changes to the Assignment and 
Release, and she will be forwarding an original of the Assignment and Release 
to EOTT for execution.  She said we will have our check for $2,503,000.00 
next week!  The check will be delivered to Phillip Bair with our insurance 
broker.

We also had a long conversation about the insurer's claim against Gas 
Producers.  I shared with Nancy some of the research we have done on the 
conversion claim against Gas Producers.  I assured her that EOTT would fully 
cooperate if the insurer did pursue the claim against Gas Producers.  I 
gathered from her comments, however, that the insurer is concerned that Gas 
Producers may not have sufficient assets to satisfy anything but a small 
judgment.  I do not know whether the insurer has actually conducted a 
"financial investigation" of Gas Producers.

Steve and Lori:

 I spoke with Dana this afternoon, and I really think that the
wisest, by far, way to approach Koch on this is to call Tye tomorrow and
tell him we are exercising our rights to delay the filing of the S-1 under
the following clause of the registration rights provisions of the Purchase
and Sale Agreement:

"and provided further, that if the General Partner determines in its good
faith judgment that a postponement for up to four months of the filing or
effectiveness of the requested registration or the sales pursuant to an
effective registration would be in the best interests of EEP and its
Partners due to a pending transaction, investigation or other event, the
filing or effectiveness of such registration statement or any sales pursuant
thereto may be deferred for up to four months, but not thereafter."

Dana makes three points.

 First, there are some unresolved environmental issues involving
properties purchased from Koch, and although we do not believe there's a big
problem right now (we think Koch is liable under its indemnity agreement),
we have not confirmed the extent of the problem nor Koch's willingness to
honor its commitment, and it would be better to pin this down before making
any decision on whether or to what extent they are material.

 Second, there are uncertainties relating to the Koch contract that
we will probably have a much better handle on next month; these are serious
issues, but it is premature to disclose them until we have a better handle
on them.

 Third, we are looking at a possible material acquisition, and we may
even be entering into an agreement in principal or otherwise moving down the
probability curve sometime soon, but it is clearly premature to announce
this.

 Thus, we have both positive and negative events, the materiality of
which is subject to some uncertainty.

 As you know, as long as EOTT has a proper corporate purpose for not
disclosing material inside information and insiders are not trading, it can
keep the information confidential, even if it is material, for a limited
period of time.

 Filing a registration statement that omits possibly material
information is not advisable even if sales are not being made at the time of
filing, since market participants can reasonably rely on the information in
the registration statement in making purchases or sales.  Since some of the
information may be negative and some may be positive, there would arguably
be exposure to EOTT from both buyers and sellers in the market were it to
file a registration statement that omitted material information.  Although I
am not saying any of this information is material at this time, it arguably
could be or could develop to the point where it is.  This is just a bad time
to be filing a registration statement.  This is the very situation that the
above quoted language was designed to deal with.  Clearly we have a pending
investigation (of the environmental issue), a pending transaction (the
possible acquisition) and another event (the contractual issues).

 Obviously EOTT should not disclose the information to Koch just as
it should keep it confidential from others.  Thus, the best approach is to
call Tye Darland tomorrow and tell him that we are exercising our rights
under the above quoted language and tell him that for obvious reasons we
cannot tell him exactly what  the "pending investigation, transaction or
other event" is.  Dana believes that the situations will all have a decent
chance of clarifying themselves within about a month.  So I would say that
you can calm Koch down by saying that at this point we do not think there is
any realistic possibility that we will take another four months, and in fact
we think we are talking about a few days, but we just don't know at this
point.  We can say we are poised to file quickly after we determine that the
postponement period is ended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------

To all employees:


EOTT announced its financial results for the fourth quarter of 1999 today.  A
full copy of the press release is attached.  Results set out in the press
release include that recurring operating income nearly doubled to $10.5 
million
in the most recent quarter from $5.3 million in the same period in 1998.  
Crude
oil lease volumes increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 1999 
compared
to last year, with the North America-East of the Rockies segment volumes up 
26%
to an average of 406,600 barrels per day.  Acquisitions made in late 1998 and
early 1999 were the primary reasons for the growth in recurring operating 
income
and lease volumes.  As a result of the realization of operating synergies from
recent acquisitions, recurring operating expenses declined to $35.7 million in
the fourth quarter of 1999 from $40.7 million in the third quarter of the same
year.

For the full year 1999, EOTT reported net income of $7.6 million before
non-recurring items and the cumulative effect of the accounting change, or 
$0.30
per diluted unit, compared to a loss of $4.1 million, or $(0.21) per diluted
unit, in 1998.  In total, EOTT reported a loss of $2.2 million, or $(0.09) per
diluted unit, before the cumulative effect of an accounting change.

1999 was a turnaround year for EOTT's operations, with recurring operating
income up  nearly five-fold over the prior year.  With our increased scale and
scope from recent acquisitions and our continuing success in reducing 
operating
costs, we believe we are well positioned for 2000.

 While there were some very positive aspects to our fourth quarter 
performance,
the overall results were disappointing due, in large part, to the negative
financial impact of certain unauthorized activities which occurred in our
now-discontinued NGL activities in the mid continent region.  You may rest
assured that the company intends to take swift and thorough legal action 
against
the individual responsible for these activities, but you also need to be aware
that these events will likely spark the curiosity of many within our industry.
Accordingly, it is almost certain that EOTT employees will receive phone calls
and inquiries from business acquaintances and counterparties wanting to know
more about the unauthorized activities mentioned in our earnings release.

These matters are extremely sensitive and  potentially damaging to the 
company's
reputation, and any indiscreet or unauthorized comments by EOTT personnel 
about
these matters may only serve to harm the company's position.  Accordingly, I 
am
asking that EOTT employees refrain from discussing  the unauthorized 
activities
discussed in our earnings release with people outside of our company.  
Generally
speaking, any media or other external inquiries or requests for information
about any item(s) mentioned in our earnings release should be referred to Dave
Schafer with the Enron GPG Communications Group, at 713-853-6758.  Susan Ralph
and our Credit Department will be responsible for handling any questions which
may come in concerning the company's financial strength or credit posture, and
Dana Gibbs will be responsible for addressing any specific questions which may
come in concerning any effect which any of these matters may have upon any
specific commercial transaction(s)  to which EOTT is a party.  If there are 
any
questions about any of these guidelines, or if you become unsure of how to
handle any particular situation, please contact your supervisor or EOTT's 
Legal
Department right away.

I am extremely angered by these unauthorized activities, not only because of 
the
effect they have had on our 1999 results, but also because of the unfair way
they have undermined countless hours of hard work  by hundreds of good and
dedicated EOTT employees in 1999. These events are unfortunate, but they will
not have a lasting effect upon our company.  EOTT's underlying earning power
remains strong and our prospects for the future remain bright.

Your adherence to the guidelines set forth above will assist EOTT in getting
through this difficult, but passing, situation.  Thank you in advance for your
help.

And finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank all EOTT employees for 
the
tremendous job you have done in lowering our expenses and levels of spending
throughout the organization.  Your initiatives, suggestions and cooperation in
this area will be a major factor in helping EOTT strive to attain its 
financial
goals for 2000.

Mike

Larry,

Bob Hill has asked that I write this note to obtain an exemption from the 
standing policy of not making investments outside of North America 
(established by the MPL Policy Committee) if you would like us to proceed 
with the investment evaluation of GATX .   If the policy exemption is not 
granted, we will discontinue our efforts and focus resources on other areas.  
Here is some background information that might be useful in making your 
decision.

Business - GATX Terminals business unit is in engaged in the storage and 
distribution services to petroleum and chemical customers worldwide.  The 
assets consist of 17 terminaling facilities, ownership interest in 4 refined 
product pipelines, and 11 joint ventures, which in aggregate have a book 
value approximating $1 billion.  The business generated $26 million of net 
income in 1999 on $294 million of gross income and employs approximately 
1,000 employees.

I have been informed that roughly half of the business operations lie outside 
of U.S. borders.  Significant terminal operations are located in Asia and 
some in Europe.  Also, the pipeline business segment has operations in the 
U.K. and Mexico.  Since this deal is a planned cash for stock transaction, 
the opportunity to cherry pick U.S. assets is not an option.

Foreign Taxation Issue - In general, investments outside the U.S. lessens the 
tax efficiency structure that partners value and currently enjoy.  In 
addition, foreign income taxes will complicate a unitholder's tax return 
filing.

Qualified Income - According to David Boryck, distribution of petroleum and 
chemicals to end-users is not qualified income.  It is unknown to me, how 
much of the business this represents for GATX...potential issue.

Investment Portfolio Character - Given the size and nature of this business, 
this transaction would change the character of NBP's investment portfolio.  

Competitive Bid - Other bidders in the industry will have an advantage in 
finding G&A cost efficiencies with merging this operation into their 
business, putting us at a disadvantage in the bidding process.

The above two issues can be mitigated by jointly bidding with a strong 
operating partner.  

Cash Flow Impact - I have not seen any numbers, but assuming the transaction 
is accretive, the scope of this investment should have positive impact on MLP 
cash flows.

Please provide your feedback.

Paul

Stan,

I'm thinking through that right now.  Frankly, the problem I see is in being 
able to put an agenda together that would be attractive enough for our CEO 
task force members.  I haven't figured out how to make a face to face meeting 
before the September board meeting worthwhile, although a conference call 
might work.  We probably could develop a formal task force response to the 
strawman, but in some ways I think the first meeting notes, draft principles 
and the concerns paper covered some of the turf.

So I'm thinking of an alternative - and please think of this only as a 
maybe.  Suppose at the September board meeting I have a closed meeting on the 
principles & scope & whatever else we can manage, and then have you come in 
and talk to everybody in general session.  We could work out the content of 
your talk, but it would be centered on the value of uniform practices, their 
applicability to electric wholesale markets, and the "EISB" approach.  
Perhaps we could get Chuck Watson to help you.

There would be tough and probing questions - which you would know in advance.

How does this sit with you?  I think it might be an interesting discussion 
that would help to increase the collective knowledge and support.  I do not 
have internal concurrence & support on this idea, but if you like it I'll try 
to get it.

On another matter - I really need 5 or 6 examples  of areas where wholesale 
electric practices would be useful and appropriate.  The question on the 
floor is "Exactly what are the areas and types of practices we might develop 
for wholesale electric markets?"

On the retail side the answer is easy, because we already have them (e.g., 
customer enrollment, billing & payments, metering,  load profiling, etc.).  
But there really is no such list on the wholesale electric side.

Can you or Jeff help?  We can't just say "it's up to the members".  Having a 
list would help demonstrate value.  I need something by next Thursday for an 
internal strategy meeting.

Thanks
  -Mike

Mike:

Any suggestions as to when our respective committees could meet to begin
discussing matters such as principles, scope, governance, organization,
etc.?

If a meeting is not possible, is it possible to get your committee's
response to the "strawman" I sent to you?

Thanks,
Stan

FYI -- Ken Lay is coming to D.C. tomorrow to do meetings with the Greater 
Houston Partnership on a number of Air Quality issues.  As I thought MTBE 
might come up with EPA and some of the Texas members of Congress, I added a 
section on MTBE and Enron's activities/position to talking points I produced 
for him.   (attachment below)

Just a quick note to let everyone know Larry spoke with Mr. Trujillo at the 
end of last week.  He told Larry that he or Mr. Zaman would get back to 
Johnny or Larry about whether or not we would meet.

We await word.

In light of Walt's message, we'll need to elect a new chairman from the 
existing Board members.  SWD

EOTT's bylaws currently require that we have a Chairman of the Board.  As a 
result of amendments to the bylaws that were made in 1994, the duties of the 
Chairman of the Board are quite limited.  The bylaws provide that "the 
Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and 
of the Board of Directors.  The Chairman of the Board shall act as a liaison 
between the officers of the Corporation and the Board of Directors."

Ted Gaylord has advised that he no longer wishes to serve as Board Chairman, 
although he does intend to remain on the Board.  There appear to be no other 
changes.  Suggest the four of us discuss the " Board Chairman"  situation as 
soon as possible. I have a call into Baird to explore (1) whether we need a 
Board Chairman per se, and (2) whether there will be any "disclosure" issues 
around Ted stepping down as Board Chairman.  SWD

Walt, I am not aware of any Board changes being considered but you should 
call Stan and Ted to see if they have any suggestions.
I would like to see a draft today.

		 Subject: Annual Election of EOTT Directors and Committees

Prior to the distribution of materials for the May 15 EOTT Board of Directors 
meeting, the sole shareholder (Enron Liquids Holding Corp.) needs to reelect 
EOTT's Board of Directors.  This will be accomplished by a written consent 
that will be executed on behalf of Enron Liquids Holding Corp.

Also, at the May 15 meeting, EOTT's directors will elect the members of the 
Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee for the next year.

Are you aware of any changes to the EOTT Board, the Audit Committee, or the 
Compensation Committee?  In some past years, Ted Gaylord has polled the 
outside directors to ensure that they intended to continue their service on 
EOTT's Board and committees.  If you would like, I will ask Ted to poll the 
outside directors again this year as to their intentions for continued 
service.

Also, we need to start preparing an agenda for the May 15 meeting.  If you 
would like, I will forward to you tomorrow a draft agenda that is based on 
last year's "annual meeting" agenda.

Please let me know your thoughts on these matters.   Thanks.

stan, i have been out of the office with no access to
e-mail, thus my failure to respond for which i
apologize.  i had previously told louie that i thought
15 mil plus 2 mil per year (which i suspected they
were looking for) exceeded my view of the settlement
value of  the controversy--which, i suppose, comes as
no surprise. i do believe that if we settle, we should
cover our expansions during the term. jim

The offer letter was sent yesterday.  It was sent overnight and faxed to Mr. 
Zaman's office.  There was some minor word smithing to the version discussed 
last Friday.  The only true change was a modification of the $$ on the 
incremental payment table.  When finalizing the document with James Centilli, 
certain trailing decimals places to one factor which were hidden on the 
spreadsheet were deleted.  This change resulted in a total reduction to the 
payment figures of between one and two percent.

A clean signed copy is being mailed/faxed to this distribution list.

Johnny spoke with Mr. Ram Das earlier this week about the offer letter and a 
meeting.  Mr.  Zaman was out of the office most of this week and will be 
traveling all of the next two weeks.  Johnny hopes to arrange a meeting with 
Mr. Zaman during these travels.  I'll likely attend with Johnny.

Thanks for sending me a copy of your e-mail.

says on the standard terms and conditions--Strate talking or litigation,
or something else? If it is Strate talking, when and to whom?

Take Care,

LAR
