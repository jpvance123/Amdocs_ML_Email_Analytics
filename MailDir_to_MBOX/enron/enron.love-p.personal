I thought about that email during the game Saturday. But of course, going
into the weekend I had lost ALL optimism because I had seen us play
barely-above-average football and I had seen UF light up everybody. But how
about that crowd! And we were without several defensive starters, including
number 54 in the 2nd half.  Truly astounding.

I was sorry Joe wouldn't let us go over to where some of the birds were
stationed, but I take it he sometimes has the sense that certain times are
just not good for the birds. And he's always going to do what's best for
the health of the birds.  In any event, can you believe Tiger flew out over
the Florida section before the game? Someone next to me said, "I hope
that's an omen." Turned out, it was!

Thanks again for your role in the scholarship, Phillip. Vet school awards
night is Monday, Feb. 11.  We'll be in touch later with details, but in
essence it's a 7 p.m. program at the school, usually lasts 2.5 hours and we
have a reception afterwards.

Hope your flight back included some Gator alumni!

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20

? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=

of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Good afternoon Phillip.  My name is Scott Schaunaman.
We spoke yesterday regarding engineering opportunities
at Enron.  I am currently seeking a position as a
junior-project engineer.

My background is in gas pipeline simulation and design
as well as miscellaneous project management for
pipeline terminals.  I currently work at Fluor Daniel
in Pipeline Engineering.  I am seeking a position with
an operating company as a junior-project engineer with
responsibilities in project cost, scheduling,
engineering, safety, environmental, and construction
supervision for pipeline projects. If you are aware of
any such opportunity, I would be interested in
pursuing a career with Enron.  Please see the attached
resume for more details regarding my qualifications.
If you have any questions or require additional
information, please feel free to contact me via e-mail
(saschaunaman@yahoo.com), or at 281-263-5667. Thanks
for your time and consideration, and I look forward to
hearing back from you.

Sincerely,
Scott Schaunaman

P.S. Great game last night.  I was getting concerned
about losing our first game on our new turf.  The last
2 innings were great.  Have a good one.

Here are the top issues which the top performers in risk identified in this 
morning's meeting in no particular order:

1.  All physical curves out by 2:30.  All financial curves out by 3:15.  
2.  Streamline nightly checkout process.
3.  No more deal tickets.
4. Systems person or persons on the floor.
5. Notification of any curve change in the system.
6. Specific cut off time for all deal tickets.
7. Cross regional training
8. Stock options
9.  Back-ups for all big books
10. Combat Pay
11. Only 2nd yr analysts.
12. Automatic notification when a deal has been changed.  (Canada,  
Logistics,  or trader)

I don't think any of these requests is unreasonable.

CONCERNING THE TITLEIST "ENRON" LOGO BALLS.
THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS:
    1. MY BID WAS FOR  19.99, NOT 61.00
    2. I NEVER PLACED 1,600.00 AS THE  MAXIMUM BUT ONE OF MY BIDS WAS FOR 16.00.
    3. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE BUT I  SURE AS HELL DIDN'T BID A MAX OF 
1,600.00 FOR ANY GOLF BALLS ESPECIALLY ENRON'S.

Just a couple of points that I am not sure I mentioned to you:

1.	I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease the
house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She
obviouly has not done that.

2.	The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to
take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in
Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his
estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had
not been formally appointed.

3.	Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him to
pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm
surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.

With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to
court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:

1.	The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are put
back in to the estate.

2.	The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.

3.	The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her
distribution.

4.	The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in April
1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of the
estate.

5.	If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's
death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.

6.	Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as
executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.

7.	Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my
family.

I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am willing
to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's
death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his.  I
will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy left
to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while he
was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay the
value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car for,
but that she did not put in the estate.

I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been very
busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need a
new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.

I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

Dianne

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

The decision to close the Body Shop came after the December 15 payroll run, so you will incur a deduction on your December 15 paycheck.  However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck.  

As a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers.

Oh....the old profit and loss.  I haven't had to deal with that nightmare 
since
MBA, which I can say I am happy about.  No, I did not throw away any pictures 
of
you.  Just Tom and the 2 I have of Justin (a.k.a. ass).  I would never do 
that!!
Should I even toy with the statement "things would be alot different"?  Just
kidding!!  No, I am sure we would be the best of friends like always.  Hey, do
you still have that picture your mom took of us forever ago?  Back in the day?
Just curious....sometimes I like to see how much I have aged!  About coming
home, I have no immediate plans for a visit.  I have been swamped.  My wedding
plans are coming along good and I am getting ready to move into Jason's (Dad 
is
not too happy about that one).  I think I will be in there by the second week 
of
May.  Anyhow, as soon as some time frees up I will come home.  When I do, do 
you
think you really will have a free schedule.....doubt that one!!  Family life 
(I
am sure) keeps you busy.  Hopefully this time I will be able to see your 
little
one.  OK, I am going to say one more thing I shouldn't (but what the
heck).....Ashley gave me a picture of me holding Jackson and I couldn't help 
but
wonder what if.  Sorry if that is bad.....but one day all of that will be 
gone.
Jason is completely wonderful..

Profit and Loss.  I forgot that you are in the touchy feely are of
corporate life.  The new position is very challenging and educational so
far.
I just found out that the last rockets game is on Wednesday of this week
and I have my softball league on that night.  I guess I will have to record
it and watch it later.  Oh, Well.
That is great about Kelly.  We have no immediate plans to add to the
family.  The one is keeping us plenty busy as it is.
I hope you didn't throw out any pictures of me last night(that would be
rude).  I am sure if we lived closer that things would be a lot different
and we would interact a lot more(outta site outta mind).
Do you have any plans to come back to town anytime soon?  Be sure and give
me some notice so that I can clear the old schedule.  Talk to you soon.

OK, not to be stupid but...what are P&Ls???  I suppose the management
consulting
world does not use that.  Well, I guess I figured that you would be staying
in
Houston.  Are you happy in your new position?  If you ever did come up
here, it
would be fabulous!!  Maybe we will settle on visits for now.

Dad would be really happy to go to the Rockets last game.  They were in
town
here last Tues., but I was in Seattle for work.

How are you liking your new house?  Are you and Ashley planning on any more
kids?  Any time soon?  Kelly Houge is preg. and is due November 28.  It
will be
weird not having her at my wedding.....

I was going through pictures last night....throwing out the ones that had
ex-boyfriends in them....and thought of you.  Not the ex-boyfriend
part...but I
did run into pics with you in them.  I really wish that we could be more a
part
of each other's lives.  It would be fun....maybe one day you really will
take a
job out here.  Wishful thinking I suppose!!

Tell Jimmy hi for me!!  Is he dating??

I got jimmy on last October.  He seems to be enjoying it.

The new stadium is phenomenal.  It really looks like an old time park.  I
need to call you dad and see if he wants to go to the rockets season
finale.  Rumor has it that Charles is going to play so that he can walk off
the court on his own power.

I just took another job within enron working for the east desk doing daily
gas P&L's.  Should be challenging with high exposure.  So, it looks like we
will not be coming to denver any time soon, with the exception of this
fall.

Your dad did look a little different, but I got used to it pretty quick.  I
am sure it will be a little more difficult for you.  Take care.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

Hello!

I will meet you in the middle. . .work until noon on Friday, and then get out 
of here.  It is hard to justify our team taking the entire day off since our 
responsbilities are not completely dependent on daily trading activities or 
nomination activities.  That, of course, IS TRUE for Logistics and Risk.

To be consistent, I will give the OA team the same info.  Volume Mgmt. and 
Settlements will be jealous.

Thanks,
Carrie

Phillip ... greetings from Auburn, where in 9 days the eagle will fly, the
stadium will rock and the tigers will welcome ball state to our newly named
"jungle."

WE have this week received the $12,500 matching money from Enron.

Also, can you email me your work number again. I think the dean of the vet
school wants to call and say thanks for setting up the scholarship.

I still have you on my calendar for a tour of the raptor center on Friday,
Oct. 12, the day before we (am I getting giddy here?) shock the number one
ranked gators.

Phillip,
I wanted to get back with you on Calpine.  My co-worker said that they are
not going to be hiring until after the 1st of the year.  They need people
desperately, but they just don't have it in their budget for this year.  I
will keep you posted on other things in the meantime.  Thanks!

Hi Phillip,
 
Thanks for your winning bid on the  Alabama-Auburn record.  Sorry, I don't take Paypal. I would prefer a  cashiers check or money order, or if you can stand the wait, a personal check  will do.  I will send it in a Priority Mail envelope sandwiched between  several layers of corrugated cardboard and I will insure it.  The total  will be $47.60. My mailing address is:
 
Tim Cocker
141 McCallie Lane

Hope you enjoy it.
 
Regards,
Tim

Phillip - this fall is nearing it's end for recruiting.  Schools are selected 
by an executive committee and program management.  I suggest that early next 
spring, you contact Celeste Roberts and discuss your request with her.  
Celeste is my Director, however she is out on maternity leave at this time.

Thank you

Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal 
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

Hello!

I wanted to pass on a compliment that you all received this weekend. . . 

Jason Williams told me that the entire Central risk team was "extremely 
helpful and patient", that you "respond to requests with a great attitude," 
and that he was especially impressed with your responsive to the traders' 
requests even though these things cause you to stay later in the evening.

Keep it up!  You impress people!
Carrie

Phil,

I have been really busy the last couple of weeks. Well, come to think of it I
have been really busy ever since I started this job. Yesterday, I was in Town
and Country at 7:30 a.m. then straight to Edna, Texas by 11:00 a.m then
straight to the Woodlands by 2:30 p.m. and got back to the house last night
about 8:30 p.m. That has been a pretty typical day when in Houston, and this
morning I was up at 4:00 a.m. to catch the first flight into Austin.
Thankfully, the hard work and long hours are paying off. I have closed 3 or 4
deals now on my own and am further along then they expected me to be at this
point, so I will be in Houston on a more full-time basis in the next couple of
weeks. I will be in Houston on my own all next week ( July 4th week). By the
end of July I should only be in Austin on Monday's, as a day trip, and then in
Houston the rest of the week. I have not yet purchased my airline tickets for
the fishing trip, but I will look to do it this weekend.

Good to hear you are doing well at work.

If you need to get in touch with me, here are all my numbers.

Houston office 713-968-9222
Austin office  512-329-0050 or 800-664-4888
mobile #       281-723-3991
e-mail address bwachsler@cm-ic.com or bwax@ghg.net

Talk to you soon,

Brian






> Haven't talked to you in a while.  I don't have any of your numbers and

Hello!

As you know (all too well!), your job does not offer you all of the 
flexibility that you might like.  In an effort to give you a little more free 
time, we will start with the following plan.

What's a late day and who gets them?
Each book calc'er will sign up for a  one late day a month.  A late day is 
defined as a  one in which you do not come into the office until 3 p.m.   

When can I have one?
The late days to sign up for include any day Monday-Friday (excluding bid 
week thru 2nd workday).  Only one person can be out with a late day each 
day.  

Who's my back-up?
When you enjoy your late day, your back-up as defined below is responsible 
for your activities until 3 p.m.  If the following back-up schedule needs to 
change, let's make that quickly.  If you need additional security access to 
back-up someone, then put that request in immediately.  Each of the back-ups 
should "swap" jobs for a few days (until 3 p.m. to practice your 
responsibilities).  

If the back-up plan is successful, then we can potentially expand our 
creative work schedule possibilities.  We must prove that it will work, 
however, before can take any more steps.

When do we start?
All regions will implement in June. . .Irena will coordinate the calendar 
next week.

Let me know what you think!
Carrie

signature to complete your Quicksilver enrollment.  Please hand this
signature form to the designated Alamo representative.

   You will receive your Quicksilver card within 1-2
weeks.  However, you may also use the credit card(s) listed in your Master
Rental Agreement Profile to access the Quicksilver kiosk.  All rentals
initiated with the Quicksilver card will be billed to the first credit card
listed; rentals initiated with the pre-registered credit card will be billed
to that credit card.

   Thank you for visiting our Web site and enrolling in
Alamo's Quicksilver service.

Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.

You can renew your drivers license online!!  It only costs $25, which is $1
more than going to DPS and standing in line!!  So when you need to renew, go
to www.dps.texasonline.state.tx.us.  Mine was two days expired and I was
still able to renew online.

We are pleased to present you with a 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Award.  As a participant in this grant you have the opportunity to share in the ownership of Enron and the potential profit from increases in the value of Enron's common stock.

The 2001 Special Stock Option Grant was made to let you know how valuable you are and to recognize your contributions in making Enron the great company it is today.   Although there are no guarantees as to Enron's future stock performance, we believe that an Enron stock option has tremendous future growth potential.  The value you ultimately receive from your options will depend on the price of Enron stock at the time you exercise your options.  

You can access your 2001 Special Stock Option Grant Agreement and the Stock Plan document governing the grant via your eHRonline account on the intranet website at http://ehronline.enron.com.  Unlike stock options granted in the past a copy of your grant agreement will not be mailed to your home address.  

Additionally, the following information regarding the 2001 Special Stock Option Grant can be found on the HR website http://hrweb.enron.com.

?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Highlights
?	2001 Special Stock Option Grant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
?	A "How to Exercise Options" document that contains contact information and PaineWebber forms applicable to your stock options

Please take time to review this material.  It is important to us and to you.  If you have any questions, please contact your Human Resources representative.

Hi Everybody,
It is hard to believe but our 10 year reunion is fast approaching. I am
trying to organize everything I would like to get a good address on all of
you. The reunion will be September 23rd at the Clear Lake Hilton.  The first
mailout about the reunion is expected to go out in May. I am trying to verify
some address information before then.  If you could email me back with your
correct address, phone number and email address (I assume I have the right
one) that would help.  Next week we will be launching our Clear Lake High
School class of 1990 reunion web page.  You will be able to find out updates
on the reunion and see who is coming and get lots of additional information
on the website.  At least, that is the plan as of today.  If you can spread
the work about the website it would be appreciated.  The address will be
www.clhs90.com.

I will send out more information as I put it together.  If anyone needs to
get a hold of me you can reach me at this email address or my home number
(703) 532-8881.  I hope everyone is doing well and I look forward to seeing
everyone in September.  If you have additional addresses of fellow classmates
you can send me that would be very helpful.

Subject: RE: What are you talking about $1600?


I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding
EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person
that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would
suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest
bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to
confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your
payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than
some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid
$60 will respond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to
intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up,
but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

   Subject: What are you talking about $1600?


   I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid
   at
   $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am
   sorry if
   you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these
   balls
   were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
   higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an
   adjustment,
   but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
   planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If
   not,
   I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
   possible.  Thanks.

I made a Paypal payment this morning.  All the shipping information on the

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Invitations will be going out this week.


We need your photos!  Open the attachment or check it out online to find out
more...
http://www.clhs90.com/release4.pdf


The following is the plain text version of the attached file
-------------------------------------------------------------

SEND US YOUR PHOTOS!
http://www.clhs90.com

"Memories...all alone in the moonlight..."

Remember that song? Well, now your moonlit memories can be forever captured
in cyberspace. (Well at least for a while anyway!)  We're putting together
an electronic "scrapbook" for our website, and we need your help to make it
truly representative of our class.

So how can you help?  Well, we'd would love it if you would send us five to
fifteen pictures to help us get it up and running.  When you send us your
photos, we'll group them by theme (e.g. "football" or "drama") or by your
name.  If you want, you can even write a few lines explaining each photo.
To see what the scrapbook section will look like,  please visit:
http://www.clhs90.com/scrapbook/

Basically, we think it would be boring if all the pictures in the scrapbook
were of us.  So, please, please, please send us your pictures!  C'mon. It'll
be fun!

If you want your photo memories up on the web, you have a few options.

1.  Mail them to Geneen Pipher-Boyd at 4519 71st Street #1909; Lubbock,
Texas 79424.  She'll scan them and mail them back to you within 48 hours.
2.  Send them via e-mail either as gifs or jpegs  (check for acceptability
of other file formats) to csgp@ttuhsc.edu.

Question: How do I get my photos in electronic format?
Answers:  Use a digital camera to take your pictures. Scan traditional
photos.  This can be done with your own scanner or at a print shop like
Kinko's (most locations offer scanning services for a nominal fee). Finally,
many drugstores now offer to put your photos on a CD-ROM when you take your
film in for processing.

3.  Or, if you're in the Houston area, you can arrange a photo swap with
Kathy (Voigt) Nuernberg. You can arrange this by contacting Kathy at
kathy@nuernberg-online.com .

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at
$6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry if
you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these balls
were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment,
but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not,
I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
possible.  Thanks.

Phillip,

I think I told you that my boss, LTC Dowling, has decided to retire from the
Army.  He is real interested in moving to Houston.  He has family there.  A
guy he knows (who apparently works for Enron, but I'm not sure) suggested he
try there for a job.  while we were travelling together last week, we were
at Applebys, eating dinner and watching the Astro's.  I mentioned that mys
son's company paid a bunch of money for that stadium.  When Ed heard that,
he asked if you might take a resume in for him.  I kind of volunteered you.
Then I got to thinking, I think I remember you saying that you get some kind
of reward if they hire someone you recommend.

In my opinion, and you know I have those, any company that gets this guy has
found a gold mine.

If it's a problem, I'll understand.  But if it's possible, I'd really
appreciate you taking a copy of this to Enron.  And, by the way, I told Ed
several weeks ago, before I knew he was retiring, that if and when he needed
my help, call me and I'd come work for him again.  So, who knows, if he gets
on in Houston, I might get an opportunity to move there too.

Thanks,

Pop

P.S.  Don't forget, I'll be out of town most of the week.

Phillip, I rejected your security request because you already had access to 
Sitara.  I just modified your existing security profile by removing your 
access to the East and granting you access to the Central desk.  In order for 
the change to be effective, you will need to get completely out of all open 
Sitara applications and get back in.  If you have any questions, please call 
me at x35423.
