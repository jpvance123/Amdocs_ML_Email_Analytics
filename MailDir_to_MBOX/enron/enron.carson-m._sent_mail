How is Heather feeling. I have a 20% off coupon for Babies R Us. I was
looking on the gifts listed in Heather's registry with them. Is there
anything in particular, that you don't already have, that you need. This
coupon is burning a hole in my pocket.

Dear Abby,
I am a sailor in the United States Coast Guard. My parents live in the suburb 
of
Philadelphia and one of my sisters, who lives in Bensonhurst is married to a
transvestite. My Father and Mother have recently been arrested for growing and
selling marijuana and are currently dependent on my other two sisters, who are
prostitutes in Jersey City. I have two brothers, one who is currently serving 
a
non-parole life sentence in Attica, for the rape & murder of a teenage boy in
1994, the other currently being held in the Wellington Remand Center on 
charges
of incest with his three children.
I have recently become engaged to marry a former Thai prostitute who lives in
the Bronx and indeed is still a part-time "working girl" in a brothel, 
however,
her time there is limited as she has recently been infected with an STD.  We
intend to marry as soon as possible and are currently looking into the
possibility of opening our own brothel, with my fiancee utilizing her 
knowledge
of the industry working as the manager.  I am hoping my two sisters would be
interested in joining our team.  Although I would prefer them not to 
prostitute
themselves, at least it would get them off the streets and, hopefully, the
heroin.
I love my fiancee and look forward to bringing her into the family, and of
course I want to be totally honest with her.  This is my dilemma:  Should I 
tell
her about my cousin who graduated from RICE University?

Signed, Worried about my reputation

 <A HREF="http://www.radio-stations.net/index.php3">Click here: Radio
stations from around the world</A>

This is a good site to quickly find worldwide radio stations on the
internet....can sort any way first by continent then by news, talk, type of
music etc.   Can be very interesting to "tune in" to say a world hot spot
when something is happening.  I go to KOMA and Bob Brinker and Guam from
here.   For instance, there was some news on a possible military takeover on
the island of Fiji this morning...i went to a Fiji news station.

Subject: Ribfest, Saturday, Nov. 4 - the day of Reckoning

As the chaplain said in Caddyshack, "The good Lord would never ruin the=20
greatest game of my life", and Mr. Murray, "I don't think the heavy stuff i=
s=20
coming down for quite some time yet."

Hopefully the weather-guys didn't flip the coin correctly this time=20
(weather.com says, "isolated T-storms, 81H, 66L).  Rain or shine though, th=
e=20
ribfest will go on.



RIBFEST IV

Mike Paradise produced an unparalleled performance last year managing to=20
dominate the lowest ranking of all the contestants by a considerable margin=
=20
for the second year in a row!  Additionally, the judges showed tremendous=
=20
wisdom picking the winner.  However, the nagging question remains; how good=
=20
does the perfect rib taste?  Thus, as the artist must pursue beauty, the=20
fourth annual celebration of the Baby Back Rib must take place.
=20
This event involves many of the things you need for a perfect weekend day:=
=20
eating a lot of ribs, imbibing libations, enjoying an autumn day, and=20
watching some football.  This year, the contestants will be cooking an absu=
rd=20
amount of ribs, allowing the crowd to voice their opinion on the "people's=
=20
choice" along with the official judging of the champion.  Cooking technique=
s=20
are hotly debated, and the insults are legion, but within a month, most=20
people are able to speak to each other again.
=20
If you think you=01,re going to make it please call Greg or Martha (713)=20
861-2766, we need to know how much to stock up on.  Kids are definitely=20
welcome, we are renting an inflatable moon-walk, and we'll have someone the=

to help watch the kids.

Details:

Date: Saturday, Nov 4, 2000

Time:  We start the grills around 12:00, the first judging will occur aroun=

3:30.  Most people don't have the emotional wherewithal (myself especially)=
=20
to make it much past 7:30.

Where:  1443 N. Oxford Street (in the Heights)=20

 From I10=20
 If you are coming from the West and driving East, exit at Studemont.  Take=

RIBFEST IV

Mike Paradise produced an unparalleled performance last year managing to=20
dominate the lowest ranking of all the contestants by a considerable margin=
=20
for the second year in a row!  Additionally, the judges showed tremendous=
=20
wisdom picking the winner.  However, the nagging question remains; how good=

does the perfect rib taste?  Thus, as the artist must pursue beauty, the=20
fourth annual celebration of the Baby Back Rib must take place.
=20
This event involves many of the things you need for a perfect weekend day:=
=20
eating a lot of ribs, imbibing libations, enjoying an autumn day, and=20
watching some football.  This year, the contestants will be cooking an absu=
rd=20
amount of ribs, allowing the crowd to voice their opinion on the "people's=

Could you look in the paper and see what Lone Star Ford has for an AD for a
2000 Expedition Eddie Bauer v8 4.6 -- they were running about 30,800 there
which may be better than I can do here

Life is all about a "Six pack and a Sun-tan!"

Mike
Are you there today??? I need to close the loop with you on directions to
the Pentagon City -- repeat "Pentagon City" Metro station / shopping mall...
Chuck and I agree, this is the best place to head to and park the car (6
story parking garage -- about 1/2 mile from pentagon).   From there -- take
the metro over to the "Pentagon Station" which is the pentagon....
