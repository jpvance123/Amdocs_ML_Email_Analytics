I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,
Scott

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

thanks.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.

Take all American women who are within five years of menopause - train us for a few weeks, outfit us with automatic weapons, grenades, gas masks, moisturizer with SPF15, Prozac, hormones, chocolate, and canned tuna - drop us (parachuted, preferably) across the landscape of Afghanistan, and let us do what comes naturally.
Think about it. Our anger quotient alone, even when doing standard stuff like grocery shopping and paying bills, is formidable enough to make even armed men in turbans tremble.
We've had our children, we would gladly suffer or die to protect them and their future. We'd like to get away from our husbands, if they haven't left already. And for those of us who are single, the prospect of finding a good man with whom to share life is about as likely as being struck by lightning.  We have nothing to lose. We've survived the water diet, the protein diet, the carbohydrate diet, and the grapefruit diet in gyms and saunas across America and never lost a pound. We can easily survive months in the hostile terrain of Afghanistan with no food at all!
We've spent years tracking down our husbands or lovers in bars, hardware stores, or sporting events...finding bin Laden in some cave will be no problem.
Uniting all the warring tribes of Afghanistan in a new government? Oh, please ... we've planned the seating arrangements for in-laws and extended families at Thanksgiving dinners for years ... we understand tribal warfare.
Between us, we've divorced enough husbands to know every trick there is for how they hide, launder, or cover up bank accounts and money sources. We know how to find that money and we know how to seize it ... with or without the government's help!
Let us go and fight. The Taliban hates women. Imagine their terror as we crawl like ants with hot-flashes over their godforsaken terrain. I'm going to write my Congresswoman. You should, too!

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Tom-
If you look at the email string below you will notice that I started trying to solve this imbalence on April 3.  3 days later Tammy sent me an email telling me the exact thing I had tried to start with.  CMS suggested to Tammy to roll the 16,000 into April.  I sent to Tammy the email you see below on April 6 that we do not have anything sold to ENA in April and that our next deal runs from May through January 2002.  Since  I assumed there would be a small discrepancy between the amount ENA schedules and the amount CMS delivers every month, it seemed logical to try to total it all out at the end.  I do not know how the gas industry works.  I don't know if this over delivery is normal for a pipeline and is as close as you can expect to get or whether ENA simply over scheduled.  I did not agree to anything with CMS, but simply put out a proposal to ENA which was never responded to, even after several follow up emails.  I am still awaiting a response to this idea.

Subject:	RE: Gas at Trunkline Lake Charles

It appears that the 16,000 was extra gas that the terminal overdelivered.  The imbalance is between the terminal and trunkline.  Dan Masters has agreed to take all these imbalances and net them in january 2002.  ENA has no responsibility for this gas and will not allow it to be put on our agreements.  This will only create an imbalance we will be cashed out on.  In January 2002  the price we settle up at will need to be decided at that time.

The sendout for that April 16 delivery on the "Hoegh Galleon" begins on May
1, then is ratable through January 31, 2002 on the rest (5 more) of the
"Hoegh Galleon" cargoes.  I would be in favor of settling up at the end of
January for all 6 cargoes since we'll have overage/underage every month.
Let me know what you think.
Dan

Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance.

Tammy-
Following up on the email below, I show that between the two cargoes we
delivered, Enron LNG Marketing will be billing Enron North America for a
total of 5,759,994 MMBtu on our various contracts.  CMS Trunkline delivered
5,776,300 MMBtu of gas through the pipeline, or 16,306 MMBtu excess. This
16,306 MMBtu is to be handled directly between Trunkline and Enron North
America.
Please let me know if you disagree with any of these figures.
Dan

Subject:  Gas at Trunkline Lake Charles

Tammy-
I never heard back from Jim O'leary at Trunkline, but just to make sure we
are on the same page I wanted to confirm our quantities for this month.

>From the "LNG Jamal" you should get 3,104,896 MMBtu total in March.  Please
have the contract for the last 51,396 MMBtu faxed to me at 713-646-6560.

>From the "Matthew" you should get 2,720,000 MMBtu total in March.  This
number is approximate and will change to an exact number after arrival of
the "Matthew" around Mar 10, however I undertand the gas will be delivered
starting March 1 from Trunkline.

After we get the exact figure from the discharge of the "Matthew" I will
send out another email to show the total amount you will receive from us in
March.  Any quantities over or under this amount should be reconciled
between Enron North America and Trunkline.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

Bryant and Tom--

Term deal #VC3697 (Sitara deal #'s 1064276, 1064290, and 1064301) were all originally executed with Alcoa, Inc. on 5/25/01.  Subsequently, these deal was approved by Credit because the deal fit under Alcoa's credit profile.  This deal was recently moved to PACE  Global Energy Services, LLC.  Credit has not been approved for PACE, nor do we have any financial information on PACE.  As a matter of fact, the little information that we have for PACE is not positive at all.

No new deals should be executed with PACE Global Energy Services, LLC until credit has reviewed and assessed a credit line, etc.

I have asked Deal Validation to have these deals moved back to where they were originally booked to (Alcoa, Inc.).  If you have any questions or any information on PACE, you can give me a call at x6-6002.


Thanks,

Veronica Espinoza

Tom:
I talked with Mary this a.m. and I don't understand why she is making this out to be so difficult but she didn't understand what we need re: Panaco.  I told her that Milton Bolanos ( Volume Mgmt) has the downloaded pipeline statements which show the daily cashout over the past year for each block on Hios and Larry Aguirre Has ANR.  All she has to do is apply the cashout price for each month and spit out the totals and add them together to see the net effect over the year and do the same for yr. 2001.   I asked her to get back to me with an ETA.   The Devon 2000 $$  are still not put into your book, this is the email that she forwarded to me.  I asked her to update you directly.  This is the message from her.

I have a meeting with Philip Love and Kam Kaiser Wed. 6/6/01 at 9:am
	1. How do they want to book in Sitara.
	2. Calculations of Panaco (Jan-March 01) complete. Using your "Hios Imbalance" graph Jan-Mar 01 had the biggest 	swing. I need to meet with the principles to discuss.
	4. It will be the end of the week before Devon 2001 penalties are complete. I'll be doing system testing this afternoon.

I hate to be a pest but, Tom really needs to get some answers re:

1.  Status of the Devon $$ for year 2000 that I think you were working with Philip Love in Risk Mgmt.  Did it get moved into ENA Central Gulf?
2.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2000.
3.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2001.
4.  The Devon penalties and cashout for 2001.

Free Opera in the Park featuring Houston Grand Opera's Carmen, June 8-10!
Houston Grand Opera's sensational Multimedia Modular Stage production returns for three FREE performances at Houston's Miller Outdoor Theatre on June 8-10 at 8:30 p.m. Bizet's fiery gypsy Carmen, everybody's favorite femme fatale, ignites the summer in a powerhouse production that had audiences and critics cheering when it was first unveiled in 1998.

Houston Grand Opera's revolutionary Multimedia Modular Stage (MMS), with its giant "live" video screens, hydraulic platforms, and hundreds of rotating, colored lights takes the incredible energy onstage and transports it to the farthest reaches of the outdoor venue with a visceral impact equal to that of a rock concert!

Tickets for the reserved seating will be issued between the hours of 11:30am and 1:00pm through the Miller Theatre box office on the day of the performance.  Any remaining tickets will be issued one hour before the performance.

Yes, I will be calling Martin and Kevin today.
I think it's best to keep it as close to the vest as possible.  I don't want
to upset anyone
and certainly all are being considered.  The next time anyone asks anything,
please
feel free to suggest to them that they call me directly.

Thanks a lot.

you going to call them and discuss what is going on?  I am not sure what

'On-line Exchanges Evolve'

Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

Backhaul to west                      40

Amber Station is flowing 323 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 129 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

Power plants burned at 140 Mdth/d and are nominated at similar levels for
today.  Arkla is only burning around 170 Mdth/d but is expected to pick up
with the cold front coming in over the service area tomorrow.

Gas Prices     East  $2.78
          West  $2.71

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.04476/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.  REGT will be
posting available November Firm Transportation capacity sometime today.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

supportive environment where you can explore the "process" of creativity and risk-taking completely free from the 
barriers of comparison, evaluation, judgment, success, failure or awards.  The only prerequisite is a spirit of inquiry.  

The Enron Mind's Eye Motorcade
Friday, April 27th - 9:00am to 1:00pm and 1:00pm to 4:00pm 
The Enron Mind's Eye Motorcade is an art car convoy sponsored by Enron.  It will visit Enron-designated stops 
in the community including our adopted schools, non-profit organizations and medical center 
facilities dedicated to treating children.   Enron employees are needed to accompany the convoy and interact with 
the community by communicating the importance of innovation.   When registering, please designate your time preference.

There are no registration fees for any of these activities and space is limited.

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

The Delhi Compressor unit is now forecasted to come back sometime on
Friday.  I will let you know of any changes.  REGT has one storage field
(Koch Bistineau) and MRT has another field done for testing.  Storage
injection space remains tight today and will be through the end of the
week.

Amber Station is flowing 330 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 102 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 87 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly lower levels for today.  Arkla has been burning from 250 to 300
Mdth/d and peaking over 500 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  $2.60
          West  $2.535

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.03546/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks

The Delhi Compressor unit in NE Louisiana in the Perryville Hub complex
cracked a discharge bottle last Friday.  This limits our ability to
compress into CGT and REGT will be limited on deliveries into CGT.  For
Wednesday, CGT deliveries will be cut to the 250 Mdth/d level.  The cuts
will be pro-rata based on nominations.  The bottle will take at least 1 to
2 weeks to repair.   It looks like it will be into next week before the
compressor is fully operational.

Amber Station is flowing 361 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 109 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 148 Mdth/d level.  Arkla pulled over 345
Mdth/d and peaked at 680 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  n/a
          West  n/a

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on $3.05
= $0.0495/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

The sendout for that April 16 delivery on the "Hoegh Galleon" begins on May
1, then is ratable through January 31, 2002 on the rest (5 more) of the
"Hoegh Galleon" cargoes.  I would be in favor of settling up at the end of
January for all 6 cargoes since we'll have overage/underage every month.
Let me know what you think.
Dan

Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance.

Here is a spreadsheet showing your ending balance as of 3/31/01.

Tammy-
Following up on the email below, I show that between the two cargoes we
delivered, Enron LNG Marketing will be billing Enron North America for a
total of 5,759,994 MMBtu on our various contracts.  CMS Trunkline delivered
5,776,300 MMBtu of gas through the pipeline, or 16,306 MMBtu excess. This
16,306 MMBtu is to be handled directly between Trunkline and Enron North
America.
Please let me know if you disagree with any of these figures.
Dan

Tammy-
I never heard back from Jim O'leary at Trunkline, but just to make sure we
are on the same page I wanted to confirm our quantities for this month.

>From the "LNG Jamal" you should get 3,104,896 MMBtu total in March.  Please
have the contract for the last 51,396 MMBtu faxed to me at 713-646-6560.

>From the "Matthew" you should get 2,720,000 MMBtu total in March.  This
number is approximate and will change to an exact number after arrival of
the "Matthew" around Mar 10, however I undertand the gas will be delivered
starting March 1 from Trunkline.

After we get the exact figure from the discharge of the "Matthew" I will
send out another email to show the total amount you will receive from us in
March.  Any quantities over or under this amount should be reconciled
between Enron North America and Trunkline.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

Since I never heard back from you I assume this is agreeable to you as well.  Please respond one way or the other so we can get the books closed.

The sendout for that April 16 delivery on the "Hoegh Galleon" begins on May
1, then is ratable through January 31, 2002 on the rest (5 more) of the
"Hoegh Galleon" cargoes.  I would be in favor of settling up at the end of
January for all 6 cargoes since we'll have overage/underage every month.
Let me know what you think.
Dan

Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance.

Tammy-
Following up on the email below, I show that between the two cargoes we
delivered, Enron LNG Marketing will be billing Enron North America for a
total of 5,759,994 MMBtu on our various contracts.  CMS Trunkline delivered
5,776,300 MMBtu of gas through the pipeline, or 16,306 MMBtu excess. This
16,306 MMBtu is to be handled directly between Trunkline and Enron North
America.
Please let me know if you disagree with any of these figures.
Dan

Subject:  Gas at Trunkline Lake Charles

Tammy-
I never heard back from Jim O'leary at Trunkline, but just to make sure we
are on the same page I wanted to confirm our quantities for this month.

>From the "LNG Jamal" you should get 3,104,896 MMBtu total in March.  Please
have the contract for the last 51,396 MMBtu faxed to me at 713-646-6560.

>From the "Matthew" you should get 2,720,000 MMBtu total in March.  This
number is approximate and will change to an exact number after arrival of
the "Matthew" around Mar 10, however I undertand the gas will be delivered
starting March 1 from Trunkline.

After we get the exact figure from the discharge of the "Matthew" I will
send out another email to show the total amount you will receive from us in
March.  Any quantities over or under this amount should be reconciled
between Enron North America and Trunkline.

Thanks and regards,
Dan Masters

IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

Subject: REGT Capacity Report Thursday November 8


For gas flow for Friday November 9,  REGT has the following IT capacity:

for Friday
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       10           TETCO pressures up, may
have temporary lost a station this morning
Texas Gas Helena                      90
MRT Glendale                          20
Other Line AC points                        20

SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

REGT has the #1 unit at Malvern down for repair, the Delhi Compressor unit
looks to be out until late Friday and the Bistineau storage field is shut
in for bottom hole testing through Friday.   Storage injection space
remains tight today and will be through the end of the week.

Amber Station is flowing 338 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 98 Mdth for
today.  Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible
transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All
IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT
is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma
storage facilities.

Power plants burned around the 100 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly lower levels for today.  Arkla has been burning from 250 to 300
Mdth/d and peaking over 500 Mdth.    Arkla is forecasted to increase
slightly for Friday as a weak cold front moves across the area but quickly
return to warmer than normal levels through the weekend.

Gas Prices     East  $2.605
          West  $2.545

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0355/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Tom,
I was talking to Tony Honings with Central Illinois Light this morning about doing some trades on EOL.  He said he calls you to do some of his physical deals and said he just likes talking to the traders.  He did say he needed to start doing some online trades.  He's close so next time you talk to him, see if you can give him a shove.
Thanks.
Bill

Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, "Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company."

S&P also said, "[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales."

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

Tom and Sean,

I have confirmed with Valerie Curtis, the ENA settlements coordinator for Duke Field Services, that deal # 1027152 belongs to Duke Field Services.  Valerie has been in touch with her counterpart at Duke and they are expecting to be billed for this gas; she can confirm this information or provide further detail from Duke if needed.

Upon your confirmation of this, please change the CP name on this deal.

Thank you,
Scott

I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Here is what Trunkline sent us as what was over scheduled (it's from Lotus Notes so I had to copy and paste):


"Trunkline just called me to tell me that we received 16,595 mmbtu too much
from LNG in the month of March.   There is another ship due to come in on
April 16th.   Trunkline has suggested that we take 16,595 less then what we
are expecting, in order to make up for the March imbalance."

Thanks,
Dan

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our "Ode to Why" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the "Leading Company in the World."

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Subject: SBS/PALS Cycling Capacity


REGT is posting today its ability to offer discounted SBS/PALS rates for
deals starting in April 2002 for one year terms or longer.

REGT estimates that there could be as much as 2.0 Bcf available for SBS
cycling deals on a year-around basis starting in April 2002.
The daily deliverability associated with this volume will vary by deal but
is roughly based on:

               injection 3500 dth per every 100,000 dth capacity
               withdrawal     4000 dth per every 100,000 dth capacity

SBS/PALS is an interruptible service and REGT cannot guarantee its
availability everyday.  REGT is offering to enter into rates pertaining to
this capacity for a long term period should it become available.

REGT would be interested in entertaining a variety of deal structures or
proposals, including the traditional reservation/commodity setup.  Rates
may be posted as negotiated rate structures.

Written  requests  for possible discounted rates should be received by REGT
by  the  end of the business day on December 7, 2001.  You can email or fax
them into me at 713-207-9628 or jfogg@reliantenergy.com.

Please  contact  me  at  713-207-5183  concerning  additional  questions or
inquiries.

Thanks

Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.  BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.  This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the "BEARing Gifts" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.  Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.  BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.

Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.  For more information, contact Margaret Doucette at (713) 345-7892 or Janette Elbertson at (713) 853-7906.  

Thank you very much for your support.

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways.

However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

I'll put your changes in but have you had a chance to look at the May imbalance?  Enron is short by over 40,000mm on HIOS alone.

Tom,
Currently, voluntary severence is not used in North America.  If that changes, I will let you know.  Thank you.

Jeanie,

In light of the layoffs that are coming on Monday, if HR is looking for people to layoff, is it  possible to volunteer for the severence package.

Please call if you have any questions.

Enron Global LNG
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.

All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

Hello All -- Attached is a memo highlighting the issue areas covered by staff at the ICC meeting in Chicago yesterday.  If you have any questions feel free to call.  It was strange to hear Tom Kennedy say that staff supports reasonable hedging practices and forward contract purchases while sitting next to Zuraski who opposed recovery of same in the PGLC fixed price docket.  Incidentally, Tom Kennedy noted several times that hedging will not necessarily reduce prices but will stabilize them.

Tom or Phillip,

Deal #537939 (Dec-00 purchase from Shell Western E&P) is being invoiced from Coral Energy Resources.  I assume that since this the only deal in the system for that month with SWEPI, Coral is correct.  Therefore, please review / change this deal from SWEPI to Coral Energy Resources, L.P.  Please let me know of any questions or when this change is complete.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier

I believe Jeff Bartlet will be seeking your approval to the standstill provision in the above agreement.  I just wanted to make sure that you are aware that Enron Corp. as an affiliate of ENA would be bound by the provision, since (i) it will have access to the confidential information or (ii) if it takes any of the actions prohibited by paragraph 5 of that letter at the direction of ENA.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Hello

Thanks for the quick response, if you wish to pay via visa I personally 
can't process your card you would need to either open an account with 
www.paypal.com or www.bidpay.com  -both of them take about a minute to set 
up, but please note paypal is a free service while bidpay charges (but is 
easier to use).

All prices are in US dollars. Please e-mail me your shipping address for 
faster order processing, and include your e-mail address or auction info 
with your payment to avoid processing delays.

Item of purchase : NANCY DREW COMPLETE 54 HARDCOVER BOOK SET NEW
Price : $165.00
Surface shipping (5-10 days) : $30.00  - For faster shipping options see below
Total : $195.00

- For Insurance ADD $2.00 - (if nothing arrives I will send another one no 
hassles)
- For airmail shipping ADD $10.00  - (4-5 days delivery time on average)
- For express shipping ADD $20.00  - (2-4 days guaranteed with tracking and 
is insured)

Payment options:

(1) Pay by credit card: through www.paypal.com (see end of e-mail for more 
info) or  www.bidpay.com and the item will be shipped out as soon as 
possible - note: paypal is a free service while bidpay is not
(2) Pay by money order: Upon receipt of the money order I will ship the 
item out asap.

Please send you payments and make payable to:

Ms. Liz Olsen
22773 Reid Avenue
Maple Ridge, B.C.
V2X 4G7
Canada
*PLEASE remember it costs 60 cents (not 34) cents to send a letter to Canada


Paying with Paypal:

If you do not have a paypal account you will need to open one here is the 
link: https://secure.paypal.com/refer/pal=onservice@telus.net

Just click on the "sign up" button on the top right corner. Please enter 
your information about your self. Paypal is the most popular online payment 
service available, and most auction sellers accept it. I also recommend 
paypal because you can pay via credit card or bank account (takes a while 
with a bank account) and they do not process your credit card on-line as 
most web sites do, thus your information is not stored on the internet and 
not readily available to hackers.

If you have a paypal account or have just finished signing up go to 
www.paypal.com and sign in. Then click "send money" at the top of the main 
page. On the next screen you need to enter info about the auction, my 
e-mail address is onservice@telus.net and my last name is Olsen. If you 
wish the item to be shipped somewhere besides your billing address please 
make that clear under the section where you can leave a note.

It takes about 30 seconds to send money via paypal, and when you have 
finished sending it paypal will send me an e-mail, upon receipt of 
confirmation of payment being received I will ship the item asap.

Visit my webpage at www.INNERHORIZON.com for other great deals on
books, movies and computer games!

  Thank you

"If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking."  - George S. Patton, Jr.
 
Keeping with our Mind's Eye Madness week, be sure to check out the Enron Mind's Eye Motorcade 
on Friday, April 27th from 11:30am to 1:00pm at the Big E Cafe.  This art car convoy will spend the day visiting 
Enron-designated stops in the community to promote innovation and creativity.  Mirroring Enron's innovation, 
these artists think about the way things could be and are not limited by the way things are.

Featuring:
Lunch by Escalantes Mexican Grille - choice of beef, chicken or veggie fajitas with trimmings, dessert and a drink for $5.  
Live salsa music will be provided by Tropicrew, featuring Enron's own Ms. Alex Villarreal as the lead singer.  
Non-profit organizations represented will include the March of Dimes, SEARCH and the Lupus Foundation of America.  
Get lunch free if you're dressed "freaky"!
  
Word of the Day
Zeitgeist \TSYT-guyst; ZYT-guyst\, noun:  The spirit of the time; the general intellectual & moral state or temper characteristic of any period of time.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Subject: REGT Capacity Report Monday November 5


For gas flow for Tuesday, November 6,  REGT has the following IT capacity:
Please note my paragraph at the bottom today.

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for Tuesday
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       10
Texas Gas Helena                      90

Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                     0
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The Delhi Compressor unit may be back on line in a day or two.

Amber Station is flowing 334 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 98 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 75 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly higher levels for today.  I have not seen Arkla stats for the
weekend yet.

Gas Prices     East  $2.78
          West  $2.71

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.0374/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.

Power plants burned 111 Mdth on Monday and noms are down to 75 Mdth.
Arkla loads are about 10% above normal (400 Mdth/d) for Wednesday but are
forecasted to drop back to about 1/3 warmer than normal for the weekend.

          West  $2.370

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0338/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at

Hello All--

Shelley Corman has asked me to forward the attached letter to you regarding Enron's fundraising efforts on behalf of the March of Dimes.  

Please take a moment to review--any contribution you can make would be greatly appreciated and will be matched 100% by Enron.

Please ket me know if you have any questions or need any additional information

Thanks!
  
Please make checks payable to the March of Dimes and send to me at Location EB3275F. 
 
==========================================================================================================================
Dear ENA Team Member:
 
I am proud to serve as a sponsor of Enron's March of Dimes 2001 Walk Team.   March of Dimes is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to improve the health of babies preventing birth defects and infant mortality.  Childhood health is a cause near and dear to my heart.   
 
Obviously, it is a cause that is near and dear to Enron employees as well.  Last year our Enron team raised over $46,000.   This year our team has set a goal to raise $75,000.  With your help, I believe we can achieve this aggressive goal. 
 
I understand that you are called upon to donate your time and money to many worthy causes and clearly I am not a seasoned fundraiser.  What I can tell you is that I am proud of our employees that have rallied a grassroots effort to support March of Dimes here at Enron.  I am committed to continuing their work.  I ask that you consider making a donation in any amount.  

Please use the attached envelope to make your donation to the March of Dimes and forward you check back to me by Friday, April 27th.  Your contribution is totally tax deductible and Enron will match your gift dollar for dollar (I will take care of the matching paperwork).  
 
Thanks, in advance, for your donation and support of the March of Dimes.  You can read more about the March of Dimes at www.modimes.org.  
 
Sincerely,

Suzanne Calcagno

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

thanks.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Tom,

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

Charlene: 
When you called this morning you told me there were changes for the first of May not the 28th of this month.   I  can't make changes now.   You'll have to have the operator reallocate the gas if you want to make up to Enron.  I can't cut any markets at this point for the weekend.

The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Natural Gas Futures Up Slightly on Short-Covering=20




    Natural gas for October delivery on the NYMEX ended the day up $0.015 t=
o $1.915 as the market awaits the AGA storage data due out today. The Novem=
ber contract gained $0.025 to $2.30 per MMBtu. The market managed to recove=
r partially from Monday's sell-off in active pre expiration trading. Much o=
f the gain was due to a late session short-covering rally, and short term t=
raders expect a nominally higher open today. The locals are still wanting t=
o push prices lower to a target of $1.80. There is just a negative bias to =
natural gas, as well as all the energies right now. There is just no demand=
, and the long term weather forecasts are not promising. The October contra=
ct expires today and has lost 25% over the past 6 sessions. NYMEX continues=
 to hold abbreviated floor trading sessions this week. The natural gas open=
 outcry sessions runs from 10:30 AM to 1:45 PM EDT, except today when the c=
lose will be extended until 2:45 PM to allow trading after the release of A=
GA storage data about 2:00 PM. Look for and an injection of  70 - 80 Bcf to=
 be reported for last week. A year ago inventories rose 77 Bcf, and on aver=
age over the last 5 years, stocks have gained about 72 Bcf this week. Total=
 inventories of 2.757 Tcf are 432 Bcf, or 19% higher than a year ago, and 2=
48 Bcf above the 5-year average. NOAA expects 25 CDDs for this week, which =
would be 7 below normal and 9 below a year ago, and could mean another larg=
e build in next week's AGA report relative to the year-ago figure, particul=
arly with spreads to winter still encouraging injections. However, storage =
is about 87% full and will soon begin filling up. The latest National Weath=
er Service forecast for early next month calls for below normal weather alo=
ng the East Coast, extending into East Texas, and above normal from eastern=
 California into the upper Plains. Natural gas for next day delivery across=
 the US and Canada was generally flat to down $0.05 per MMBtu yesterday. Na=
tural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub dipped $0.05 to a new 22-m=

FERC ALJ Postpones California Deadline



    A FERC ALJ has postponed until March 8th the deadline for issuing a rep=
ort on whether California is entitled to refunds of $9 billion for wholesal=
e power purchases when prices soared in the past year. The judge abandoned =
his earlier plan to issue a final report in November. The report's recommen=
dations will be considered by FERC commissioners for any further action. La=
st July, the commissioners ordered a 45-day mediation period for California=
 and the power suppliers to negotiate a compromise. But the clock will not =
start ticking for that 45-day period on December 7th, when all evidence has=
 been submitted by the California ISO and the California PX, the judge said=
. He extended the deadline for finishing the case after agreeing to give th=
e California ISO, and the now-defunct California PX more time to analyze ma=
rket prices during the disputed refund period. The extension is needed by t=
he California ISO to use a sophisticated computer model to analyze and calc=
ulate wholesale power prices from October 2000 through January 2001.=20

Devon, Mitchell Deal Questionable




   The recent drop in Devon Energy's share price could place an obstacle in=
 the path of its planned acquisition of Mitchell Energy. Last month, Devon =
agreed to acquire Mitchell for $31 per share in cash and 0.585 of its own s=
hares for each Mitchell share, in a deal then valued at about $3.1 billion.=
 The companies agreed that the deal should be tax-free for Mitchell stockho=
lders. But, to qualify for tax-free status, the cash component cannot excee=
d 60% of the total offer. Yesterday, Devon's stock fell $0.17 to $32.93 per=
 share, down from about $50 just before the Mitchell deal was struck. Mitch=
ell's shares were also down yesterday, dipping $1.88 to $47.07, while Devon=
's offer for Mitchell was worth $50.26 per share, with the cash component n=
ow making up about 62% of the value. Both companies remain committed to the=
 deal, but realize that it could face problems unless Devon's stock price i=
ncreases by the 4th quarter when the deal is expected to close.=20

FERC ALJ Recommends Denial of Pacific Northwest  Power Refunds
 =20
    A FERC Administrative Law Judge has recommended that the full commissio=
n deny the $1.9 billion in refunds requested by Pacific Northwest municipal=
 utilities and wholesale electricity buyers for power purchases last spring=
 when prices jumped sharply higher. The ALJ pointed out that the Pacific No=
rthwest market is very different than the California market, because Califo=
rnia state law prohibited utilities from passing higher power costs on to c=
ustomers, while the market worked properly in the Pacific Northwest when su=
pplies were tight. The Northwestern states rely heavily on hydroelectric po=
wer and suffered a draught situation which coincided with a shortage of ele=
ctricity supplies throughout the Western US. The ALJ contends that the Paci=
fic Northwest experienced a sudden and acute drop in available supply, and =
in that situation prices rose dramatically, as should be normal. Of the tot=
al $1.9 billion sought in refunds, California has laid claim to almost $1.5=
 billion. =20

Governor Expected to Order Lawmakers Back=20




    In attempt to prevent the bankruptcy of Southern California Edison, the=
 governor is poised to order lawmakers to return to Sacramento, after they =
adjourned last week without voting on a rescue plan for the utility. The go=
vernor is in the process of developing a proposal and is consulting with st=
ate senators and Assembly members to find an acceptable compromise between =
the two legislative houses. The new plan will probably allow SCE to sell be=
tween $2.5 and $2.9 billion in bonds which would be secured by existing cha=
rges to about 20% of its biggest commercial consumers. California's Senate =
has approved a version of the bill, voting for $2.5 billion in bond sales, =
but secured by the rates of 4,000 of SCE's largest customers. In addition, =
the state would have the option to purchase the utility's transmission line=
s at book value. SCE argues that the plan would not prevent its bankruptcy.=
 The Assembly version increased the bond sale to $2.9 billion and spread th=
e costs over 136,000 business customers. In addition, the lawmakers gave th=
e state the option to buy the transmission grid at double the book value or=
 at market value, whichever is less, and a provision to reinstate the retai=
l power market. However, when the Senate received the amended bill, it decl=
ined to vote on the measure, adjourning for the year instead. The governor =
is expected to limit the topics under discussion by the legislature when th=
ey return, in order to prevent lawmakers from discussing bills unrelated to=
 the rescue plan.

I have nominated 16,646mm at 368 on the 10th and taken it to 1mm per Charlene on the 11th. As of the 12th, I took it to "0".   Our trader, Tom Donohoe,  has told me that since you have a force majure there as of the 12th. we can not take the well to 1 and it will be at "0" till you are flowing gas to us again.  If you have gas that flows onto the system we will discuss buying it from you later in the month.   Please have your  marketer  call Tom Donohoe if you need to discuss this at 713-853-7151.

Mark-  HIOS just called and asked that Enron nom a 1 for HI 351/368 beginning May 10 instead of 0.  The reason for this is that their system needs this to allocate correctly.  Please advise if you have any questions at 405-228-4298.  Thanks!

Welcome back.   Hope everyone had a good and safe Thanksgiving.  For gas
flow for Tuesday,November 27, REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0          CGT back on line at 326
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       15           TETCO pressures have
been up and down, limiting IT.
Texas Gas Helena                      85
MRT Glendale                          15
Other Line AC points                        15
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                   75
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      50

REGT is still having problems with several compressors including Malvern
#1, Ada, Round Mountain and Chandler stations.   Amber Station is flowing
295 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 99 Mdth for today.  Be aware that REGT
is not offering any general interruptible transportation discounts from
West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate,
unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD
and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.

Power plants only burned about 30 to 35 Mdth/d over the past few days.  I
have not seen any Arkla report for the weekend but the weather was mild.
Look for a pickup  with the colder weather hitting the system through
Wednesday but it may be just a quick hitting front

Gas Prices     East  $1.70
          West  $1.615

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0237/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks

As you are aware, there have recently been a number of virus attacks released and spread across the Internet. Although Enron continually readdresses and updates its virus protection procedures, new viruses will continue to be released and pose a threat to Enron's computing environment. Therefore, it is very important that all Enron employees understand their responsibilities in helping Enron stay virus free. 
If you receive a file via Email or any other means and you are unfamiliar with the sender or the purpose of the file, please do not automatically open/launch the file. One of the key elements of a virus attack is the innocent nature of its delivery.
Viruses can cause a significant amount of damage, including data loss and service outage. Viruses such as the Melissa, ILOVEYOU, AnnaKournikova, and the recent Nimda virus, caused organizations billions of dollars. Sometimes new viruses can breach the environment before the virus scanning software has been updated to detect & quarantine them. 
Every employee in the Enron organization has a responsibility to keep our computing environment virus-free.
If you believe you have a file that looks suspicious, delete it or contact your Resolution Center to obtain their assistance.

For gas flow for the Weekend Saturday November 10 through Monday November
12,  REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for the weekend, estimated return 11/15 now
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                         0          TETCO pressures up,
trouble getting full nominations into them

SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The factory is taking longer than hoped for on fixing the suction bottles
and the latest estimate of the return of the Delhi compressor is next
Friday.  Volumes are being held at 250,000 dth at CGT at this time.  Also,
REGT has the #1 unit at Malvern down for repair.  Storage injection space
remains tight due to two tests being run on REGT today and tomorrow.  The
Bistineau storage field is shut in for bottom hole testing and Chiles Dome
undergoes its annual 4 point withdrawal test tomorrow.

Amber Station is flowing 353 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 111 Mdth for
today.  Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible
transportation discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All
IT will be priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT
is still full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma
storage facilities.

Power plants burned around the 100 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly lower levels for today.  Arkla has been burning less than 200
Mdth/d but is forecasted to increase slightly for Saturday as a weak cold
front moves across the area but quickly return to warmer than normal levels
on Sunday and into next week.

Gas Prices     East  $2.595
          West  $2.535

 REGT Fuel - currently 1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0354/dth

Tom or Phillip,

Deal #537939 (Dec-00 purchase from Shell Western E&P) is being invoiced from Coral Energy Resources.  I assume that since this the only deal in the system for that month with SWEPI, Coral is correct.  Therefore, please review / change this deal from SWEPI to Coral Energy Resources, L.P.  Please let me know of any questions or when this change is complete.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier

Natural Gas Futures End Flat=20




Natural gas futures for November delivery on the NYMEX went nowhere yesterd=
ay, failing to break above $2.30 per MMBtu and settling at $2.253 per MMBtu=
, unchanged from Wednesday. Trading was thin as many traders were out of th=
e ring for a religous holiday. On the positive side, the first month of the=
 winter strip's support held at $2.21 per MMBtu and did not gravitate towar=
d the October futures expiration or physical prices, as volatility has abso=
lutely fled the market. The December contract lost $0.009 to $2.624 per MMB=
tu, trading within a narrow $0.075 range. So attention remains fixed on the=
 $0.42 differential between the October expiration and the November contrac=
t. With $2.21 setting up to be a pivotal support level, a breakdown below $=
2.20 could be deemed a failure. If the market sees no strength today ahead =
of a low-demand weekend, expect another sell-off ahead of what happened las=
t Monday when the October contract sold down $0.20 to 30-month lows. Extrem=
ely bearish fundamentals remain in place, from weather, to storage, to lack=
 of industrial load and hurricanes. So look for the November contract to tr=
ade downward in the next few days in an effort to resolve that high spread.=
 However, trading for today into the weekend remains a tough call as the ma=
rket has not shown a willingness to go anywhere lately. Next week, the NYME=
X extends energy trading from 10 AM to 2 PM EDT, except for Wednesday, whic=
h will trade 10 AM to 2:30 PM to accommodate trading after the AGA storage =
report. The latest NWS forecast for next week calls for below normal weathe=
r for the Eastern half of the US, from Texas into the Northeast, and above =
normal in most of the West. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US=
 was generally flat to $0.05 lower yesterday. Canadian spot prices were up =
$0.05 $0.10 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub d=
ipped $0.01 to $1.89 per MMBtu.=20

Reliant Acquires Orion=20




Reliant Resources will buy Orion Power Holdings for about $2.9 billion in c=

W to 25,100 MW, either currently in operation or under construction. Orion =
operates primarily in New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. The move will provid=
e Reliant with some strategically placed assets in the transmission-challen=
ged New York City market. Reliant will pay $26.80 per share for Orion, whic=
h is about a 40% premium based on its current NYSE price of $19.20 and woul=
d assume $1.8 billion of Orion's debt. The purchase will be paid for by cas=
h on hand, $400 million of current credit and a new bridge loan of $1.6 - $=
1.8 billion. The acquisition would give Reliant a $7.7 billion market capit=
alization. With deregulation and growing demand for power, it is estimated =
that at least 180,000 MW of generation capacity will be needed in the US by=
 2002. The onset of the retail power market resulted in 16% of the nation's=
 generation capacity changing hands, and the other 84% may change ownership=
 over the next 10 years.

Former Trinity CEO Pleads Guilty




Sidney Sers, Trinity Gas former chief executive, has pled guilty to money l=
aundering and obstruction of justice charges and could face life in prison =
and a $15 million fine. Sers admits to transferring $800,000 made in violat=
ion of 1997 and 1998 court orders. The charges stem from a SEC probe of Ser=
s and Trinity. Both were charged with bilking investors out of millions of =
dollars by issuing a number of false and misleading statements intended to =
boost the company's shares, allowing officers to sell stock at inflated pri=
ces. A sentencing date has not yet been set. Sers transferred Trinity share=

Exelon Lowers 3rd Quarter Earnings Forecast=20




Exelon said 3rd quarter profit will be about 25% below forecasts due to low=
er demand for electricity. With the downturn in the nations economy, electr=
icity usage by manufacturers has dropped, and with milder temperatures than=
 expected, air conditioning use slumped during the summer. Exelon was forme=
d when Peco Energy merged with Unicom. The company's ComEd and Peco Energy =
utilities have about 5 million electricity customers in northern Illinois a=
nd southeastern Pennsylvania. Peco also sells natural gas to 425,000 custom=
ers in the Philadelphia area. Since Exelon has few plants that burn natural=
 gas, it has not been able to take advantage of falling prices. Exelon expe=
cts to earn $1.10 to $1.20 per share, lowered from predictions of $1.35 to =
$1.80 per share. Analysts had forecast a profit of $1.57. Exelon stock fell=
 $5.95 to $44.50, dropping about $1.9 billion from its market value. Its sh=
ares have dropped 37% this year.=20

Williston Basin Plans New Pipeline



Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline plans to file for FERC approval to buil=
d 245 miles of 16-inch natural gas pipeline across parts Wyoming, Montana a=
nd North Dakota. The pipeline, expected to begin north of Gillette, Wyoming=
 and end south of Killdeer, North Dakota, initially would be capable of tra=
nsporting from 80 - 120 MMcf per day. Additional transportation capacity co=
uld be added incrementally as natural gas production grows. Initially, the =
pipeline is expected to have 3 large compressor stations - one on the south=
 end of the route in Wyoming, another in eastern Montana and the third in N=
orth Dakota. Additional transportation capacity through the pipeline can be=
 made available by adding more compression facilities. The pipeline would t=
ransport volumes from developing coal-bed and conventional natural gas prod=
uction in central Wyoming and south central Montana to interconnecting pipe=
lines that will transport it to large Midwestern markets. The selection of =
the pipeline's route is nearly complete and initial surveying work has begu=
n. After FERC approval, construction could begin in third quarter of 2002, =
with transportation service slated to begin in late 2002.=20

Gulf of Mexico Natural Gas Volumes Declining



The Gulf of Mexico will remain an important source for natural gas, but is =
unlikely to meet projected soaring demand in the next few years. Since the =
mid-1980s the focus has shifted increasingly to deeper waters which yield m=
ore oil than natural gas. While the shallow water of the continental shelf =
contain twice as much natural gas as oil, that is reversed in water depths =
of 1,000 feet or more. The National Petroleum Council forecasts annual dema=
nd will rise to 29 Tcf by 2010 from about 23 Tcf now. According to the MMS,=
 natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has fallen steadily from a pe=
ak of 5.14 Tcf in 1997 to 4.9 Tcf in 2000. During that period ,deepwater na=
tural gas production actually rose to 980 Bcf from 380 Bcf, but not enough =
to offset the larger drop in shallow water production. The MMS forecasts a =
wide range of possibilities for the future, with total Gulf of Mexico outpu=
t possibly falling up to 16% by 2005 or rising as high as 24%. In an effort=
 to increase production, the MMS has introduced royalty relief for companie=
s that drill very deep wells in the shallow waters. Although the shallow wa=
ters have been thoroughly explored, very few wells have been drilled to 15,=
000 feet or deeper. The MMS estimates there could be up to 20 Tcf of recove=
rable reserves of deep wells. The Rocky Mountain region and Canada represen=
t the best opportunities to increase natural gas supplies, possibly sustain=
ing annual demand of 24 Tcf. But much of the estimated 177 Tcf in the Rocki=
es is off-limits to drilling.=20

For gas flow for Thursday, November 1,  REGT has the following IT capacity:
Please note my paragraph at the bottom today.

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for Thursday, same as before
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       30
Texas Gas Helena                      75
MRT Glendale                          20
Other Line AC points                        20
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                   10           warmer weather expected
on system, limits injections
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The Delhi Compressor unit in NE Louisiana in the Perryville Hub complex
cracked a discharge bottle last Friday.  This limits our ability to
compress into CGT and REGT will be limited on deliveries into CGT.  For
Wednesday, CGT deliveries will be cut to the 250 Mdth/d level.  The cuts
will be pro-rata based on nominations.  The bottle will take at least 1 to
2 weeks to repair.   It looks like it will be into next week before the
compressor is fully operational.

Amber Station is flowing 345 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 109 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 100 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly higher levels for today.  Arkla pulled over 380 Mdth/d and peaked
at 650 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  $2.995
          West  $2.925

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.0406/dth, almost a penny
drop in fuel costs.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.  I will be out of the office for
the next two days at the SGA Gas Transportation Roundtable in San Antonio,
Texas.  There will not be a morning capacity email for the next two days.
If you need information or a rate quote, you can call Marie Downing at
713-207-5194.  I will be somewhat available to Marie and will be checking
in with her from time to time.

Thanks

JAF

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Subject: REGT Capacity Report Oct 16


For gas flow for Wednesday October 17, REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10          Ruston Compressor
work cuts back on IT
Tetco Bald Knob                       20
Texas Gas Helena                      30
MRT Glendale                          10
Other Line AC points                        10
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     15
SBS injection space                   20           tomorrow in Dec out
SBS withdrawal space                        50          available for
withdrawal with Oct or longer payback
Backhaul to west                      50

Amber Station is flowing 368 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 133 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage faciltiies.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

MRT is taking its Unionville Storage field out of service for a couple of
days for maintainance.  During this time, REGT will be working with MRT to
balance service.  This will limit REGT storage space over the next few
days.

Power plants burned at 125 Mdth/d yesterday and are nominated similar for
today.

Gas Prices     East  $2.125
          West  $2.020

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0346/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.  I will be traveling to the REGT
Shreveport office this afternoon and will be working out of Shreveport for
tomorrow.  I will let you know the telephone up in Shreveport in tomorrow's
email.

Thanks

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

For gas flow for Friday October 12, REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     30
Tetco Bald Knob                       70           everything moving at

capacity available, also possible December withdrawals
SBS withdrawal space                        75          available for
withdrawal with Oct or longer payback
Backhaul to west                      50

Amber Station is flowing 377 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 115 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discount from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage faciltiies.  Compressor
maintenance along REGT's mainlines also continues at this time.

Power plants burned at 163 Mdth/d yesterday and are nominated at lower
levels for today.     Arkla has been taking about 190 Mdth/d but this may
increase slightly for tomorrow with the cold fronts moving through the
region.

Gas Prices     East  $2.075
          West  $1.98

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0338/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks

	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of "zeros" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to "business as usual."   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the "International Travel" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin the week of October 15th.
Two schedules are being offered:
	Course # 7129-00:  Tuesdays, Oct 16 - Dec 11 (no class Nov 20)
	Course # 7129-01:  Thursdays, Oct 18 - Dec 13 (no class Nov 22)
PLEASE NOTE that the two schedules are not interchangeable; employees should
enroll in their preferred schedule and stick to that schedule.

Course details:
	- Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron employees
	- Each course is limited to eight students
	- Meets once a week for eight weeks
	- Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
		include initial exam)
	- Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
	- Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
	- Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
		GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
	- Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition
Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
	1.  Print out the attached registration form.
	2.  Complete the form, but please note the following 
		SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
		A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
			your email address.
		B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
			me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________", 
			please indicate either course #7129-00 (Tuesdays) or # 7129-01 (Thursdays).  
If you wish, you may indicate one course as your first choice and the other as your second choice.
		C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
			tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.  
			FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is required on the registration form.

The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be honored.  
Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on awaiting list for the course or courses indicated.
Enrollments and waitlists will be confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
The next courses at the Princeton Review office start the week of October 20.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or for future schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

FERC Wants to Increase Industry Monitoring





    The new chairman of the FERC wants to increase the Commission's ability=
 to monitor energy sales in order to prevent abuses rather than just react =
to complaints. The commission has asked Congress to approve over $1.3 milli=
on for the addition of 10 senior level officials to monitor energy sales an=
d actively look for market abuses. The agency currently has 50 people assig=
ned to enforcement. The chairman says that even though the market has been =
moving towards deregulation for 10 years, the commission has not adjusted i=
ts examinations. The FERC is asking Congress to give it more authority to i=
mpose fines of up to $10,000 per violation, per day. Violators could lose t=
he ability to base rates on market prices and be forced to charge only appr=
oved rates. The Electric Power Supply Association says members aren't afrai=
d of additional market monitoring so long as it doesn't cross the line into=
 political interventions every time there is a market fluctuation. High pri=
ces don't necessarily mean markets aren't working and can provide signals t=
he market needs more power supply or a demand response.=20

     Six Midwest power companies have applied with the FERC to form a new e=
ntity to merge their electric transmission systems. The new transmission co=
mpany will be called Translink Transmission. It will be a for-profit compan=
y set up as part of FERC's 1999 order that investor-owned utilities join a =
RTO by the end of this year. The FERC has made RTOs a top priority since th=
e California power crisis.  RTOs establish common rules that allow utilitie=
s to smoothly trade bulk power across the borders of their own local transm=
ission systems. Applicants for Translink Transmission consist of IES Utilit=
ies and Iowa and Interstate Power; Iowa's Corn Belt Power Cooperative; MidA=
merican Energy; Nebraska Public Power District; Omaha Public Power District=
; and Xcel Energy. The utilities will participate in Translink through a co=
mbination of divestiture, leases and operating agreements.  Translink will =
manage 26,000 miles of transmission lines and about 35,500 MW to about 6.9 =
million utility customers in 14 states. It expects to be in business by the=
 end of next year. The new transmission company will also contract with the=
 Midwest ISO for RTO services.  Separately, a Canada's Manitoba Hydro has j=
oined Midwest ISO. The agreement is the first international extension of a =
US based ISO. Manitoba Hydro has 5,200 MW of mostly hydroelectric power gen=
eration and provides energy to all of Manitoba except central Winnipeg. The=
 coordination agreement allows the utility to participate in the ISO withou=
t violating Canadian law, which prevents Manitoba Hydro from signing the Mi=
dwest ISO's transmission owners' agreement. Manitoba and the Midwest ISO ar=
e both part of Mid-Continent Area Power Pool.=20

California Generators Want Payment Plan=20



    Five large power generators have contacted Southern California Edison i=
n an attempt to find out how much, when and if they will be paid for electr=
icity sold to the utility. Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron and Puget Sound E=
nergy say they have received little assurance that the SCE intends to work =
out a payment plan with its creditors if the California legislature fails t=
o pass a rescue plan. State senators adjourned last month without approving=
 a $2.9 billion rescue package. The governor has called special session lat=
er this month to consider a bail-out, however it is unlikely the lawmakers =
will pass the measure in its present form. The current version of the plan =
does not allow SCE to use bonds sold under the measure to pay the generator=
s. Since SCE supported that version of the plan, the generators want to kno=
w how they will be paid. An attorney for the companies says they want a sim=
ple yes or no to whether or not SCE is interested in negotiating a forbeara=
nce agreement. The generators contend that SCE can take steps to ensure tha=
t all creditor classes are treated equally, and payments can be made from e=
xisting funds or from a sale of secured bonds.=20

I'm not sure if you are planning to do any deals on Reliant Field Services for Dec 1 but I wanted to let you know that Field Services called me this morning to tell me that our invoices have not been paid and if they weren't paid by the end of the week, we would not be able to nominate on their system for Dec 1.   I passed her call on to Mark McClure, who is the supervisor in Volume Management.   I will keep you posted with any new information that I receive but wanted to let you know of this problem before you purchased any gas to be transported on their system.

I am working out of the Shreveport office this morning till approximately
9:30.  Please call me at 318-429-3832 for any IT rates for tomorrow.  AOL
IM is also up at JAFOGG

For gas flow for Thursday October 18, REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10          Ruston Compressor
work cuts back on IT
Tetco Bald Knob                       50
Texas Gas Helena                      50
MRT Glendale                          10
Other Line AC points                        10
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     15
SBS injection space                   50           tomorrow in Dec out
SBS withdrawal space                        50          available for
withdrawal with Oct or longer payback
Backhaul to west                      50

Amber Station is flowing 353 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 121 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage faciltiies.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

MRT is taking its Unionville Storage field out of service for a couple of
days for maintainance.  During this time, REGT will be working with MRT to
balance service.  This will limit REGT storage space over the next few days
and may also limit IT at particular points.

Arkla is pulling over 300 Mdth with the cooler weather and peaked at over
600 Mdth/hr rate.  I do not have the power report.

Gas Prices     East  $2.375
          West  $2.290

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0386/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.

I will be back in the Houston office on Thursday.

Thanks

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets 
In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001. The product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an unplanned power generation outage.

The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its generation risk for summer 2001. This risk is associated with a forced outage of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand. The transaction, which was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits of cooperation between business units within Enron. GRM is working with a number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.  For additional information on the product, please call David Hoog in the New York office at 212 702 3920.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Travel Tip of the Week:  Book non-refundable tickets. Airlines typically allow unused non-refundable tickets to be applied towards subsequent travel. Even if you need to make a change at a rate of $100, in many cases the change fee plus the ticket price is still less than a refundable ticket.
	For example:  Houston to Washington, D.C.
	     Refundable:		$ 1,447
	     Non-refundable      	$    540

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

"To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling." --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Reminder:  Brown Bag Lunch, Thursday, May 17 at 11:30 AM in 5 C2. The speaker is Michael L. Miller discussing Principal Investments.

"Historically, Newsprint has been sold under strong relationships as a highly differentiated, branded product to "very discriminating" buyers at newspaper publishers. EIM believed differently.  By the end of March, EIM had succeeded in closing on its 2nd Newsprint mill, making it the 7th largest Newsprint manufacturer in North America.  Remarkably, in just 2 months, EIM's Newsprint team has succeeded in closing $100MM total notional value "Enron commodity style" fixed price contracts with terms of 1 to 5 years?..and they said it wasn't a commodity."
Rodney Malcolm - Vice President, Forest Products Sales and Marketing

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron closes major coal deal in Germany
After almost six months of negotiations, Enron's coal team has signed a contract with Stadtwerke Bremen to supply this major German municipality with coal until 2006. Under the deal structure, Enron will deliver a total of 4.6 million tonnes of coal - equivalent to an overall contract volume of almost $200 million  (DM 440 million).

The agreement represents Enron's first significant long-term coal supply deal in Germany. The annual contractual volume amounts to around 3% of total German coal imports and provides us with continuous volume flow in Northern Germany, enabling us to grow our position in the market.

Parallel to this deal, Enron also entered into a separate agreement with HMS Bergbau Agentur, a company specialising in Polish exports. Under this agreement, HMS will be the handling agent and a potential supplier of Polish coal to us over the lifetime of the contract.

Congratulations to the whole team involved: Sven Becker, Manfred Ungethum, Cornelia Luptowitsch, Peter Bradley, Jez Peters and Michael Schuh.

Tom or Phillip,

Deal #537939 (Dec-00 purchase from Shell Western E&P) is being invoiced from Coral Energy Resources.  I assume that since this the only deal in the system for that month with SWEPI, Coral is correct.  Therefore, please review / change this deal from SWEPI to Coral Energy Resources, L.P.  Please let me know of any questions or when this change is complete.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Natural Gas Futures Continue Downward Spiral




    Natural gas for November delivery on the NYMEX continued decline yester=
day, dropping $0.036 to $2.208 after hitting a new contract low of $2.14. T=
he December contract dipped $0.02 to $2.602 per MMBtu. Prices opened sharpl=
y lower, but managed to stage an erratic rally to finish near the highs of =
the day. The mild weather and diminishing storage availability continue to =
pressure a weak cash market which in turns is dragging down futures prices.=
 As storage becomes less available more expensive, the differential between=
 cash and futures could continue to widen. Early injection estimates for to=
morrows weekly AGA storage report range between 75 Bcf to 85 Bcf. For the s=
ame week last year, stocks rose 78 Bcf, and on average over the last 5 year=
s, stocks have gained about 70 Bcf. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad=
ministration reports last week's tally of 39 Heating Degree Days was 11 abo=
ve normal, but 5 less than forecast and 5 below the same week a year ago. N=
OAA said it expected 44 HDDs this week, or 6 above normal. In terms of cool=
ing degree days, NOAA said last week's tally of 18 was 13 less than the pre=
vious week, 7 below normal and 2 less than the same week a year ago. NOAA h=
as forecast 13 CDDs this week, which is 6 below normal. The latest NWS fore=
cast calls for normal temperatures for most of the nation, except for parts=
 of the Midwest, Northeast and South Texas which will be below normal. Manu=
facturing activity, which consumes about 45% of all natural gas use, contra=
cted for a 14th straight month in September but showed signs of improvement=
. The National Association of Purchasing Management monthly index dipped on=
ly slightly in September, slipping to 47.0 in its worst slump since the 199=
0-1991 recession. A reading under 50 indicates that manufacturing activity,=
 about one-sixth of the overall economy, is declining. The NAPM index has n=
ow held below that level since August 2000, but has been steadily improving=
 from January's 10-year low of 41.2. Natural gas for next day delivery acro=
ss the US and Canada was generally off $0.05 $0.10 yesterday. Natural gas f=
or next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.05 to $1.77 per MMBtu.

Restart of Dabhol Power Project Proposed



    A panel established by the Indian state of Maharashtra has suggested th=
at if all parties involved are willing to absorb the costs, the 2,184 MW Da=
bhol power project could be re-started. The panel suggested that if all the=
 shareholders were willing to absorb the costs, the tariff on Dabhol's powe=
r could be reduced. The panel has also proposed that Enron, GE and Bechtel =
absorb a huge loss on their investment in the project. After a acrimonious =
dispute with the local utility, Enron had said it would like to abandon the=
 project. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board, which had initially cont=
racted to purchase all the power from Dabhol plant, subsequently defaulted =
on payments because it didn't need that much power and claimed it was too e=
xpensive. Enron claimed the utility was in violation of its contractual obl=
igations. Dabhol took the dispute to the International Court of Arbitration=
 in London, but Enron has said it would settle out of court if it could rec=
over its costs.=20

Congress to Hold Hearing on Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline




    Congress plans to consider a multi-billion dollar pipeline project to t=
ransport natural gas from Alaska today. A consortium of oil companies last =
week released a gloomy report on the project's economics. BP, Phillips Petr=
oleum and Exxon Mobil unveiled a preliminary study on the project last week=
 that showed smaller investment returns than previously estimated. The proj=
ect is uneconomical at this point, but despite the study the project has no=
t been shelved. The consortium will likely make a decision on the project b=
y the and of the year. Depending on the route, it may cost between $15 bill=
ion and $17 billion. The 2000-mile southern route parallels the TAPS to Fai=
rbanks, then turns to follow the Alaska Highway through the Yukon Territory=
 and British Columbia, connecting with existing pipelines in Alberta. The 1=
,650-mile northern route runs east from the North Slope to the Mackenzie Ri=
ver delta, then south along the Mackenzie valley into Alberta. It would be =
cheaper, but would have to cross the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. The S=
enate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will hold a hearing today o=
n legislation that may be needed to move pipeline construction forward. The=
 hearing will  focus on ways the federal government can help improve projec=
t economics. The consortium has requested fast-track approval of FERC permi=
ts, but no direct federal subsidies for construction costs. The Bush admini=
stration says the project must be independently feasible and not rely on su=
bsidies. Natural gas from Alaska could make up 10% of nations energy suppli=
es by 2015, according to a study from the Interstate Natural Gas Supply Ass=
ociation of America.=20

California Has a Plan in Case Bond Sale Delayed




    Californias controller says that the state is on solid economic ground =
and is not facing a fiscal emergency, even if a proposed bond sale is postp=
oned. The state is attempting to issue $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the =
general fund for $6.1 billion spent on buying power for Pacific Gas & Elect=
ric and Southern California Edison. The bond sale is being held up because =
state regulators have not approved the designation of a portion of the util=
ities rates to repay the bonds. Last month, the state sold $5.7 billion in =
revenue anticipation notes to boost the general fund and provide a buffer u=
ntil the bonds can be sold. Since revenue anticipation notes must be repaid=
 by the end of the fiscal year, California could issue revenue anticipation=
 warrants to repay the notes if the bonds are not issued before. The state =
treasurer has warned that the states budget deficit could rise to $9.3 bill=
ion by the beginning of fiscal year 2003 if the bonds are not issued by the=
n and state lawmakers would have to consider raising taxes or cutting spend=
ing. =20

REGT had an upset on its system yesterday.  The following alert has been 
posted:

The #2 unit at Chandler Station near Wilburton, Oklahoma has gone down for 
unscheduled repairs.  Estimated duration of downtime is ten to
twelve days.  Day trading IT capacity will be limited in the Quadrangle, Line 
AC, and Perryville Hub. Further IT and secondary firm
reductions in these same areas may be required at some point in time. REGT 
will provide as much advance notification as possible of further
reductions should it become necessary.

With a big unit at Malvern Compressor Station also down at this time, IT 
space is limited for tomorrow.

Power plants are still in the 100-125 range.  Arkla takes are expected up on 
Wednesday due to a fast cold front moving through the area but it will not 
have a major lasting impact beyond a day or two.

I am out of the office today and am sending this from home.  Marie Downing 
will be covering for any rate quotes.  You can reach Marie at 713-207-5194.  
I will be back in the office tomorrow.

Thanks

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

Sylvia, NGPL sent a letter to your attention dated 11/5/01 to notify you
that this contract is up for renewal (expires 6/2/2002) and Enron needs to
notify us by 12/5/01 if it wants to go thru the right-of-first-refusal

This morning a revised letter was faxed in error which stated that the
notification date is now 12/31/01.

PLEASE DISREGARD THIS FAX!

I called and spoke with Lindsey Culotta since you are out today but I wanted
to make sure you got the word that you should disregard this fax and stick

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Scott, 

Could you please move the following deals from Tom Donohoe's desk to the Upstream desk for June forward and enter corresponding desk to desk tickets?  However, on the gas daily desk to desk, can we please aggregate all the volumes and enter just one desk to desk at the ANR pool?  If you have any questions regarding this please feel free to ask either myself, George or Charlie.  It would be great, if you could get this done before tomorrow.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets
Washington, DC -- The Society of the Plastics Industry Inc. (SPI), the trade association representing one of the largest manufacturing industries in the United States, announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with Enron Global Markets LLC (EGM), to jointly promote price risk management financial products that will help plastics processors in managing financial risks associated with resin price volatility.

Through this agreement, SPI members will have direct access to EGM's experience in the plastics industry and to the financial products the company currently offers to the market. In addition, SPI and EGM will offer special seminars uniquely tailored to the needs of the SPI membership on effectively managing price risk. As part of Enron's partnership with SPI, we will conduct a series of industry-specific risk management seminars.  

Companies in the plastics industry today face a number of challenges such as rising costs in raw material and energy, and economic factors beyond their control including slow demand.  Financial products being offered by EGM can, for example, fix or establish a maximum resin price for a given period of time, thereby allowing the companies to make better business decisions and improve financial stability.

EWS Business Analysis and Reporting
Enron Wholesale Services (excluding Net Works) has nearly 1350 invoices totaling almost $12 million waiting for coding and approval in the iPayit system.  Over 900 invoices have been in the system greater than 30 days.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, each of us needs to do our part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors. 

Following are the statistics on invoices in the system greater than 30 days:

ENA	443 invoices totaling $4.3 million
EBS	358 invoices totaling $4.6 million
EGM	 87 invoices totaling $262,000
EIM	 33 invoices totaling $123,000 

If you purchase items that generate invoices (including cell phones, pagers, etc.), or if you are responsible for coding and approving invoices, you will receive an e-mail notification that an invoice has arrived in your iPayit inbox.  You must log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action.  No one else can process the invoice for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox.  

We expect EWS to stay current and process the invoice within 5 days of notification.  We will continue to monitor the status of accounts payable and expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.

If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Christa Winfrey at christa.winfrey@enron.com. 


IN THE NEWS    

Judge Delays California Refund Report Until March 8

Washington, Sept. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The judge who will recommend whether Enron Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and other power sellers owe California as much as $8.9 billion in refunds for electricity sales has postponed his recommendations until March 8.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission administrative judge Bruce Birchman said today that California's grid operator needs more time to collect information about power sales during the October-through-January refund period. This is the second time he postponed his report. Birchman originally said he would make his recommendations to the commission by Nov. 5, then delayed it to Dec. 13.

California demanded the refunds, charging that the power sellers inflated electricity prices. Power providers blame the fourfold increase in the average price of power in California from January to June compared with a year earlier on supply not keeping up with demand.

``I'm not surprised the judge is having trouble finding evidence because I don't think that refunds are due from anybody,'' Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron Commences Authorization Process for New Power Plant in Italy
Enron has begun an application procedure to get the necessary consent to develop a natural gas fired combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power station of up to 1,200MW on a 10-hectare site 1.5km from Roveleto di Cadeo, in the Comune of Cadeo, in the Province of Piacenza (NorthEast Italy).  The following consents must be received before Enron's proposals for a power station can be implemented:

- Decree of Environmental Compatibility from the Ministry of the Environment, 
- Authorization to construct and operate the plant from the Ministry of Industry
- All other necessary local and national permits for construction and operation of the plant, including administrative authorizations and power and gas line connections.

The authorization process is expected to take around two years, such that construction could begin in early 2004, with operation 30-36 months from construction start.  However, the decision to proceed with construction of the project will remain contingent on further developments in the liberalization of the Italian power and gas markets.

 "This is the first time one of our Italian asset development projects has moved forward since our jointly-owned Sarlux IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) plant in Sardinia went into full commercial operation in December 2000," says Ross Sankey who is leading Enron's Cadeo project team.  "We're pleased to have identified such a suitable site for a new power plant and continue to assess other similar opportunities."

GasMarktFax Stirs "Trouble" in German Incumbent-dominated Gas Market
Following on from a recent GlobalFlash! report on the launch of GasMarktFax by the German origination team we are pleased to provide the following update on the impact the product is beginning to have on the German gas market:  

European Spot Gas Markets reported on Thursday, 13 September, that Ruhrgas will decrease prices for their Stadtwerke and regional gas companies as of 1 October.  The article mentions that it is clear that Ruhrgas is taking competition seriously and that last month's release of Enron's GasMarktFax provided Stadtwerke with the opportunity to compare their standard price to Enron offers.  "Pricing pressure pushes incumbents to lower their tariffs," said Helge-Jurgen Beil, director with the German origination team, who lead the GasMarktFax initiative.  "However, it is important to note that incumbents try to crowd out marginal supplies and abuse their dominant supplier position.  Grid access is still cumbersome and only very few customers have a real choice," Helge-Jurgen added.

Enron Signs First Trading Deal in Poland
Enron's Polish team have signed the company's first ever trading deal in the country - which is also the first transaction entered into by a Polish power trading company based on the EFET (European Federation of Energy Traders) Master Trading Agreement.

The 50MW deal is with PKE, currently Poland's largest generator by installed capacity, responsible for around 17% of total energy production in Poland.

The deal with PKE is effectively a series of 51 call options, each one of them being a separate option for 50MW of baseload power for any given calendar month. Enron is the buyer of this series of options. The first month for which Enron will have a call option will be October 2001, and the last will be December 2005. The exercise date for each option is 26 days before the beginning of the delivery month. The strike prices follow a pre-determined schedule.

"This pioneering agreement sets new standards of power trading in Poland," declares Jarek Dybowski, Enron's director of power trading in Poland.

"This deal has set a precedent and created a platform for us to further break into the bilateral wholesale electricity trading market in Poland," adds Jarek Astramowicz, Enron's vice-president and head of the Polish office.  A big thank you to Jarek Dybowski, Tomasz Krzyzewski, Sid Cox, Marcus Zwinger, Pat Cini and Jason Clatworthy and all the others who helped make this deal possible."

EBS Celebrates Neos Deal
Congratulations to EBS who secured a deal with Neos, a company that specialises in providing bandwidth within London and other UK cities (known as metro connectivity). The transaction gives Enron instant access to London's metro network, which expands Enron's coverage. The agreement involves a  ?3 million take or pay commitment over ten years, with Enron receiving fixed prices and degradation for the capacity.
 
Marcello Romano, Vice President Bandwidth Trading, is delighted: "We needed to close a strategic deal to increase our metro coverage. Not only has this been achieved but the team negotiated well below market prices."

Launch of Nordic precipitation index
In another first for Enron, this week saw the launch by Enron Nordic Energy of a precipitation index based on rainfall levels in a number of locations.  The index will serve as a new weather trading instrument bringing more choice to the weather market and thereby promoting market liquidity.  Given the close relationship existing between precipitation levels and power prices in the Nordic region, the index will be of interest to both power traders and large hydro producers.  The index will serve as a new trading instrument enabling power traders to add to and refine their positions.  For the large hydro producers, the index will provide a benchmark for hedging their risk against fluctuations in rainfall.  The index will be based on a large number of locations available throughout the Nordic region, with 27 locations in all (19 in Norway and 8 in Sweden).

On the very day of the index launch, we were able to announce the completion of a deal with Norsk Hydro whereby we have constructed a specific index enabling Norsk Hydro to hedge its production volumes throughout the Nordic region.  

Given the amount of hydroproduction in the Nordic region - approximately 99% (116TWh/yr) in Norway and 50% (64TWh/yr) in Sweden - the index is likely to be of significant interest in the Nordic market.  In Norway and Sweden, about 70% of the supply side is hydro and the volume of this supply can deviate by around 10% from normal (and by up to 30% during extreme years).  The subsequent impact on prices is huge and the variation in produced volumes is of great concern to hydro producers.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: "Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue."
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Tom and Tammy,

	After talking with Dan Masters yesterday, I believe we have the Buy / Sale incorrect in our system.  In Sitarra, the deal (Sale side #672336) was set up for a monthly total of 10,920 (should acutally be 10,902) and was set up for March 16 - 31.  Being that the dates were set as such, a total was calculated for those days only producing a volume of 5,632 to sell back to Enron LNG.  Dan Masters says that the buyback contract was not supposed to be daily and should be for the full monthly amount of 10,902 mmbtu.  He says that they sold us the full contract amount and that they bought back the full 10,902.  Could both of you please look at this and correct the volumes in our system so that I can invoice Enron LNG for the 10,902 mmbtu instead of the 5,632?  Please let me or Dan know if you have any questions.

Tom:  This is the response I got for my request with settlements.....I will let you know what the word is on Monday.  Also, I have requested that she tell me when she can have numbers for this year Devon penalties/Cashout too.  Unfortunately, they act as though we are asking a lot.  They have the data in Excel and it is just a matter of sorting by counterparty and looking at the cashout total by month, then adding them together to see the net effect. I'll let you know asap.

Yes this is a lot of work. The original discussion, I thought,  was to so a sample month or two to see if there was  a trend.
I will work this weekend and see who far I get. I'll let you know Monday morning.

Subject:	Panaco Cashout

I was talking to Tom Donohoe, the Central Gulf trader, today and he said he needs to know the net effect of cashout for all of the past months together in order to determine if we should make waves and force Panaco to pay for Cash Out.  I realize this is a lot of work but, we are running out of time and I just need to get word back to him as to how long it will take.  I don't think it would be a good idea to pick the months that are beneficial to Enron since Panaco will  do the same to us.  Please let me or Lisa Kinsey know what can be done.
Thanks,
Mark

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

Subject:	Start time of ECS Migration

Good day all:

I am working to coordinate the weekend.  If you could tell me the time that we can start taking apart PC's and move.  You will need to speak with your managers and find the times that this will be possible.  The earlier the better, but we need to know a time.  You will need to notify everyone of when it will start so they can leave, if a few have to stay we can work around them, but if anyone needs to be here extremely late we will need to know.

Currently we have people starting from 2:30 to 6PM.


Let me know and thank you for all of the help.

Hi,

	 	The power options trading desk is beginning to structure deals and to make markets in spark spread options ( options on the spreads between power prices and natural gas prices).  Please refer to the attached file for further information.   
	

 	   	It would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals  on the Gas desk  who would be interested in spark spread options.

   	
	 	 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD

It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved (again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at (713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>.

Tom and Sean,

I have confirmed with Valerie Curtis, the ENA settlements coordinator for Duke Field Services, that deal # 1027152 belongs to Duke Field Services.  Valerie has been in touch with her counterpart at Duke and they are expecting to be billed for this gas; she can confirm this information or provide further detail from Duke if needed.

Upon your confirmation of this, please change the CP name on this deal.

Thank you,
Scott

I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,
Scott

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

thanks.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

1. Deal 1025953, we were billed for the total deal volume 1,350, 000MMBtu but we only show receiving 1,347,167MMBtu.(diff of   2833 MMBtu).
2. Deal 778374, we are being billed on the deal volume and not the actual volumes. I could not find the contract in Sitara to verify if we are to be billed on deal volumes and not actuals. How are we to adjust the variances from the deal volumes to the actuals.

Could you please shed some light on these issues or at least guide me to someone who can.

Thanks,

Kay Khan

Kay-
On # 2 below, Jared Kaiser had a deal with someone at ENA (it may have been Tom Donahoe) for the piece you are missing (Sept 1-6).  Please check with Tom to see if it didn't get into the system.

Hi Diane, I have some billing discrepancies

September.

1. Invoice EGK32, Deal 778374, the volume should be 1,103,881MMBtu. I have attached the printscreens from Sitara showing the actual volumes.The sheet is named invegk32.

2. Invoice EGK33, Deal 1025953, Sept 7 - Sept 30, the volume should be 1,077,952MMBtu. I have attached the printscreens from Sitara showing the actual volumes.The sheets are named invegk33a thru d.

July.

1. Invoice EGK25, Deal 778374, the price was NX1+0.01 USD/MMBtu. NX1 for July was 3.182 so the actual price should have been 3.192. You have billed us 3.748. 

Please let me know if these changes can be made and if you can send me corrected invoices.  << File: LNG_Diff_SeptInv01.xls >>

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

thanks.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Tom,

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

For gas flow for Friday October 26, REGT has the following IT capacity:

CGT                                0
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10          Ruston Compressor

Backhaul to west                      40

Amber Station is flowing 330 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 129 Mdth for
today.  REGT has lifted its operational alert limiting West of Amber
receipt capacity in order to give REGT some operational flexibility to
better handle system upsets.  However, be aware that REGT is not offering
any general interruptible transportation discounts from West of Amber to
east delivery points.  All IT will be priced at max rate, unless of
operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still full along Line AD and is
approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage facilities.  REGT is also
undergoing some work at its Ruston compressor station which affects storage
ability and the ability  to transport additional IT into the PVH.

Power plants burned at 155 Mdth/d and are nominated at similar levels for
today.

Gas Prices     East  $2.61
          West  $2.55

REGT Fuel - currently 1.61% plus $0.0004/dth EPC - based on above
= $0.0424/dth.  REGT fuel will drop to 1.31 % on November 1.  I will be
sending out an email on November FT capacity to you later today

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Hey Guys, 
I would like to get together this afternoon around 3:30pm to discuss how we will handle our business during a hurricane.  Issues that we probably need to address are rankings, contracts and possible re-routes and alternative sources of gas.   This should only take about 30minutes. 
Thanks Lisa

A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

Kim,
 
My name is Molly Vaughan and I work along side your Forrester Account Manager David Kobierowski to cover the relationship between Forrester and Enron. I was hoping for an opportunity to have a 10-15 minute conversation with you to find out more about your specific role and business challenges that you may be facing.  Based on that conversation, I will be in a better position to direct you to some of the research we have that addresses those specific topics.  Let me know when a good time for me to call would be.
 
Link to Forrester's homepage  -->  http://www.forrester.com/Home/0,3257,1,FF.html
 
I look forward to working with you,
 
Best regards,
 
Molly Vaughan

Hi, 
	Previously I forwarded an email to you which contain a list of options products we are considering making markets in. 
	Many of you have asked for more details on these (exotic) options products. 
	In response to this request, I will be periodically forwarding modules to your attention which give further details on these options products. 
	Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions, comments, etc.

Tom or Phillip,

Deal #537939 (Dec-00 purchase from Shell Western E&P) is being invoiced from Coral Energy Resources.  I assume that since this the only deal in the system for that month with SWEPI, Coral is correct.  Therefore, please review / change this deal from SWEPI to Coral Energy Resources, L.P.  Please let me know of any questions or when this change is complete.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  

It's that easy!

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like "Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.
Enron Global Technology

In preparation for the upcoming move to Enron Center South we are moving your Home Directories to a new trading cluster.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO:
This will occur for you this EVENING after 6PM.  
We will need to restart your computer in order to complete this action.  
Please log out or your computer by 6PM, if the machine is not logged off we will reboot the machine in order to complete these actions.  
Save your data before going home this evening.
If you have outstanding circumstances that we should address, please reply to this e-mail and we will change our schedule accordingly.



HERE ARE A FEW OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS ACTION:
Newer, more stable environment
More disk space available for common data
Faster network connections



HOW THIS WILL EFFECT YOU:
If you are a laptop user and have to work at home, you should save any work to your 'C:' drive on the laptop.  DO NOT use the "My Documents" folder.  When you return to work and reconnect to the network, any changes made to files/folders in the "My Documents" folder may be deleted from the laptop.
Laptops reconnecting to the network for the first time will receive a synchronization error. 



RESOLUTION:
Please call the Resolution Center (x3-1411) and they will correct the problem ASAP.
We will have additional Technicians available on the floor if the Resolution Center has any problems.

Subject: REGT Capacity Report Tuesday November 6


For gas flow for Wednesday  November 7,  REGT has the following IT
capacity:    Please note my paragraph at the bottom today.

CGT                                0          Capacity cuts to 250 Mdth/d
for Wed
Other Hub Delivery Points including TGT     10
Tetco Bald Knob                       30
Texas Gas Helena                      90
MRT Glendale                          20
Other Line AC points                        20
Williams Jane                         10
Carthage Delivery                     10
SBS injection space                     0
SBS withdrawal space                        50
Backhaul to west                      40

The Delhi Compressor unit is now forecasted to come back sometime on
Friday.  I will let you know of any changes.  REGT has one storage field
(Koch Bistineau) and MRT has another field done for testing.  Storage
injection space remains tight today and will be through the end of the
week.

Amber Station is flowing 335 Mdth east and Line 2 South is at 104 Mdth for
today.

Be aware that REGT is not offering any general interruptible transportation
discounts from West of Amber to east delivery points.  All IT will be
priced at max rate, unless of operational benefit to REGT.  REGT is still
full along Line AD and is approaching full levels at its Oklahoma storage
facilities.

Power plants burned around the 75 Mdth/d level and are nominated at
slightly higher levels for today.  Arkla has been burning from 250 to 300
Mdth/d and peaking over 500 Mdth.

Gas Prices     East  $2.705
          West  $2.63

Remember the lower fuel percentage for November 1.  REGT Fuel - currently
1.31% plus $0.0014/dth EPC - based on above = $0.03677/dth

I am in the office today.  You can call me at 713-207-5183 or AOL IM me at
JAFOGG for any rate quotes or questions.

Thanks

JAF

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

Good Morning,
 
    Tom Donohoe moved his PC this morning and it does not seem to be the correct PC.  I was wondering if maybe there was a move that he did not know about?

Mary:

I hate to be a pest but, Tom really needs to get some answers re:

1.  Status of the Devon $$ for year 2000 that I think you were working with Philip Love in Risk Mgmt.  Did it get moved into ENA Central Gulf?
2.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2000.
3.  The net effect of cashout $$ that Panaco has incurred for year 2001.
4.  The Devon penalties and cashout for 2001.

Mark

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Natural Gas Futures Slip Lower=20
=20
    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX wandered lower  yesterday in uninspire=
d trading as the market consolidated following Wednesday's  surprising high=
 storage injection. Much of the trading was conducted by local  and short-t=
erm traders willing to trade for small gains, compromising price  discovery=
. El Paso and Enron were trying to coax the market up so they could  initia=
te sales. Traders anticipate todays activity to be similar to yesterdays  l=
ackluster pace. The July contract fell $0.011 to $3.79 per MMBtu and August=
  also dipped $0.011 to $3.877 per MMBtu. On Wednesday the AGA reported sto=
rage  levels at 1,398 Bcf, virtually identical to the 5-year average, and 4=
6 Bcf more  than a year ago. After several days of cool, rainy weather, muc=
h of the eastern  half of the nation will have more summer-like weather thi=
s weekend and early  next weeks. Demand use will increase significantly, bu=
t will not be unusually  high for early June. Hot weather in the southweste=
rn states will begin to move  into Texas and the Plains this weekend. Look =
for the market to continue to slip  lower in the absence of any significant=
 driving force. There needs to be  something to change the dynamics of the =
market, but in the meantime, most  everybody is on the same page, and the l=
ocals are simply trying to pick each  other's pockets. The next key level o=
f technical support is $3.60, with $4.00  and $4.20 offering resistance. Na=
tural gas for next day delivery across the US  dropped $0.05 - $0.15 per MM=
Btu, except out west where prices continued to  tumble. Canadian spot price=
s rebounded from yesterdays sharp decline. Natural  gas for next day delive=
ry at the Henry hub lost $0.07 to $3.69 per  MMBtu.

Senate Democrats to Investigate High Energy Prices

    The new Democratic chairman of the  Senate  Governmental Affairs Commit=

t Bush and FERC chairman Hebert are against electricity price  caps, arguin=
g they would discourage firms from building new power plants and do  nothin=
g to encourage conservation. California represents 15% of the economy and  =
any major downturn there would have rippling effects across the nation,  Li=

Canadian Producers Investigate Coal Gas
=20
    Canadian producers are counting on obtaining big natural  gas volumes f=
rom shallow coal seams. Alberta Energy, Nexen, PanCanadian  Petroleum and P=
enn West Petroleum are spending millions of dollars to  investigate whether=
 natural gas trapped in coal beds less than 3,300 feet deep  can be produce=
d economically.  The US derives 7% of its natural gas  production from coal=
 seam gas. Western Canada is estimated to have between 135  Tcf and 260 Tcf=
 of recoverable coal gas. Natural gas fields containing at least  17 Tcf ha=
ve been discovered in Canada's Far North, but bringing them to market  will=
 cost billions to build new pipelines and other facilities. Advocates say  =
many coal deposits sit near existing processing plants and transmission lin=
es,  meaning coal gas fields will be cheaper to connect and produce than Ar=
ctic  reserves. The Alberta Research Council has spent several years resear=
ching ways  to enhance coal gas production and is looking for C$12 million =
to proceed with a  pilot project.=20

El Paso Market Power Abuse Investigation Continues
=20
    FERC's investigation into alleged market power abuse by  El Paso is sti=
ll proceeding a month after it began. Both El Paso and the  California PUC =
have painted contradicting versions of events, and the hearing  looks no cl=
oser to conclusion than when it began. El Paso is attempting to  discredit =
a study prepared by The Brattle Group, a Massachusetts consultant  hired by=
 Edison to find evidence that El Paso Merchant wielded market power. It  du=
tifully concluded that soaring California prices were not caused by regular=
  market forces and pointed to a conspiracy to widen border-basin price spr=
eads.  As part of El Paso's effort to tarnish the study, a professor of pol=
itical  economy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government testified that Br=
attle's tale  doesnt add up. In order to prove market power, he said 3 cond=
itions must be met:  * The system for getting gas to California must not be=
 full; * El Paso Merchant  must have unutilized, but available, delivery ri=
ghts; and * Other shippers must  have fully utilized their delivery rights.=
 The final condition, he says proves  that market power is impossible to es=

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the "MBTI Work Styles"-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.


For registration, please login to our website http://elm.enron.com "Management/Leadership"    If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.  Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.

Mike McConnell and Enron Community Relations is challenging Corp, EES, EGS (which includes ETS and Global Assets), and EWS to win the Race to Cure Diabetes.  

Which business unit  will sell the most shoes?

To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain or contact Janice Riedel at x37507.  The donation will represent a $10 contribution (with the company match) toward the research foundation.  Your shoe will be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26th.  Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Researchers are closing in on finding a cure.

The Cure for Juvenile Diabetes is within walking distance.

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.
