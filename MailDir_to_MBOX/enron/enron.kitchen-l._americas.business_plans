It looks like most of these assets relate to systems that Sally Beck's group uses.  These assets were moved off the ENA balance sheet earlier this year after discussions with you and Philippe.  Please advise if you want us to agree to these transfers.  Thanks!

Elaine,

Attached is a listing of the assets on ENW's books that they want to transfer back to EA.  The current book value as of 7/31/2001 is around $9 million dollars that would move into PP&E.  

If you look at the numbers off to the right and the notes below, you will see that some of them were originally designated as shared assets or solely ENW and therefore would reside on ENW's books.

In completing their 2002 plan and meeting with their commercial people, ENW thinks these assets should be back on EA's books.

Please let me know if you agree to this.

Thanks, 
Stacey

Hi Louise,

Attached are the May YTD soft Metrics for North America. In response to open items from last month:

(1) Canada had some concern related to the information provide for average EOL transaction count. After working with EOL and Canada, it was determined that the number of trading days that Canada used to calculate this metric differed from the number of days EOL used to calculate this metric. The EOL team and Canada are working to come to an agreement related to this as well as new customer presentation.

(2) Canada felt that the Origination metric was incorrect. We have sent them the support for the origination amount, which ties to the DPR, along with deal number, etc. (the same info that you see in the first attachment.) We are still awaiting a response from them. 

Currently we include deals with zero value within the deal count (you will see this on the attachment). Are you in agreement with this treatment?

Please let me know if you have any questions- I'm at x30352. Thanks!

Faith,

I spoke with Kevin Presto this morning and he informed me of two newly created groups within East Power.  The Options Desk is headed up by Harry Arora and currently has margin reflected on the DPR.  There is also a Services Desk which falls under Lloyd Will.  Kevin has requested two new costs centers to capture expenses and would like to see two new lines added to the Management Summary to reflect their P&L.

Thanks, Paula

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

In additon to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.

As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Hi Louise,
I am hearing that you and Rob discussed the Canada Svc agreement and settled on a number in the ballpark of $7M, which is comparable to last year. There is one change from last year that we may want to consider- the treatment of the Regulatory Affairs activity charged from Corporate. Last year Rob was not burdened with this cost. This year we discussed pushing these costs to the appropriate commercial teams. Please review the two attachments below and advise. Currently our proposed service agreement amount totals $10M.

I understand what you are looking for, and Bob Hall and I look forward to s=
itting down with you to review operations costs for Enron Americas.  I do t=
hink it will be meaningful to you to look at the components of the aggregat=
e number to understand all of the functions that are provided and the drive=
rs behind the cost structure for each function.  They are different.  Some =
costs are impacted by number of transactions, some are not.  For instance, =
all operating companies are allocated a portion of the cost of producing th=
e DPR each day and posting results on the Executive Reports Viewer.  Regard=
less of the number of transactions, there is a fixed cost for aggregating t=
hat information.   That fixed cost estimated for the year likely will not c=
hange.  What may change is the allocation methodology used -- i.e. if EEL a=
dds four new product lines to be aggregated on the DPR and if it is a very =
manually intensive task to get that information daily, then we may adjust t=
he allocations such that EEL's percentage of the total cost of producing th=
e DPR will be appropriately increased. =20

For the past two years, we have created the operations budget for Enron Ame=
ricas with a defined set of services as the underlying assumption in the bu=
dgets.  There have been times when we have had to add personnel to handle n=
ew businesses that have been created that were unknown during the budget pr=
ocess (ex:wellhead desk) or deals that are done that are very operationally=
 intensive (ex: asset management deals).  When this happens, we calculate t=
he fully-loaded cost of the person or persons required to support that new =
activity and have the commercial person responsible for that business sign =
off on the additional expense to be incurred that was not in the original o=
perations budget - a change order to the original budget.  =20

I know that Wes is coordinating the budget review meetings for Enron Americ=
as, so I will work with him to make that happen.  In addition, Greg Piper a=

Effective July 1, the Offshore Team under Jean Mrha is being eliminated.

Per Jean's discussions with John Lavorato,

The 3Q & 4Q origination plan of $7.812M for Offshore will go to Office of Chair.  
The accrual margin for MEGS is being transferred to  ECR.
The direct expenses will be reallocated to Jean's team.  The offshore team was incorporated in Jean's other teams.

Let me know if you have any questions.

As agreed please move MEGs to ECR as the management of this should reside with Mariner who are the counterparty in the transaction.

Thanks

After our phone call a few minutes ago this morning, I talked to Pickering and Beth Perlman.  On development capital and expense for 2002 for EA, they said Belden has agreed to a number and Will has agreed to a number and that they think they almost got Story on his.  They will also finalize Tommy Yanowski on his numbers this morning.  If you are hearing anything different from any of your EA team on development, call Mark Pickering ASAP.  
 
Also, we will get to you by 5 PM today the following seven ENW/EA numbers and we think that they will be real close:  
 
1.  EnronOnline expense in 2002 for EA in the cost based manner.  Whalley knows the $37.7 million total suggested 2002 number and has seen the cost based methodology.  However, we will work with all the business units going forward to try to get a fee/product/trade count system implemented in place of the cost based method but we have to juggle EA, EGM, EIM and EEL and getting agreement on that will be a real negotiation.
 
2.  Operations expense for 2002 for EA.
 
3. and 4.  Systems Development expense for 2002 broken in to two parts.  The first part will be 2002 systems development expense associated with operations/maintenance.  The second part will be new projects in systems development expense for 2002.  Mark has done a fantastic job with the team the last three days working with everyone getting these two numbers down to what is necessary and has agreement from Belden and Will and almost has Story done.  
 
5.  IT Infrastructure.  Wes and Faith and Kerry and Jenny met yesterday and agreed on a head count for EA and are meeting this morning on the entire EWS headcount.  Once Jenny has that right this morning and has the new EA 2002 development budget estimates, she will have a new number calculated for EA.  
 
6. and 7.  Capital for systems development and EnronOnline associated with EA for 2002.  As per the EA systems development expense above, Mark and the team have pulled the capital down for 2002 as well.
 
The key on the systems development budget for 2002 is making sure EA not only gets numbers that make sense, but understands exactly what projects and services they are buying/getting from those numbers.  Belden, Will and Story, working with Pickering and his team, will have that mostly completed today so that we don't have a disagreement later on what you will be getting in 2002.
 
The enitre ENW budget team across all EWS is meeting today at 4 PM to finalize all outstanding issues with any numbers.  We will have Kerry step out on or before 5 PM and send to you (or probably Faith) the seven draft numbers mentioned above.  We will work around the clock after that to get any marginal issues settled before Thursday morning.
 
We will get with you with you directly again late Thursday morning to finalize anything.  I will try to set this up today.
 
Thanks.

Paul:

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively "a cost of capital" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Regards,
Brian

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

In additon to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.

As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

Louise, 
Attached is the schedule as requested. Please refer to the comments I've listed. I'd like to revisit this schedule with you when you get a chance. 

 
I'm still working with IT to resolve the allocation issues. I've listed the numbers that I think are appropriate for the 2001 forecast.

Additionally I'm attaching the allocation from Global Finance. I'll schedule a meeting with them to review this allocation if you'd like.

Louise,

To make our ENW budget discussions most meaningful, we felt that coupling discussions of the Operations and IT Development budgets will make the most sense.  To insure that we have the appropriate attendees in our  ENW 2002 plan meetings and to schedule these meetings around Thursday as a religious holiday, I have worked with Wes Colwell and made a trade with Vince Kaminski to make all of this happen.  There is no change to your calendar in terms of date, time or location of meetings.  We have simply realigned topics and attendees as follows: 

Date			Time		Location	Revised Group			Revised Attendees 

Wed, 9/26		11 - Noon	EB3314		Canada Support (unchanged)	Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck, Rob Milnthrop,
											Bob Hall (added-responsible for EA
											Operations, including Calgary)
	
Thurs, 9/27		1:30 -2:30	EB3316		ENW: EOL & Infrastructure	Wes Colwell.Faith Killen,Louise
											Kitchen, Sally Beck,Mark Pickering,
											Jenny Rub, Greg Piper, Kerry Roper,											Brad Richter (added-EOL), Jay 												Webb (added-EOL)

Fri, 9/28		1 - 2pm		EB3316		Research			Wes Colwell, Faith Killen, Louise
											Kitchen,Vince Kaminiski (no 												changes)

I look forward to reviewing details with you in each of these meetings.  --Sally

Louise --

While I have already reduced the allocation to EA by 15% or over $400,000, I have talked with Accounting regarding your concerns and have suggested a few changes to the allocations.  The new suggested allocations are EA 30%, EGM 20%, EIM 20%, ENW 20%, EBS 10% and EEOS 5%.  This is based on services provided and headcount within the various business units.  The services include media relations, events, marketing & advertising, and internal communications.

There is no increase in headcount.  We are at 10 positions, which is the exact same number we have had since February 2001.  In fact, I reduced the size of the group by 2 positions when I was promoted to lead the department in May 1999.  The two reductions are one less person in Marketing and Advertising, and one less person in Events.  While the number of employees has fluctuated at times this year with departures from the group and prior to hiring a replacement, I currently have no openings and the group has 10 total employees.

Our allocation is huge compared to other business units.  Please provide data to support this for our budget meeting.  I am particularly surprized we are getting more headcount next year too.

Attached is the revised list with changes you requested.  I spoke with Frank Vickers about a few of the entries to ensure they were not duplicates with regards to Cities and their departs.  He advised that we would consider them two customers.

Example:	Talahassee, City of 
		Talahassee Electric & Gas Department

Frank's group is working on a second generation list which would have the first column represent the Holding Co, and the next column the subsidiary; this would greatly assist with sorting the information.   After your review I can send back to the gas teams and ask them to populate some of the missing data if you wish.

Regards,
Tammy

Louise, attached please find a revised version of Enron Canada's third quarter origination report.  Further to your request, we have corrected the numbers and have ensured that the numbers have been correctly allocated with respect to each originator.

Please note that the numbers for "De Stefano", "Di Stefano" and "Pastega" (maiden name) have been combined into one number for Cyntia Di Stefano.

The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively "a cost of capital" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

In addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.

Please remove these amounts from the ENA-HPL 2002 Plan.

As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

Hi Louise,
Can you please provide some guidance? Originally what we prepared for you has been an origination schedule each month. As you know, we've since added MPR items. Several commercial folks are now requesting that we add in accrual items. Are you okay with this?

Would you like to see two schedules each month- one with only true originations, then an additional report that includes originations, MPR, and accrual items?

I'm trying to get approval for the portion of my 2002 budget that is currently allocated to EA.  Currently my budget estimates that 25% will be allocated to ENA for mainly the projects listed below in my original message to Geoff.  .  Another 25% is allocated to EES to cover my groups efforts in coordinating their move to Wholesale systems.  The remaining 50% stays within Networks to cover commercial deals like HPL etc.  Most of the ENA projects that I work on are in Brians world with a small part of my time spent on coordinating projects in Calgary and EDI projects for gas nominations.  Who do I need to discuss this with?

I'm not sure your projects will directly affect gas trading and i dont know who to point you toward.

Geoff:  I understand that I need to get with you to approve the portion of my budget that is allocated the Enron America's.  Currently  $  299,871 is budgeted for allocation to EA.  My group coordinates JV activities as well as conducting due diligence on IT areas related to aquisitions and divestitures.  The amount budgeted above is for the following known projects:

		Coordination and Operations under the Bridgeline IT Services Agreement
		Due Diligence related to Project Sugarcane and how we may monetize our investment in Bridgeline

In 2002 ENA will bill Bridgeline $1,250,000 for IT Services.  Since Chevron/Texaco covers 60% of the bill ENA will net $750,000 in revenue for the services coordinated by my group.  

Let me know if you'd like to get together and discuss this in any detail.

I dont even see gas trading vision (maybe its the 'global trading vision').

Attached is a draft spreadsheet that captures the budget items reviewed with IT yesterday.

I have tried to correlate our description with their project name.  I have also created a starting budget and proposed budget for your review.  A % allocation row for east, west and cdn allocation has also been created for your review and comments.

The overall IT budget was brought down from 25.4MM to 16.3MM. 

Please review for any final comments as well as you comments on allocations.  Please note that the largest item was power fundamentals (6.2MM) which has bundled in it remote support, VMS support ect, it is IT's overall catch all accounts that require direct support of delivered  systems.

Louise,

Imbedded in these allocations are several functions for which EIM receives 100% dedicated resources (legal, HR, PR, etc.).  Every 100% dedicated resource should be presented in its own RC -- in that way it becomes "controllable" and measurable.  Today it is buried in an indirect allocation.  This approach will isolate the truly indirect allocations and allow us to better manage the amount and appropriateness of these expenses.  We plan to push this topic with respect to all allocations which hit EIM from Enron Americas, Enron Networks, or Enron Corp.  Kent Castleman (EIM CAO) is going to discuss this approach with Wes.

Regards,

Ray

As you know the budget planning cycle is upon us.  Several of the support functions role up under Enron Americas and then are billed out to the other Business Units.  I would encourage all of you to look at the initial allocations below you receive from each of these Support Functions in order to verify that you are satisfied with the planned charges to your accounts.  

Wes's group can provide you with this information.   

I will be meeting with the Support Groups over the next week and should you wish me to raise any issues on your behalf please let me know or please contact the group leaders directly.

As you can see from the Enron Americas allocation, I am hoping to make substantial changes to our numbers which reflect a substantially large increase from last year.

Regards

Louise

Hi Louise-
Thought this might be helpful in your review of Canada's cap charge. I've left a new plan for Canada, Upstream (Jean moved her cap charge from Upstream Executive to Offshore), and Restructuring (we adjusted their margin target to ($20.7M) -they've called themselves Merchant Asset Mgmt on the plan presentation- would you like for me to make the name change on our management summary?) Additionally, I've left the February 2001 Team Income Statement booklet for your review as well. These items are in Tammie's chair. Please let me know if you have any questions- x30352. Thanks!

Louise, the $10.9 million negative in the plan as presented to you consists of:

	Inland		$4.6 MM
	Masada	$2.9 MM
	Linder		$3.4 MM

	Total		$10.9 MM

These assets had been scheduled originally to go into raptor 2.  Without a raptor hedge, these represent the difference between estimated valuein a monetization and carrying value.

In addition to the above, the following items are incorporated into the $20.7 MM delta ENA exposure vs. base value

	Noram rig	$0.9 MM  --  The purchaser defaulted on purchase.  Our expectation for value is now lower.
	Ecogas		$2.4 MM  --   We acquired this asset after the budget.
	Canfibre LOC	$4.5 MM  --   This contingent liability may or may not be paid depending upon certain performance tests at the Lackawanna Plant
	Calpine		$2.0 MM  --  This is a drilling commitment.  I always view these on a dry hole basis.

	Total		$ 9.8 MM

I hope this clarifies the numbers.  Dick.

Pretty much correct.  Actual is:

Curry	$20,439,468
Sukaly	$0 (somehow 4 midmarketing deals I did got credited to Sukaly so I moved the $27,602 to me!)
Ahn	$12,181 (associate)
Jester	$10,000 (just started in group a couple of months ago)

Doug Gilbert-Smith supported me from the trading side to help get the wind deal done and he has been paid 50% of its value $18MM.  No one else was working with me on the wind deal other than support groups.  Portz in legal was instrumental in getting the contract done with Enron Wind.  Edith Cross and Greg Trefz in structuring also pulled long nights to get the deal approved.

Thanks, - Mike

Jim,

Lets get together to discuss - if we need to pull someone else into the discussion, then lets do it.  

The current structure for allocating insurance costs does not provide the correct price signals to the business units as to the real cost of holding assets.  This year we have been asked to increase our velocity of capital, cash flow, and our return on equity.  Corporate charges need to provide the correct incentives to accomplish this.  

I suggest that you use the "cost of capital charge" as a model to allocate cost that can be re-assessed and re-allocated at least at mid-year.  Given that this year is waning, I suggest that you absorb "freed up" insurance capacity at the corp level.  I imagine that if a business unit purchased an asset mid-year it would bear an allocation of insurance cost, so why not provide a savings when an asset is sold?

I will call to set up a time we can meet.

Regards,
Brian

P.S.  I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "once you complete your study of replacement cost values" - as nothing is being replaced?

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

The 2001 annual allocated premium for these assets for property insurance is $670,000 based upon ENA's 2001 reported value of approximately $470,000,000.  The pro-rata credit for 7 months, assuming a 5-31-01 sale date, would be $390,833.  

Underwriters require an update of values and exposures annually at renewal. Gathering these values within Enron normally requires 30 to 45 days.  We use these same values in the allocation system. Unless the value change is significant, the actual cost of insurance to the outside insurers will not change  Once you complete your entire study of replacement cost values, we can discuss whether approaching underwriters is warranted.

 If we internally adjust your allocation mid-year, we must move the premium that we take away from you to the other participants in the program.  As you know, the remainder of Enron did not stand still while you sold Bammel.  We have not tried this before, however, I suspect if approached with the additional premium as a result reducing ENA's allocation, all the other operating entities would want to re-submit their revised  values as well and we would find ourselves in a constant state of adjustment.  In view of the time required, this is neither practical nor cost effective for Enron.  In view of the relatively small numbers, I doubt that Corp. would entertain this proposition either, however, we can approach them if you wish.

Please let me know how much of the 2000 insurance premium is being allocated to the approx. $700MM of HPL assets.  This charge is effectively "a cost of capital" and should be re-allocated to other groups with insured assets or should remain at Corp.

Subject:	RE: Replacement Cost Values

Brian:

This insurance is purchased on a portfolio basis with payment to underwriters at inception of the coverage. Values are adjusted annually at renewal. The premiums are allocated to the participating entities as part of the budget process and insignificant additions and deletions of assets do not normally result in premiums additions or refunds.  In the event that we discontinue premiums to North America for HLP, we have no mechanism to allocate that premium to the other assets that continue to be insured. In the event of a significant divestiture, underwriters may consider a refund, however, the values discussed below would not likely be significant when compared to Enron's values as a whole. Additionally, Enron's adverse loss experience affects the underwriters ability to return premium for small divestitures. 

At renewal, 4/01/02, North America's revised property values will be declared to underwriters as part of Enron's overall values and your premium allocation will adjust depending upon your values and loss experience as compared to the rest of Enron. 

Regards,

Paul

In addition to the 188,371,296 property value for Bammel Lease that you mentioned below there was also a value on your spreadsheet for Bammel Gas Storage of 267,000,000.  Requirements to insure both of these amounts should be with AEP not Enron and thus the 2002 Plan Premium Allocations of $754,096 on the Bammel Gas Storage 267,000,000 value and $924,433 on the Bammel Lease value of 188,371,296 should not be needed.

As discussed for the purposes of the 2002 Insurance Budget, we will delete the Bammel Lease (1409) property values of $188,371,296. We will advise the insurers effective this past June to delete these assets and will attempt to receive a refund. However, as respects asset divestitures, insurers have not been inclined in the past to refund premiums for comparatively small divestitures in view of our adverse loss experience. However, if we are successful in receiving a credit, we will refund the premium.

I will discuss with Karen and Brian the other remaining assets.

Thank you for sending the revised plans.  I tried to make changes to the Bridgeline Income Statement, but could not alter the inputs.  As such, please make the following revisions for the 2001 Plan column:

Originations -					891
Accrual Income, Bridgeline Equity Earnings	9,600
Other - LRC / Napooleonville			1,146

Total Margin					11,637

Capital Charge					25,127

Total Margin Net of Capital Charge		-13,490


The capital charge has increased by an approved work order (No. C007579) of $2,749,865 to complete construction of Napoleonville Well No.1 .  This work was approved in 1996 as part of the original scope of the project and helps to satisfy and finalize ENA's storage capital contribution for BHLP.  However, no funding had been allocated to this work order. 

There will not be any more capital obligations on Enron's behalf for Bridgeline.

Since this work order applies to PP&E, I have charged 8.5% against the $2.75 million -- resulting in a capital charge of $ 234 thousand.  As such, to remain true to approved plan numbers, I have increased originations.

I will not be in the office tomorrow, but I can be reached by cell (713-302-4187).  In addition, Brian Redmond should be able to field any questions.

Jean

Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Louise

Enclosed you will please find the 2002 plan which has been revised for Expenses.  

The Indirects have increased based upon known allocations.  Additionally, the increase is related to the fact that IT had been incorrectly capitalizing most of the development support in 2001 until 3rd quarter  when we started reversing the capitalization.

Enclosed you will please find the 2002 Margin and Expense Plan related to your estimated cash flows for 2002.

Cash Flows were based on the current book and subsequent monthly liquidations over 2002.  To this average monthly balance, we added the average monthly increase in Gross Book Balance which has been provided by your group.  

Drift numbers have decreased considerably from 2000 due to decreased interest rates.  Please advise if you would like us to update this schedule for any changes to your new business estimate for 2002. 

Please feel free to call me or Clara if you have any questions.

	*  Provide origination and trading groups with energy related geographic information (GIS)
	*  Develop a regulatory position to present to the FERC proposing fundamental changes to current transportation trading rules

Everything else can be left as is (though I do not know where you got the 2000 forecast numbers since this group did not exist until this year)

Louise --

Here is the analysis on how many Govt Affairs' FTEs work on Enron Americas matters.  

The bottom line = 67 Professionals in group / 29 FTEs on Enron Americas.  Call if you want additional information.

Also, I am trying to arrange a meeting for this Friday to discuss our next Monthly Update (which I am finishing hopefully tomorrow).

Thanks,

Jim

Louise:

Some guidance on how you want to handle the ongoing HPL costs/reserve management for next year.  Specifically, there will be a number of items that roll into next year that will have to be managed. I am going with the assumption that Jim will report into Wes and will be responsible for supporting this effort.  

Question:  Do you want me to assume: (i) that I have a seperate cost center for HPL and that has Jim's cost allocated to it, or (ii) should this whole effort just role up to Wes and then I can support it on an as needed basis? 

I'm open to either, but my recommendation is to keep some commercial oversight over the settlement of the outstanding HPL issues.  Because, if things start coming unglued, I'm sure I will get dragged back into it anyway.

Regards,
Brian
