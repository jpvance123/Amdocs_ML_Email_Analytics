We are pleased to pass along to you the fact that United HealthCare (UHC) and 
Memorial Herman Health Systems (MHHS) reached agreement on a long-term 
contract.   There will be no disruption in terms of accessing network 
services from the hospital system or those providers who were scheduled to be 
terminated.  Employees currently electing UHC will receive a confirming 
letter shortly from UHC.

As mentioned in our earlier memo, it is our understanding that Cigna has also 
been contacted by MHHS and are now in contract negotiations. 

Open Enrollment packages are in the mail and you should consider the above 
facts when making your decision on your medical election.

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Dear Ms. Crenshaw,

    I am very glad to see Professor Kaminski let me meet with him. I offer to
visit you around 3 p.m. on 17th Monday. I wonder if we can invite him for a
dinner that night because my colleague Mr. Yamada who also wishes to meet
with him will attend a Risk publication's seminar up to 5 p.m. on that day.
Please let Professor Kaminski  know we understand this offer may affect on
his private time and we do not insist on it. I am very much looking forward
to seeing him.

Dear Vince,
1.I apologize for not having got back to Karla
earlier but Dauphine is not properly equipped yet.
2.The conference with Samuelson,Merton,Heath,
Ross,McKean etc was spectacular.512 academics
and practitioners came to College de France and
 were very grateful.
3.I was so worn out afterwards that I did not make
it to Houston.I just went to visit Alex after a week
conference on Quantitative Risk Management
where I was speaking at Carnegie Mellon
4.Another former PhD student of mine has been
testing and improving the software.He is great
and modest ;giving the papers I referee and the
conferences I go to,I do believe that we are still
ahead(or way ahead)today.We also beautifully
simplified the valuation of the hourly swings.
Obviously,in case of a problem,my reputation
and your esteem would be more valuable
than 30% of 90,000 USD (to be shared ...)
5.I declined RISK in Houston and NewYork
and am not sure I will have the pleasure
to see you in London.In all cases, we
should coordinate for Paris soon

A friend of mine,Head of Research and New Projects in a major bank,
wanted to get in touch with the energy industry to possibly develop
working relationships.I said that Enron was the right place to start

My article "The Gas-Fired Future: Boom or Bust?
Last year brought prices not seen for decades. So consumers will buy less
gas, just as before, and send forecasts out the window." was just published
in April 1, 2001 issue of Public Utilities Fortnightly.

If you would like to receive a reprint when I receive them send me your
address.


Best regards,


JHHerbert

Congrats on the promotion to MD.  Well deserved and a sign of many years of 
real service to the company.  Not a bit of controvery in the election process.

Well done!

John

Vince,
How are you? I apologize for not contacting you earlier. We bought a small
house and it is consuming all of our time. We also adopted a little puppy
which proved to be a lots of work. Believe it or not, I have not had the
chance to visit NY city yet (I was there once briefly to drive to the
airport).
I just received the check for the airline ticket. Thank you for taking care
of this issue quickly. Shirley was, once again, superb. Take care. Hope you
have great holidays. If you happen to be in the NY area, please let me

Vince,
How are you?  Are we still on for Saturday?

Let me know what movie looks good.  We saw "MI 2" and really liked it.  We
also saw "Small Time Crooks" and it was slow.

Dear Vince,

I very much enjoyed speaking with you at lunch, if only briefly, at the
=01&Finance Festival.=018  We
have more common interests than I realized at first, as I am interested
not only in weather
derivatives, but also in the financial econometrics of risk management,
broadly defined.  And
moreover, business interests have recently led me to focus on electronic

trading and brokerage
issues.  A quick check of my web page will give you a good idea of the
range of my interests; see
http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~fdiebold.

The upshot:  It seems to me that we would both benefit from a more
extensive conversation.  I
would be happy to visit you in Houston to learn more about your
operations, and to tell you more
about mine.  Please do let me know if you are interested.

Best regards,

Frank Diebold

Dear Vince,
A friend of mine,Head of Research and New Projects in a major bank,
wanted to get in touch with the energy industry to possibly develop
working relationships.I said that Enron was the right place to start
and "you" the right person to meet.In this order,he would come to
the Power 2001 and I would introduce him to you.
Is this O.K with you?

Hello Mr. Kaminski,

I am available to meet with you for lunch this week on Tuesday (2/1), 
Wednesday (2/2). or Friday (2/4). Which day would be more convenient for you? 
Please let me know.

I am planning to meet with Mr. Chris Holmes (introduced by a mutual family 
friend) of Enron's Energy Services next week. Mr. Holmes also suggested that 
I meet with you.

Looking forward to the meeting. I will call you to follow up. For convenience 
I am attaching my latest resume.

Mark Lay:  Again, thank you for listening to my concept.  In my search for 
co-foounder/collaborators and
angel investors, disclosing the concept (for lack of a better title now, I 
call the system "LifeTrak")
and formulating a simple, clear picture is not easy.  The attached schematic 
depicts an overview of the
effort.  Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as 
participants and member
organizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.  
The groups fall into two
natural sectors;  (1) supply generators; and (2) user/service organizations.  
In the middle is the system
and its management that interconnects those benefiting groups and the 
donor/recipient LifeTrak
cardholders.  I can embellish more on these later.  The diagram gives us a 
place to begin discuss and
talking points in order to try to simplify how the concept could be developed 
and supported and where the
revenue model which creates dramatic efficiencies generates management and 
license fee.  I hope we can
get together soon.  Although Vince Kaminski cannot directly contribute due to 
his other commitments, I
have copied him to keep him advised (hoping that he might be able to do more 
at a later date.).  Best
regards, Al Arfsten

George,

This is the first cut at the problem you gave us, done by my associate 
Clayton Vernon.
Please, feel free to call him with any question. Your friend should check 
what were the sermons
he gave on April 19 and April 25, in 1998 and 1999, respectively.

Subject: Re: Spreadsheet for George Posey  

Vince-

Here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church.

First off, it appears from the data that a special "appeal" for fund giving 
was made (from the pulpit?) on April 19, 1998 and April 25, 1999, (perhaps 
tied rhetorically into Income Taxes?). Then, by going back and incorporating 
obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression 
analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:

giving this Sunday = $4403

+ a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since 
Jan. 5, 1997)

+ no pure effect from last week's contributions (i.e., denies first-order 
autoregressive effects)

+ $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas

+ $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999

- $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday

- $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving

- $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)

The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3 
years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for 
2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.

Clayton

I am helping my neighbor whose NEC PC was infected with a virus. We had to 
format the hard drive. He does not have the original Windows 98 CD-ROM to 
restore the operating system. How can we get a CD-ROM with Windows version 
for this specific type of a computer?

Al,

I have spoken with Mark Lay and he is interested.
Even if we cannot help you here in Enron, he may be able
to put you in touch with other CV groups in town.

Please, call him directly and give my name as a reference.
(713) 853-7408

Good luck.

Vince:  Your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of
the Lays is welcomed.  I hope that this would mean that you would remain
involved at some level.  The design of the model and its potential
economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be.   Enron could
be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to
commercialization could be successfully accomplished.  Please
confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the
interest generated.  I am ready to meet there at your building or
elsewhere that is appropriate.  Best regards,  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

Your  subscription to  the FRBNYRMAG1  list (Federal  Reserve Bank  of NY
Research Publications) has been accepted.

Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the
first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list. If you ever
need to leave  the list, you will find the  necessary instructions below.
Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all
future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail
folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you
are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on
vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up
your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  "welcome
messages" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after
subscribing to a new list.

To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,
just  send  mail  to   FRBNYRMAG1@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM.  This  is  called
"sending mail to the list," because you send mail to a single address and
LISTSERV  makes copies  for  all  the people  who  have subscribed.  This
address  (FRBNYRMAG1@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM)  is   also  called  the  "list
address." You must never  try to send any command to  that address, as it
would be distributed to all the  people who have subscribed. All commands
must be sent to the "LISTSERV address," LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. It
is  very important  to understand  the  difference between  the two,  but
fortunately it  is not complicated.  The LISTSERV  address is like  a FAX
number that connects you to a machine, whereas the list address is like a
normal voice line connecting  you to a person. If you  make a mistake and
dial the FAX number when you wanted  to talk to someone on the phone, you
will quickly  realize that you used  the wrong number and  call again. No
harm will have been done. If on the other hand you accidentally make your
FAX call  someone's voice  line, the  person receiving  the call  will be
inconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials every 5 minutes. The
fact that  most people  will eventually  connect the  FAX machine  to the
voice line to  allow the FAX to  go through and make the  calls stop does
not mean  that you  should continue  to send FAXes  to the  voice number.
People would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much the same way with
mailing  lists, with  the difference  that  you are  calling hundreds  or
thousands of people  at the same time, and consequently  you can expect a
lot of people to get upset if  you consistently send commands to the list
address.

You may  leave the  list at  any time by  sending a  "SIGNOFF FRBNYRMAG1"
command to LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. You  can also tell LISTSERV how
you want it to  confirm the receipt of messages you send  to the list. If
you do  not trust the system,  send a "SET FRBNYRMAG1  REPRO" command and
LISTSERV will send you  a copy of your own messages, so  that you can see
that the  message was  distributed and  did not get  damaged on  the way.
After a while  you may find that this is  getting annoying, especially if
your mail program does not tell you  that the message is from you when it
informs you that new mail has arrived from FRBNYRMAG1. If you send a "SET
FRBNYRMAG1  ACK  NOREPRO"  command,  LISTSERV   will  mail  you  a  short
acknowledgement  instead,  which  will  look different  in  your  mailbox
directory. With most mail programs you will know immediately that this is
an  acknowledgement  you  can  read  later. Finally,  you  can  turn  off
acknowledgements completely with "SET FRBNYRMAG1 NOACK NOREPRO".

Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a
list  of the  available archive  files by  sending an  "INDEX FRBNYRMAG1"
command to LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM. You  can then order these files
with a  "GET FRBNYRMAG1  LOGxxxx" command,  or using  LISTSERV's database
search facilities. Send  an "INFO DATABASE" command  for more information
on the latter.

IMPORTANT: This list is confidential. You should not publicly mention its
existence, or forward copies of information  you have obtained from it to
third  parties. Please  note  that the  "GIVE"  command is  automatically
disabled for all archive files.

More  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV
reference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an "INFO  REFCARD"
command to LISTSERV@PEACH.EASE.LSOFT.COM.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY & hope all is well.  As you may recall from the ROG real
options conference in NY, I'd indicated the opportunity to visit with you
next time I'm in Houston.  I'll be there during 4/18-4/21 & wonder if we can
pls meet on Wed. 4/19 in your offices.  Would appreciate it if you can pls
let me know whether you're available then (I'm flexible on the schedule
particulars).  If not, pls let me know whether 4/18 (afternoon), 4/20
(afternoon), or 4/21 (morning) will work for you.

I really look forward to the opportunity & would appreciate to learn more
about how you've instigated the real options thinking in Enron and
especially its integration within the organizational & incentive matters.

Many thanks,

LOUIS  RUKEYSER: Good evening. I'm Louis Rukeyser. This is Wall Street Week.  
Welcome back. 

Well, folks,  now you know why they call it black tie. 

Much of the  world of investors regards 2000 as a year of mourning -- for 
profits past, for  bubbles burst, for bulls de-horned and for certainties 
crumbled.

And let's face  it: It wasn't always fun. 

As Winston  Churchill put it, "I'm always ready to learn, although I do not 
always like to  be taught." 

Virtually  nobody except the non-stop pessimists -- who are still stone 
losers over the  past decade -- foresaw the viciousness of this year's 
declines -- although the  year was contradictory, even there.

For example, is  this a bear market? 

Well, yes and  no.

Even from their  highest heights in early 2000, the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average and the  S&P 500 have declined far less than the twenty percent that 
traditionally  has defined a bear market.

But for the  formerly high-flying technology stocks personified by the 
Nasdaq, this has not  only been a bear -- but the growly of all time.

Nasdaq, which  never does things moderately, fell nearly 40 percent this year 
-- and is off  more than 51 percent from its March 10th high. 

That makes this  not only the worst year ever for the 29-year-old Nasdaq, but 
the biggest  decline for any of the three major indexes since the S&P 500 
lost 47  percent in 1931, during the Great Depression. 

So devastating  was this latest, and most severe, tech wreck that any attempt 
to put it in  perspective -- by pointing out, say, that Nasdaq has been the 
bullish  phenomenon of the past decade -- and that it gained more than 85 
percent in  1999 alone -- is likely to seem like irrelevant ancient history 
to today's  bleeding tech investors.

Are they right?  Is this just a temporary reversal of a fantastically 
promising up-trend, or is  it truly the end of a booming era? 

Were the  downward catalysts of 2000 -- a fierce Federal Reserve, a steeply 
weakening  economy and a nation driven to embarrassing self-doubt by the 
Election That  Would Not Die -- passing phenomena or auguries of enduring 
change?

We'll try to  get you some meaningful answers tonight -- in the company of 
four  sharp-shooting panelists whose recommendations actually made our 
viewers  significant money in 2000 while the markets -- and most of their 
competitors  -- faltered. 

We'll review  what really did happen in 2000 -- to the economy and to 
investors -- and we'll  see if those four can be at least as helpful to us in 
the year ahead -- in  which, not to put too fine a point on it, Wall Street 
owes us all a lot!  

But, first,  let's see how the best-performing got better -- and the 
worst-hit got  hysterical -- in a characteristically mixed ending to a 
thoroughly mixed-up  year.

The Dow Jones  Industrial Average ended on a stronger note, despite a 
final-day sell-off,  gaining more than 150 points to close the year at 
10,787.99 -- making this the  Dow's first losing year since 1990.

Most indexes  followed the Dow's upward lead -- with the conspicuous 
exception of, you  guessed it, Nasdaq, which ended the year at less than half 
its March  peak.

But the elves,  filled with the holiday spirit -- or something -- continue to 
insist that  better times lie ahead both for the Dow -- where our haloes go, 
as usual, to  those who voted neutral three months ago, since when the Dow is 
up by just a  bit more than one percent -- and for Nasdaq, which we now 
insist they also  predict -- to see if that can improve their worst overall 
yearly record since  they were created.

There were  minimal changes in the bond and oil markets, and the dollar had a 
mixed week  -- as the long-suffering euro continued its recent rebound.

And if your  investments this year are giving you palpitations, try munching 
some of those  holiday sweets you've been trying to put out of your mind. 

A new report in  the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition says that 
chocolate may  protect against heart disease.

The theory is  that procyanidin found in the candy helps prevent build-up of 
blood  platelets.

Brian Rogers,  what's it going to take to build up investor psychology in 
Wall  Street?

ROGERS:  Well, Lou, I think what we've seen is a very natural transition this 
year away  from some of the higher-flying sectors of 1999. And I think 
investors as we  enter the new year will be focused on earnings progression, 
what the Fed does  with rates, and I think an awful lot will be determined, 
at least in the first  part of the year, on what happens to mutual fund cash 
flows. 

RUKEYSER:  When will we know that? A week or two from now, or will it take 
longer?  

ROGERS:  I think we'll see a lot of indications in January. I think the Fed 
will meet  several weeks into the new year. I think we'll see trends in 
mutual fund cash  flow data evident by the end of January. And then we also 
have the January  effect I suppose we can look forward to, to see how the 
first month of the  year shakes out.

RUKEYSER: So basically, if things don't look a heck of a lot  better by 
mid-January, that's going to be a bad sign.

ROGERS:  You can take the rest of the year off at that point. 

RUKEYSER: Thanks for your encouragement. Barbara Marcin, what do  you think? 
What's it going to take to pep up the investors? 

MARCIN:  Well, I think that we have much more reasonable expectations of 
profit and  growth priced into the market here. And I really think that what 
happened this  year was it was really a narrow group of stocks that really 
led the market  down. It was the same technology and telecommunication stocks 
which boomed so  much last year. And last year you could have a reasonable 
return which would  look very mediocre if you weren't invested in those 
stocks, and this year if  you have a reasonable return, it looks very good, 
because the telecom and  technology stocks declined so much. So I think it's 
really just been a matter  of resetting expectations, and I think we can 
still have a good market here  with a broad number of stocks attractively 
priced.

RUKEYSER: So it was a good thing that those jazzed-up fly boys  came down to 
earth, huh? 

MARCIN:  Well, I think it sets us up for a better year in the stock market 
certainly,  yes.

RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, Brian mentioned the Fed. How important is  the Fed in 
all this?

HOLLAND:  Well, I think the Fed made a big mistake. I mean they raised 
interest rates,  you know, 6 times in 15 months. You know, basically the 
economy, inflation was  not an issue at the time that they were raising it. 
And now of course they  took money out of the system because they put a lot 
in at the end of '99 for  Y2K issues, and now they've taken it out. So really 
I think they've dropped  the ball here, and I think that they're going to 
have to cut rates here over  the next month or so. 

RUKEYSER:  How much impact will that have? Wall Street expects them to do 
that  doesn't it? 

HOLLAND:  Well, I think it does, Wall Street expects that. But I think, 
again, to  see it is to believe it, and I think to the extent that Greenspan 
has sort of  been a follower, he has not been a leader. So I suspect that any 
positive  action here will be received relatively positively.

RUKEYSER: You mean the markets have led him. 

HOLLAND:  That's exactly right. 

RUKEYSER: And they're now leading him to a rate cut. 

HOLLAND:  Exactly. 

RUKEYSER: I  see. Well, I hope Mr. Greenspan understands that. Beth Dater, 
what do you  think?

DATER:  Well, that's an interesting point, because I think typically the 
stock market  is driven by the economy. What's sort of interesting about the 
last  year-and-a-half is that to some extent the economy has been driven by 
the  stock market and the wealth effect. And so I think what's going to be 
really  important to watch here is the consumer and whether the consumer can 
adjust to  a year in the stock market where you may have gains that are more 
like eight  percent than 25 or 30 or high double-digit gains. 

RUKEYSER: The consumer didn't seem to be too sanguine this  Christmas. 

DATER:  No, the consumer seems to be retrenching definitely somewhat here. 
And I think  the question will be, back to Brian's point, what will happen 
when the  consumers see their fourth quarter results in some of the mutual 
fund  business. It's something to watch very closely I think.

RUKEYSER: There was a fall off in the rate of net input into  mutual funds 
last month, which is not surprising. What do you think? Why  should people 
turn around and put a lot of money into mutual funds  now?

DATER:  Well, I think there's, I think that consumers also have to adjust to 
the  fact that, you know, the same 25 stocks aren't going to carry 
everything, that  there are areas of diversification, such as fixed income 
and value and other  styles of investing, where one can still receive good 
returns over time.  

RUKEYSER: All right. Now, before we look ahead with our winners  of the year, 
let's review where we've been in a year most investors would love  to forget. 

The Dow Jones  Industrial Average was the year's first victim, falling nearly 
2,000 points  after peaking in mid-January at a record 11,723 -- but then 
gained most of it  back, ending with a loss of just over six percent.

The S&P 500  peaked later -- in March -- but recovered less, losing a bit 
more than ten  percent for the year.

But the true  carnage was restricted to the Nasdaq, which was butchered by 
more than 39  percent.

In contrast,  both the New York and American Stock Exchange composite indexes 
-- which track  all the common stocks traded there -- eked out small gains 
for the year --  while the small-stock Russell 2000 was down by just 4.2 
percent.

Even a bad year  for stocks and a hint of inflation couldn't revive the 
fortunes of the  investment world's longest sufferers -- the gold bugs -- 
whose favorite metal  continued to tarnish. And silver did even worse.

The strong man  of the year was the U.S. dollar, which easily outperformed 
all other major  currencies, with a particularly dazzling gain of 12 percent 
against the  yen.

Meanwhile, the  U.S. economy continued -- as it has now for nearly ten years 
-- what has  become a record expansion -- but new doubts about its durability 
arose as  growth slowed in the third quarter to just 2.2 percent and the 
fourth quarter  seemed even weaker.

There was a  slight whiff of inflation midway through the year, helped along 
by a stunning  rise in oil prices and a period of excess money creation by 
Fed officials, who  last year took the Y2K threat too seriously. By November, 
there was some  relief -- consumer prices for the past 12 months had 
increased 3.4 percent,  ahead of the pace a year ago, but off the summer 
highs.

Continuing to  defy old-fashioned economic textbooks, unemployment remained 
low, even as  inflation blipped -- and the economy chugged forward. U.S. 
unemployment  reached a three-decade low at 3.9 percent, and as of the last 
monthly report,  in November, was still holding at just four percent.

Even the  ever-edgy bond market stopped trembling about inflation -- and with 
the  prospect of a softer economy, the ghouls rejoiced. The yield on the 
30-year  Treasury bond was driven down to 5.46 percent -- more than a full 
point lower  than where it was a year ago.

But short-term  rates -- which are more-easily controlled by the Federal 
Reserve -- climbed  nearly as much as long rates fell. The average yield on 
taxable money-market  funds is now up to six percent.

The year's big  international economic story was oil. From below $11.00 a 
barrel just two  years ago, oil climbed over $37.00 this past September 
before retreating to  today's $26.80 -- a little more than a dollar higher 
than a year  ago.

For the fourth  year in a row, the U.S. trade deficit is setting a record in 
2000 -- and next  April will mark a full quarter-century since the U.S. last 
saw even a monthly  trade surplus.

And where do we  go from here? The Conference Board's index of so-called 
leading economic  indicators has been anemic throughout 2000 with outright 
negative readings in  four of the past five months.

Brian Rogers,  which of these numbers, if any, is the one to watch in the 
2001  markets?

ROGERS:  Lou, I think the most important thing will be what happens to 
corporate  earnings in the first half. Things have been sluggish in the 
second half of  this year, and I think as we enter the new year corporate 
profitability will  be the most important thing affecting how investors view 
markets. 

RUKEYSER: And what's your guess on how that will turn out?  

ROGERS:  I think we'll have a decent profit year, but when I say decent, Lou, 
my best  guess is in the five to seven percent range, and not much more than 
that, from  a corporate profitability standpoint. 

RUKEYSER: Do you think the markets are expecting that?  

ROGERS:  I think the markets are expecting a little bit more than that, which 
makes me  think we might continue to have some, again some choppiness in the 
first part  of 2001. 

RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, what are you going to keep your eye on? 

MARCIN:  I'm going to keep my eye on the consumer confidence levels. You 
know, we  had three forces which slowed the economy this year: the Federal 
Reserve  raising interest rates, high oil and gas prices, and really a sharp 
drop off  in consumer confidence as the stock market fell, and that slowed 
spending a  lot. And I think that if that were to get much worse or consumers 
really  stopped spending, that could spiral a little bit more into companies  
incorporating that and having layoffs, and really then we could get a  
recession. So that's what I'm keeping my eye on.

RUKEYSER: Consumers have been the heroes and heroines of this  whole 
expansion. 

MARCIN:  Yes.

RUKEYSER:  There are some signs they're flagging a little, but you want to 
see how  much. 

MARCIN:  Yes. 

RUKEYSER: What's your guess? 

MARCIN:  I think that, right now I'm not predicting a recession, so I'm not 
predicting  that they're going to flag that much more. We just had, this week 
the third  straight month of a fall off in consumer confidence. And I think 
that perhaps,  come the new year, we can regain it, but that is what I'm 
concerned about.  

RUKEYSER: Lou Holland, how about you? 

HOLLAND:  I agree with Barbara. I think the consumer sentiment has 
deteriorated, and I  think that there's probably a greater than 50-50 chance 
that we're probably  going to have a recession. It's sort of the old notion 
of the Federal Reserve  pushing on the string in order to get the economy 
going by reducing rates or  injecting money into the system. And I'm not so 
sure that the system will  swallow it quick enough to stop us from falling 
into recession.

RUKEYSER: So you think the Fed has waited far too long.  

HOLLAND:  I think so. 

RUKEYSER:  Do you think there's a chance that they'll cut more than a quarter 
percent  next month? 

HOLLAND:  I think it's possible that they could have an interim meeting to 
cut, and I  think it's very possible they could cut a half a point. 

RUKEYSER:  Beth, can you cheer me up any more? 

DATER:  Well, I think it gets down to interest rates, because I think that is 
what  will ultimately influence the consumer confidence. I'm a little bit 
concerned  about the dollar in here. I mean I think that we have had a huge 
amount of  foreign investment also into our capital markets here, and if the 
dollar were  to weaken substantially, that might be at risk, and we might see 
some  repatriation of some of those foreign investments. 

RUKEYSER: All right. Now comes the moment of truth when we turn  the 
spotlight on what these folks said twelve months ago.

In what has  been for decades the toughest competition in investing -- the 
lists cannot be  changed for any reason during the ensuing twelve months -- 
it was a tough year  even for our certified geniuses -- though the average of 
all our panelists  continued to beat the performance of the S&P 500, let 
alone the sagging  Nasdaq. 

You can check  all their records on our web site. It will be up after 
midnight tonight. As  you'll see, the five who actually defied the odds, and 
made you money in 2000,  included the four stalwarts here tonight.

Brian Rogers,  to show what a weird year it was, you were the second-closest 
of all our  panelists, behind Marty Zweig, in predicting the Dow's 2000 high 
and close --  though even you were too optimistic by nearly 800 and 1,000 
points,  respectively. That was good this year.

But in the  far-more-important, actual money-making part of the competition, 
you excelled  -- with a portfolio of specific recommendations that, according 
to  calculations by our friends at Bloomberg Financial Markets, was up a 
whopping  42.5 percent, aided by three timely short sales and a near-double 
in Bergen  Brunswig. Congratulations!

ROGERS:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER:  Barbara Marcin, with both you and Brian here, it's clearly the 
value  players' night out. While your prediction that the Dow would get above 
14,000  turned out to be ridiculously high, you came within 11 points -- 11 
points --  of nailing the precise Dow low of 9796.03. And better still, your 
portfolio is  up more than 40 percent in this generally-grim year -- thanks 
to the best  single pick of any panelist, Everest Reinsurance Holdings -- 
which rewarded  you with a 222-percent gain. So thanks, Barbara, for bringing 
us so much  value! 

MARCIN:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER:  Lou Holland, welcome back to your fourth year-end appearance, the 
most of  any panelist here tonight, and you earned it. While your high, low 
and close  were way off the mark -- a familiar song this year -- your 
portfolio was up  more than 28 percent, powered by the more-than-doubling of 
Washington Mutual.  Way to go, Lou. 

HOLLAND:  Thank you. 

RUKEYSER: Beth Dater, this is your third year-end program. And  your cautious 
approach to investing in 2000 -- including putting 20 percent of  the 
portfolio in three-year Treasury notes -- paid off with an average gain of  
more than 7.5 percent. In 2000, that looked awful good. So congratulations,  
Beth.

DATER:  Thank you, Lou. 

RUKEYSER:  But enough with the compliments -- however well-earned in a year 
like this  past one. There's a new, and we hope different, year ahead -- and 
what have  you done for us lately? For starters, in our annual triumph of 
hope over  experience, let's hear from each of you the true inside word on 
the highest  close, the lowest close, and the final close for both the Dow 
Jones Industrial  Average and Nasdaq in 2001. And this time, gang, let's all 
get it exactly  right. 

Brian?

ROGERS:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,500, a low of 10,000, and a 
close of  11,900. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 3,000, a low of 2,000, and a 
close of  2,250. 

RUKEYSER: Barbara? 

MARCIN:  For the Dow, I have a high of 13,000, a low of 10,500, and a close 
of 12,000.  And for Nasdaq, a high of 3,200, a low of 2,500, and a close of  
3,000.

RUKEYSER: Lou? 

HOLLAND:  For the Dow, I have a high of 12,936, a low of 10,100, and a close 
of  12,504. For the Nasdaq, I have a high of 3,090, a low of 2,101, and a 
close of  2,842.

RUKEYSER: Beth?

DATER:  Lou, for the Dow, I have a high of 12,175, a low of 9,781, and a 
close of  11,740. And for the Nasdaq, a high of 2,834, a low of 2,404, and a 
close of  2,734. 

RUKEYSER:  Okay. Well, one thing is for sure -- and this is my only 
personal,  unqualified guarantee of the night: At least some of them will be  
wrong.

But, if you'd  like to see the full predictions, with specific stock 
selections, from all 22  of our panelists, all those lists will be included 
in tonight's transcript --  which you can get for $7.50 by writing to 
Year-End Transcripts, Wall $treet  Week With Louis Rukeyser, Owings Mills, 
Maryland 21117 -- or, you can order  on-line, for $10.00, by visiting our web 
site at: pbs.org.

And now, let's  see what these fabulous four think are the very best buys for 
2001.

Brian?

ROGERS:  Lou, Aon Corp, Cypress Semiconductor, Disney, Exodus Communications, 
Fortune  Brands, Hasbro, Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Fund, Motorola, 
Octel, Ryder  (System), Sprint (FON Group), and Unisource Energy.

RUKEYSER: Barbara? 

MARCIN:  I'm keeping the two from this year's list that did not perform, and 
that's  Cendant and Mattel, and I'm adding Compaq, WorldCom, Lucent, Loral 
(Space  & Communications), AT&T Wireless, and Motorola. 

RUKEYSER: A little tech in there, hmm? 

MARCIN:  Yes. 

RUKEYSER:  Tech's going to have a little comeback you think? 

MARCIN:  That's right. Tech and telecom maybe.

RUKEYSER: Some of those bleeding people will be very happy to  hear that from 
a cautious person like yourself. Lou? 

HOLLAND:  Okay, I have Carnival Corp., CEC Entertainment, Ceridian Corp., 
Clorox  Company, Chase Manhattan Bank, Cognos Inc., Intel -- one of your 
favorites,  Louis -- Home Depot, Jabil Circuit, Microsoft, and WorldCom. 

RUKEYSER: My favorites are the ones that go up. The ones I hate  are the ones 
that go down. You know what Will Rogers said, there's nothing  hard about the 
stock market. You buy a stock, and when it goes up, you sell  it. If they 
don't go up, you don't buy. Beth Dater, your list? 

DATER:  Lou, 25% weighting in 3-year U.S. Treasury notes. The balance equally 
weighted  in Amgen, Berkshire Hathaway, Cisco Systems, Intel, MedImmune, 
Mellon Bank,  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Royal Dutch Petroleum, 
Schlumberger, Wal-Mart, and  Westwood One.

RUKEYSER:  Hearing as much financial services as I do, is that an interest 
rate  forecast as well?

DATER:  It's an interest rate forecast, and also it's a call on valuations, 
which I  think are still very interesting in that area. 

RUKEYSER: How about some of those fallen giants that you've  picked? That 
suggests to me that you don't think it's the end of the world.  

DATER: I  do not think it's the end of the world. And I do think it's a time 
of some  uncertainty and it's a time to think of preservation of capital 
first and  foremost, and therefore, I'm going with some household names at 
this point.  

RUKEYSER: Especially some that have been knocked so far down  that... 

DATER:  Exactly. The valuations are coming into reasonable levels.

RUKEYSER: Brian Rogers, let's hear from you on interest rates.  What do you 
think? 

ROGERS:  Lou, I think we'll see a normalization of the yield curve this year, 
so I  think we'll see short rates fall. The Fed will cut rates probably a 
couple of  times. And I think the big gain this year was in the long bond in 
calendar  year 2000. I think that game is probably mostly over would be my 
best guess.  

RUKEYSER:  And short-term rates you don't think are going to fall that much?  

ROGERS:  No, I think short-term rates will fall causing the yield curve to  
look...

RUKEYSER:  But how much do you think they'll fall? 

ROGERS:  I think they'll fall at least 50 or 75 basis points this year. 

RUKEYSER: Okay. If we can get that over the next two weeks, that  might help 
some of your inflows into your mutual funds.

ROGERS:  Well, we'll be happy then. 

RUKEYSER:  Thank you all very much. There we do have to stop. I hope you'll 
join me  next week twice -- first, for our regular program when my guest will 
be the  incomparable Abby Joseph Cohen -- and then for a very special, 
hour-long  "Louis Rukeyser's 2001 Money Guide" -- when my guests will include 
four  world-class industrial titans -- true shapers of our future in the year 
-- and  the century -- ahead.

Meanwhile, this  has been "Wall Street Week." I'm Louis Rukeyser, wishing you 
a happy -- and  infinitely more prosperous -- New Year.

NESA/HEA Members ~

Don't forget to join us tomorrow (Thursday, January 18th) for our first
Membership Mixer of 2001 at PAESANOS LOUNGE located at 213 Milam between
Franklin and Congress Streets in the downtown Market District.  Sponsored by
NATIONAL ENERGY & TRADE, LLC, the fun begins at 5:00 p.m. and your first
drink is free when you mention you're with NESA/HEA at the door.  There will
be a buffet available for our group as well as valet parking.

Remember that PAESANOS also offers a great selection of fine cigars for your
enjoyment while you network with other industry colleagues, and special
guest artist, YVONNE WASHINGTON, performs at 8:00 p.m.  We're expecting a
great turnout, so don't be left out!

As part of our Membership Drive, bring a new member with you and become
eligible for a great door prize, graciously donated by Kay Atchison
(NESA/HEA Co-Chair) from Duke Energy.  It's a great opportunity to renew
your dues as well.  Again, if you didn't receive your renewal in the mail,
I'm attaching a pdf file that can be opened in Adobe Acrobat.  If you don't
have that application, download it FREE from our website at www.nesanet.org.
Hope to see you there!  You can't afford to miss this event!

let's plan for it.

Please forward to me those brief topic write-ups you promised so that I can

Mark Lay:  I shared confidentially with Vince Kaminski my developing
concept of a highly inefficient not-for-profit enterprise with
dramatically increasing costs.  I believe that a for-profit economic
model is possible that should reverse these skyrocketing costs and
ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national, if not, global
impact of health care costs.   Vince seems to also believe in the
concepts potential.  The CEO of one of the biggest U.S. blood banks has
already asked to become involved.   I would like involve more people
with vision, means and desire to help make this a reality.  I would look
forward to meeting with you to talk further.  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Iris Mack

Dear Vince,

bardzo dziekuje za podeslana literature, szczegolnie drugie wydanie
ksiazki. Bylismy w Londynie w czerwcu zeszlego roku, ale w ksiegarni
znalezlismy tylko piersze wydanie. Obaj z Alkiem (ojcem) wspolpracujemy z
energetyka (glownie Polska) od kilku lat. W zeszlym roku wydalismy ksiazke
"Gielda Energii: Strategie zarzadzania ryzykiem", a obecnie pracujemy nad
jej angielskim wydaniem. Na jaki adres Ci ja przyslac?

Serdeczne pozdrowienia,

Rafal

Shan,

It's nice to hear from you. Congratulations on the new job.
FT is my favorite publication I never miss (and I read a number
of different FT publications, including FT Energy collection).

You can contact Harry Arora (X 6750)  here in London who works on
finance related E-commerce projects. He may give you some useful
comments. I shall be myself very interested in the first issue
of your new publication.

Regards

Vince

Hullo, Vince:

I hope you're very well.  As you can see, I am now working for the FT's
magazine publishing business; I have responsibility for what's currently 
termed
the Expatriate Division and I've just passed my statutory probationary period
of 3 months. Apologies for not contacting you sooner - but I guess you knew
you'd hear from me sooner or later , especially when I need help! Having 
gotten
thru probation, I am set loose upon new projects......I'm investigating 
several
ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on
one of them.

Very basically, I want to develop a magazine product for the international
private investor, specifically
o HNWIs
o Owner-managers
o Results-oriented but intelligent investor with long-term investment goals 
and
a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and/or brokers on
something approaching equal terms

The product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of
private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for
themselves. The product would aim to cover the major asset classes, including
the "wilder shores" such as Hedge Funds and Emerging Markets. I am working on 
a
portal site (imaginatively entitled FTEXPAT.COM!), nested within FT.com, which
will launch in October; International Investment will be a significant channel
on the site, and a key distribution/marketing channel for this (and future)
offering. At this very early stage I am testing out the reaction to the notion
of such a product - do you have one? Would you be able to suggest any other
contacts who might be willing/able to share their thoughts with me? I know 
it's
not bang in your sphere but I'm hoping you'll be interested enough to share
your thoughts with me.

If you can give me a few pointers, I'd be grateful. Looking forward to hearing
from you,

Geoff,

You have very beautiful daughters. You must be a very proud father.

I shall try to attend a few sessions of the CERA conference. You can also
call me when you are in Houston and we can meet for dinner and/or drinks.

Helyette,

Sorry  for not getting back to you earlier. I took a few days off before my
family goes back to California.

I have arranged a replacement for you for the Houston and New York RISK
courses. My colleagues, Stinson Gibner and Steve Leppard, gave two
presentations. I shall be speaking in London on Thursday only. Steve Leppard
will make a presentation on Friday in my place.

I look forward to meeting you in London. I want to make sure that we can sit
down for a few minutes and talk about the Paris presentations.

Helyette,

Sorry for not getting back to you earlier.
My schedule was quite crazy over the last few days.

I shall be in London on Sunday meeting my group for dinner at 7:30. Can I 
call you around 
6:00 - 6:30?

Vince

P.S. You can send a reply to my AOL address.

dear Vince,
Our Workshop has already 20 registered delegates,
which is very good given the French power situation.
Moreover,French people tend to be fairly educated
and we should coordinate a little bit.
I am leaving in 30 minutes for 2 days.Can we talk on Sunday
at 7 or 8 p.m my time?My 2 numbers will be
33 1 46040110 or 33 6 08074200
Alex would agree to speak for a while as we did in Francfort.
Karla sent me a proposal for the Escrow problem.I had a
further question in your direction regarding "system support".
Karla,as you know,would kindly like to wrap up the contract
before moving to a new Department and I will  do my very
best to satisfy her wish and your feasible requests.
Kind regards
Helyette

I have received an inquiry through one of our employees (David Barr)
from Chicago Partners, a consulting firm in Chicago. They specialize, among 
other
things, in regulatory economics and could be useful as experts in our 
discussions with
the government and regulatory agencies.

One of the partners, Christopher Culp, is a well known commodity markets
expert.

Please, let me know if you are interested.

Vince -
I couldn't have been more pleased than when I saw your name on the Managing 
Director promotion list last January - who says nice guys finish last!  

I've had the announcement in my "to do" folder all this time, waiting for me 
to catch up enough to send you this message, but I guess you're no stranger 
to that scenario....

Nothing stochastic about it, you're simply the best!

Betty  :)

Dear Mr. Kaminski, 

We will be glad to have you with us this Saturday for the Mock Sales Day.

This event is part of our recruitment process. So far this semester the 
recruitment has been very successful - we have 16 new members, compared to 10 
experienced ones. 

The next goal is to keep these people interested in what we do and build the 
AIESEEC spirit in them. I hope that this saturday will greatly contribute to 
that. 

Here is the schedule so far:
 
9:00 - 10:00 Breakfast
10:00 - 12:00 Sales Training Session
12:00 - 1:00 Lunch break (Board of Advisors and Alumni coming)
1:00 - 3:30 Practice Sales Calls

Some details:

I don't have the training program finalized yet, but I'm  sure it will be 
good. I have a teacher from UH Program for Excellence in Selling and the  
local committee president, Tim, organizing it. It should be interactive and 
motivating :).  If you are interested you are more than welcome to come in 
the morning and have fun with us. 

I'm inviting the Board of Advisors members and some alumni to join us at 
noon. Lunch will be provided. Our members are cooking! And it is a very 
international crowd! So far we have German meatballs, some Venesuelan soup 
(don't remember the name, but it's supposed to be very good and a lot of it), 
Spanish tortilla de patata and other international dishes. 

The part when you would help is the practise sales calls. This is a way to 
provide experience to our new members, we are inviting our board of advisors, 
alumni and everyone who is interested in AIESEC to play as company 
representatives. I will give you case scenarios, everyone will have an office 
and the new members will have to "sell" AIESEC to you. One of the goals of 
the organization is to create as many exchange opportunities as possible, so 
the new members will try to get you to sign a contract for taking an 
international intern into your imaginary company. 

I hope you find it interesting :). 

Directions to UH, College of Business:

take I-45 South, exit Spur 5, at the street light at the end of the freeway 
take a right, at Calhoun street light take a right again, the College of 
Business will be on your left hand side. Park in the parking lot in front 
(you don't need a permit on the weekends).

Please, let me know if you are coming and what time and I will make sure 
someone will meet you at the entrance of the building. 


Thank you for your time,
Biliana

Vince,

Your suggested arrangement is perfect with me and I love both Italian or
Steak... the choice is yours.  I really look forward to our meeting & I will
be @ the hotel's reception area on time.  It's great that I have your
cell-phone...as a contingency, and just in case you needed to call me, it's
best to leave me a message @ my phone # @ work.

Soussan,

Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the
Galleria.
I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?).

You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.

Look forward to meeting you.

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully
your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are

catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your
insights, and the risk book you gave me.

I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits
you better.

Best,

W liscie pomylilam sie? - zamiast 25,25$  napisalam 15,25 $. Przepraszam.

Subject: visit?


Dear Vince,

I very much enjoyed speaking with you at lunch, if only briefly, at the
=01&Finance Festival.=018  We
have more common interests than I realized at first, as I am interested
not only in weather
derivatives, but also in the financial econometrics of risk management,
broadly defined.  And
moreover, business interests have recently led me to focus on electronic

trading and brokerage
issues.  A quick check of my web page will give you a good idea of the
range of my interests; see
http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~fdiebold.

The upshot:  It seems to me that we would both benefit from a more
extensive conversation.  I
would be happy to visit you in Houston to learn more about your
operations, and to tell you more
about mine.  Please do let me know if you are interested.

Best regards,

Frank Diebold

Sherri:  As a side note, Professor Bodily was visiting with Vince yesterday
and was impressed with the pictures that are in each of the elevators - 
showing Enron's "Vision and Values".  He asked me if I could possibly
find out how he could get copies of the prints.  Are they available anywhere,
and to anyone?  Did our graphics dept. do them? 

If you have any information, please let me know.

Vince,

Thank you so much for meeting with me Friday morning about the Research 
Group.  

After leaving your office, I remembered an issue I have had with the Analyst 
& Associate Program that might be of interest to you.

During a Texas A&M recruiting meeting, I learned that we have expanded our 
list of majors to include computer science.  I wondered why math majors were 
not mentioned, and was told that there was not a business need for math 
majors.  Like liberal arts majors, they said math majors were only considered 
on a person by person basis.  In my opinion, math majors have many of the 
same skills as finance majors, and can easily adjust to accounting rotations 
as well (I did last summer, and finance majors in the program are forced to 
every year.)  I think that Enron is missing out on many qualified candidates 
by limiting their recruitment effort.  

At Texas A&M the Career Center asks companies for a list of majors they are 
targeting, and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the 
career center.  I sent my resume to Enron and asked to be included in the 
interview process on campus.  However, many other math majors had not heard 
of Enron or the other companies, and assumed that there was no place for a 
math major at a company like Enron.  Many math majors want to continue their 
education, become teachers,  or work for an actuarial firm.  However, many 
are undecided.  We are constantly told of the many business possibilities 
available to math majors by our teachers and staff, but many undergraduates 
are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business 
environment.  By not mentioning math majors to the career center (a very 
simple and inexpensive step), Enron is losing out on a very talented pool of 
people.  While it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about Enron 
already, had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math 
majors would fit perfectly, and went the extra step to send Enron their 
resume outside the career center system, there are many qualified students 
who do not do this, and opt for other companies who DID mention math majors.

I called a manager in the A&A program to suggest that we consider at least 
mentioning math majors to the career centers.  I realize that it may cost 
more to actively pursue them, talk to teachers, and attend math society 
events.  However, I told her that including them at the career center would 
be very inexpensive for Enron.  She reiterated that they saw no business need 
for math majors, and that if more upper level people began requesting them, 
it would be considered.  I searched for "mathematics" on the Enron job 
website, and had a surprising number of results.  I know that your group 
could use math majors as well.  However, this still may be too small a number 
to merit a focus from the A&A recruiting department.  I just wanted to bring 
it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed.

Thanks,
Heather Johnson

The attached article confirms that although a few relatively progressive E&P 
(and mining) companies are beginning to absorb some of the benefits of 
hedging, they still find the subject very slippery.

Vince, 
I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. 
My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from 
consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I 
have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which 
fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some 
one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. 
Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my 
manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk 
management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for 
GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little 
more hectic than  usual. 
Talk  to you later.

Jana,

"Cotton Mary" sounds good. It's a film by Ismail Merchant who collaborated
on "A Room with a View", "Howard's View", and other well known movies.
It's a story about two Anglo-Indian sisters.

Vince,

The Angelika has several movies that would be good.  I am familiar with all
but one--"Cotton Mary."  Do you know anything about it?

If you still haven't seen "American Beauty", that is fine with us.  Just let
me know what sounds good to you. We are  flexible when it comes to movies.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Since I am just about starting off on my research, I do not have any papers
published in this area.  But I do plan to address this shortcoming pretty
soon. I have a couple of other papers against my name, but they are not
worth any serious mention.

I thank you for taking time off your busy schedule to write to me.  I will
keep you posted about my progress.

Thank you,

Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much for your prompt response. I look forward to
receiving a
copy of your article.

I would also appreciate it if you could let me know whether Enron
provides
research grants to individuals who are working in the area of Energy
Risk
Management.  Towards my research, I am trying to develop a model to
estimate
electricity spot price.

In any case, I will be getting in touch with you again a year or so down
the
line when I am nearing completion of my dissertation because Enron is my
dream job.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

Yours sincerely,

Jodi,

Chris can set up a conference call with myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin Lu 
to discuss
the real option applications. My assistant Shirley Crenshaw, 3-5290, will be 
glad to help him.

Hi Jodi,

I have been remiss in keeping up with you and letting you know what is
going on
in my little world here at Kellogg.

In other matters, life at Kellogg has me very busy at the moment.  I am taking
a full load, including Fin Decisions and am helping Prof. Petersen write a new
class called Advanced Valuation, which will be offered in the spring.  A big
part of the focus of this class is going to be on real options, which is cool
stuff.  And as poor as my timing is, I would like to ask you a
question/favor.
For purposes of this class, do you think it would be possible to obtain
some of
Enron's thoughts on real options?  I was thinking, for example, that a
fuel-switching analysis would be neat to included in the case packet.  Of
course, none of the numbers or names need be real-- only the concepts.  Well,
let me know what you think of that-- who knows, Enron might actually like the
free exposure.


All the best,

Chris

Dear Ms.Feldman,
Please receive all my apologies for not having
answered earlier your 2 emails,but I was in the
States for 6 weeks and could not access my
Dauphine email.In any case,the time was
fruitfully used by my associates and myself to
improve the "robustness" of the product,from
a computer and mathematical standpoint.
Regarding your 3 points
1.We agree on the price of 90,000 USD
2.D-G will provide system support:we can do so
by emailing anther version of the software,being
available on the phone and by email but we
cannot promise unlimited support of all kinds
without risking bankruptcy right away.
Moreover,the $ 90,000 may be paid in 3 fractions
and your risk would be quite minimal
3.Regarding the escrow,we have been using so
far a small law firm with 5 partners(none of my
family) in Amherst:Hart,Reed,Brown,Golowich
and Kaplan.But we are not closed to anther
solution you would strongly prefer.
Best regards

Jana,

A correction. I am going to spend one week in Australia and I have
just realized that I have to leave on Friday, July the 14th, at night,
to arrive in Sydney on Sunday morning.

Maybe we can meet on Friday the 7th (we would like to invite you
to dinner and then we can have a glass of wine outside, the weather
and mosquitoes permitting).

Alternatively, we can meet during the weekend of July the 29th.


Vince

On Wednesday, June 14th I attended your presentation entitled "THE CHALLENGE
OF VALUATION OF ENERGY RELATED DERIVATIVES" at the Risk 2000 conference in
Boston.  Can you please e-mail me the slides you presented.

Also, you mentioned that the method you used to calculate volatility for
energy prices was not the "normal" method.  Can you please tell me, or give
me a reference to the method that you did use.

Dear Vince,

How are you?

I am just wondering whether you have received the
email I sent to you a couple of weeks back.  In that
email, I asked whether you would have time to write me
a recommendation letter to support my application for
a Master Program (Mathematical Finance) in Columbia
University this coming fall.  If you will be able to
write the letter, would you please let me know?
Thanks a lot.


Best Regards,

Vincent Tang

Vince,
 We wanted to thank you for your time and support today.  We have been 
thinking about our conversation and it may be better to wait until December 
before you approached Delainey.  This time period would give us the 
opportunity to change his impression of our contributions to gas and power.  
Please let us know if you would advise differently.


Thank you,

Kristin and John

Soussan,

Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the Galleria.
I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?). 

You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Soussan,

Thanks for your message. It would be great to meet you when you come to
Houston.
 I shall be in town on December 7,  flying back from Philly in the morning.
Assuming that the flight is on schedule, I shall be available for dinner.
Please, let me know how I can contact you on Thursday, December the 7th,
to confirm.

Look forward to meeting you.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are
available either evening for dinner.  Would be great to see you again and
catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your
insights, and the risk book you gave me.

I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits
you better.

Vince,
 
I have  left a voice mail to you and will wait to talk to you personally. My brother  Vikas, who is now in London, is trying to make a switch from consulting world to  working for a specific firm. Over last few months, I have heard of great deal  about the success of Enron on line business which fits well in the area of his  expertise. I am wondering if you know of some one in London who he can speak to  regarding career opportunities. 
 
Since  I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my manadate was  broaden to include leading a charge for developing a risk management function  for both the domestic and international businesses for GMAC. Needless to say,  this is exciting albeit making the life a little more hectic than  usual.
 
Talk  to you later.
 
Anurag

Mark,

I called Rick to let him know. It's not an interview  yet. Aram is coming for 
a
wedding but I think he wants to explore the opportunity of coming back
to Enron. The conversation may lead to an interview
at some point.

He will talk to Andrea as well.

Do you plan to organize something for Aram?
I would be glad to join.

Dzien dobry,

Mam nadzieje, ze nic sie nie zmienilo i jestesmy umowieni na dziesiejszy

bezowe buty i szara bluze. Nie jestem pewien czy bede mogl przeczytac 
potwierdzenie, bo od 10 do 11.45 przeprowadzam szkolenie.

Vince,

Thanks for the note - and congratulations on yours as well.  

I haven't had too much to do yet with the research guys here as they're 
pretty much self directed.  Once a week (Thursday AM) I've started a joint 
project update meeting with Structuring and Research.  I hope this way the 
Structuring team can bounce quantitative issues off Research and the Research 
guys can stay closer to the commercial deals.  

- Dale

TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family.

Thank you for your message. The credit card I want to use is currently stored
in your system. When I want to update the billing information with this card
number, I am getting the answer: Credit card already in use. The card is in
good standing and there is absolutely no problem with this card and there was
never any problem. I don't understand why your system failed. I think that
this is your problem, not mine.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY & hope all is well.  As you may recall from the ROG real
options conference in NY, I'd indicated the opportunity to visit with you
next time I'm in Houston.  I'll be there during 4/18-4/21 & wonder if we can
pls meet on Wed. 4/19 in your offices.  Would appreciate it if you can pls
let me know whether you're available then (I'm flexible on the schedule
particulars).  If not, pls let me know whether 4/18 (afternoon), 4/20
(afternoon), or 4/21 (morning) will work for you.

I really look forward to the opportunity & would appreciate to learn more
about how you've instigated the real options thinking in Enron and
especially its integration within the organizational & incentive matters.

Many thanks,

Hi Vince,

Sorry that we couldn't meet in Houston.  Hope your Philadelphia trip was
fruitful and you didn't suffer from weather related flight delays on your
way back to Houston.  Your phone message stated that you may be coming to NY
in Jan. 2001.  That's great & we should definitely plan to see each other in
NY, unless I come to Houston first.  I'd, however, appreciate a brief chat
today and pls call me if you schedule permits.

I'll be heading out to London tomorrow (mainly for the holidays) and won't
be back to the office until Thurs. 1/4, however, I'll be checking my phone-
and e-mail occasionally during the trip.

If today is not convenient, pls call me @ home tomorrow morning until
11:00am (NY time) and otherwise, pls offer another suitable time next week,
your tel. # , and I can call you from London.

Have a great and a very happy holiday season.

Best regards,

Soussan,
914 253 4187 (work)
203 966 7123 (home)

Vince,

Your suggested arrangement is perfect with me and I love both Italian or
Steak... the choice is yours.  I really look forward to our meeting & I
will
be @ the hotel's reception area on time.  It's great that I have your
cell-phone...as a contingency, and just in case you needed to call me, it's
best to leave me a message @ my phone # @ work.

Soussan,

Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the
Galleria.
I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?).

You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.

Look forward to meeting you.

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully
your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are
available either evening for dinner.  Would be great to see you again and
catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your
insights, and the risk book you gave me.

I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits

Hi David,

I am in London and San Francisco next week. Back Mon, Feb 28.
By the way, my wife's name is Ludmila Kaminski, not Kaminsky. All the

Congratulations on your well deserved promotion to Managing Director. I am

The list every year was not complete without your name on it. We shall need

All the best,

Hi Vince:

A few months ago we talked about a letter of recommendation to support my
green card application.  I am applying under the National Interest Waiver
program in order to short cut the labor certification process.  This
requires me to get letters of recommendation demonstrating that my continued
work in the US is in the national interest.  Based on the work that I have
been doing with utilities in risk management this appears to have a
reasonable chance.

Although we have not worked together recently, I was wondering if you would
consider writing a letter on my behalf.  I have worked with my immigration
lawyer to compose a draft letter that would be suitable.  I have attached
this letter as well as the letter from the lawyer explaining where to send
the refernce letter.

I am using a transaction that I worked on with Edison International as an
example of the sort of work that I do, since it was reported in the press.
Edison was unable to hedge its overall short position, so it bought asian
options on gas as a means of approximating the effect of higher energy
prices.  This has turned out to be an effective strategy.

If you have any questions or want to discuss this please contact me by
email, or on my cellphone at 917-446-4781.

Yours sincerely,
Lloyd Spencer.

Hello Vince,
   NIe bardzo wiem czy pisac po polsku czy po angielsku :)
   Co u Ciebie slychac ?
  U mnie troche zmian jak ze juz nie pracuje w SCEM ,  a przenioslem sie do
MIECO  ( a small Marubeni backed energy-america trading company ) . Bardzo
rozne od SCEM. Najbardzij przypomina mi SCEM na poczatku z Joe, jak bylo
20-30 osob. Sa i minusy i plusy. Troche structure i research ale przede
wszystkim weather.   TRrovhe latam miedzy East i West bo sa officy w obydwu
miejscach.  California jest ok w zimie :).
   Na bardziej personalnym froncie;  pamietasz dinner na ktory poszlismy
kiedys na conferencji w NY z Catherine ( she used to work for Williams-
works for Morgan Stanley now ) ,  we are dating  ( for a while) . It is a
good story how we met. So we owe you dinner :)
   Jak bylem w Atlancie to pracowala dla mnie Christa Grey.  Bedzie teraz
konczyla grad school in international relations ( with Eastern European
slant ), i zastanawia sie czy sa jakies mozliwosci polaczenia tego co
robila
ze "Wschodem".  Co robila to bylo przede wszystkim VB implementations
modeli
, ( roznego rodzaju) , Web based data collections, basic research ,  teraz
jest w gas structuring etc.  She speaks russian and was in Ukraine/Poland
few times on Peace Corp assingments. She is very bright and dedicated.
Myslalem zeby ja zwabic do Californii ale ten Eastern European pociag jest
u
niej silniejszy niz u mnie :). I have here resume, wiec jak bys myslal ze
jest jakis fit I will foreward it to you.
  Troche tak mieszanka pisze, przepraszam
  Bede chyba w Houston w pazdzierniku to moze bysmy sie mogli spotkac.
Latwiej pewnie by bylo w NY ( mieszkam po NJ stronie ( rent jest inny niz w
Atlancie :) (201) 222-0435), wiec daj mi znac jakbys mial czas i ochote.
Thanks
Roman

Let's aim for the 5:00 show, if that is ok with you.  I always have so many

Some minor differences between the draft and the final executed version.
I have forgotten to bring the draft today, I shall send  a copy to you

There were some hand-written changes made by Greg ijn the draft that were not

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I would like to apologize for the delay responding, I was on vocation.

Thank you very much for your interest in my work and for your suggestion to 
meet
for lunch/dinner. I will be truly happy to do so. In this regard could you
please let me know what day might be convenient for you. Since I am going to 
fly
from Dallas, I would like, if possible, to plan it in advance.

I look forward to hearing from you and to seeing you soon.

Sincerely,
Valery Kholodnyi

Vince:

I'm looking forward to getting your outline on the economic paradigm. I hope 
that, among all the paper I've bombarded you with over the last few weeks, I 
have included a reprint of a FAll 1998 JACF article entitled "How to use EVA 
in the oil and gas industry." If this is not among the things I have left you 
with, I'd be happy to send you a copy.

The discussion of hydrocarbon reserve values is very much along the lines we 
have been discussing.

Best Regards,

You missed a really fun party last night.  The turnout was even better than
we had hoped--about 250 people.

How about Saturday, April 15 for a 5:00 pm (or so) movie and then dinner?

Have a good weekend,and I hope to see you Tuesday evening at the HEA/NYMEX
Crawfish Boil!

HEA's annual Sporting Clays Tournament is just around the corner, August 15, 
2000 at the American Shooting Centers.  Watch your fax for all the details, 
but prepare for the same format as last year with registration starting at 
1:30 p.m. (late registration after 2:45 earns 2 shot penalty!) and the action 
beginning at 3:30 p.m.  Warm up with the Two-Man Flush at 1:30.  RESERVATION 
AND PRE-PAYMENT REQUIRED BY AUGUST 9TH!  A "private drawing" for a new 
shotgun will be held for reservations/payments received by August 1, 2000 - 
so make your plans now to participate.

 After the competition, dinner will be again in the air conditioned pavilion 
with thousands of dollars in door prizes!  Non Shooters pay $40 per person 
for dinner, drinks and door prizes.  Luck of the Draw (randomly selected 
teams) pay $80 per person - 50 targets, dinner, drinks & door prizes.  Blast 
Masters (make your own 4 shooter team) pay $115 per person - 100 targets, 
dinner, drinks & door prizes.

 Contributions, corporate sponsors and volunteers are needed.  If interested, 
please contact one of our three tournament chairs - Jim Cody (713/230-3550), 
Jeff Eatherton (713/230-7286) or Kemp Jones (713/207-5189). Thanks again to 
our sponsors from last year. Details will be faxed out and available on our 
website Friday (June 16).  Or call Eva Pollard at the HEA office 
(713/651-0551) or Jim Cody for more information.

I may have neglected to send you the attached last week. Enron is one of a 
handful of institutions which could facilitate an entire transaction of the 
kind described here. This is simply your old production payment concept 
applied to corporate finance.

Best,

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much for your prompt response. I look forward to receiving a
copy of your article.

I would also appreciate it if you could let me know whether Enron provides
research grants to individuals who are working in the area of Energy Risk
Management.  Towards my research, I am trying to develop a model to estimate
electricity spot price.

In any case, I will be getting in touch with you again a year or so down the
line when I am nearing completion of my dissertation because Enron is my
dream job.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you,

Yours sincerely,

Vince, 

I thank you again for all your help. ?I will continue to search for job 
opportunities at Enron, and hopefully be able to find a match for me. 
How is your son doing? Is he still interested in computers? There is a

Vince,
I hope you are well. Sorry I have not been in touch but I have been swamped 
trying to build my organization simultaneously as I endeavor to understand 
EBS and navigate its political terrain. Quite interesting. I shall tell you 
more later.
My wife, Elisabeth and I would love to have you for dinner at our house any 
Saturday at you convenience. Would please let me  know which Saturday would 
be suitable? We are both looking forward to it so please let me know.
Thanks,
Tony

Dear Friends and Family,

On April 15 and 16 I will be joining thousands of riders and volunteers on 
the MS 150 which is a two day bike tour from Houston to Austin covering 182 
miles dedicated to end the devastating effects of multiple sclerosis.  
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that is total unpredictable.  Symptoms may be 
mild such as numbness in the limbs, or severe paralysis or loss of vision. 
Most people with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 but the 
unpredictable physical and emotional effects can be lifelong  

My wife, Ilene was diagnosed with MS almost three years ago; at first I was 
at a loss of how I could support her.  That was until I heard of the MS 150, 
which is one of the greatest challenges of my life.  It is my choice to 
participate in the MS 150, Ilene does not have a choice, as she has to live 
with MS every day. 

This will be my third year riding in the MS 150 raising money for the 
National MS Society to fight multiple sclerosis. In 1998 my goal was simple. 
It was to raise money and ride the 182 miles on my own. I succeeded in my 
endeavor by completing the ride on my own steam and raising $6,000.  In 1999 
I raised my goal to $10,000 and finished the tour.  Not only did I meet my 
goal, but surpassed it by raising $15,000 to fight this devastating disease 
with the help of my friends and family.  This year my goal is even greater!  
My wife and I are once again asking for your help.  This year on the 2000 MS 
150 bike tour, my goal is to raise $20,000.

Enron is a big supporter of the MS 150.  For the past two years we were the 
largest bike team and biggest fundraiser of any corporate team nationally.  
Last year we raised $310,000 with 300 riders.  Enron will match dollar for 
dollar on all contributions donated in my name.  Using this secure, fast and

Dear Vince,

Firstly, I really appreciate your time and our meeting last week.  Learning
about Enron's use of leading-edge practices was quite enlightening and I
truly benefited from our visit.

Secondly, I've summarized my key "take-aways" as stated below.  Before
conveying it to my management, however, I really appreciate it if you can
pls review my conclusions and ensure that they are not miss-stated.

Again, thanks so much for your time and wisdom.  I was also honored that
you
gave me a copy of the "Managing Energy Price Risk" book and shall reference
it with interest.  THANK YOU.

I really look forward to seeing you again next time I'm in Houston.

Best regards,
Soussan
(914) 253-4187

PS.  The latest Fortune article on ENE is a great read and substantiates
the
company's innovative and creative approach to business.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

------
As you may know, I was invited to visit with Enron (ENE) last week.  I met
with Vince Kaminski, the VP and head of research in the risk management
group of ENE.  Vince who used to be with Salomon Brothers and AT&T is the
"brain" of ENE w.r.t. their analytical tools for pricing of commodities,
hedging, optimization of financial and physical transactions, as well as
the
value-at-risk systems.  In addition, Vince has received the 1999 James H.
McGraw Award for Energy Risk Management (Energy Risk Manager of the Year)
and is well published.  He is the key contributor to a best-selling
publication by Risk Books entitled: Managing Energy Price Risk.

Our meeting was mainly focused on gaining additional insights re
leading-edge practices within ENE.  My key findings are summarized below:

1. ENE does not use corporate price premises.  They use market price info
only and adhere to mark-to-market accounting.
2. ENE uses the "Heath, Jarrow, and Morton" methods for modeling price
dynamics (I've asked BIC for a copy of the associated paper).  They have
their own "home-grown" software, however, they periodically review selected
external developments for internal inclusion and advancement.
3. Vince's group comprises of Mathematicians, Physicists, and Operations
Researchers who are responsible for the development and advancement of
ENE's
risk management tools.  These models are religiously used by the traders,
risk managers, and BUs across ENE.
4. Investment proposals are screened, risked, and "ROVed" by a separate
corporate group (similar to our Special Studies and with business and real
options skills) who work in conjunction with the BUs.  All evaluations and
transactions are marked-to-market.
5. ENE does not use efficient-frontier portfolio concepts.  They "VC fund"
any opportunity that has a credible value proposition and can stand on its
own.  They believe that with the current plentiful liquidity in the market,
project-financing in not an issue for a "good" opportunity.  However, they
closely monitor the development of each opportunity, within their deep
portfolio, at the corporate level and know how to "fail fast".
6. The employee reward system is based on P&Ls as well as the creation of
new business.
7. Most employees have stock options.

I really enjoyed my visit and hope to meet with Vince again the next time
I'm in Houston.

Hi Vince,

Sorry that we couldn't meet in Houston.  Hope your Philadelphia trip was
fruitful and you didn't suffer from weather related flight delays on your
way back to Houston.  Your phone message stated that you may be coming to NY
in Jan. 2001.  That's great & we should definitely plan to see each other in
NY, unless I come to Houston first.  I'd, however, appreciate a brief chat
today and pls call me if you schedule permits.

I'll be heading out to London tomorrow (mainly for the holidays) and won't
be back to the office until Thurs. 1/4, however, I'll be checking my phone-
and e-mail occasionally during the trip.

If today is not convenient, pls call me @ home tomorrow morning until
11:00am (NY time) and otherwise, pls offer another suitable time next week,
your tel. # , and I can call you from London.

Have a great and a very happy holiday season.

Best regards,

Soussan,

Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the
Galleria.
I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?).

You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.

Look forward to meeting you.

Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully
your
flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"
doesn't get in the way.  It's best to leave me a message @ my usual work #
on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.

I'll be staying @ the Westin Oaks in The Galleria... any preferred place
that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
problem for me either.

Will be great to see you again.

Mark Lay:  I shared confidentially with Vince Kaminski my developing
concept of a highly inefficient not-for-profit enterprise with
dramatically increasing costs.  I believe that a for-profit economic
model is possible that should reverse these skyrocketing costs and
ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national, if not, global
impact of health care costs.   Vince seems to also believe in the
concepts potential.  The CEO of one of the biggest U.S. blood banks has
already asked to become involved.   I would like involve more people
with vision, means and desire to help make this a reality.  I would look
forward to meeting with you to talk further.  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

Dear Vince-

I am soooo gland to see you get the promotion you so deserve.  I have always 
thought you should have received such honors many years ago.  I'm glad to see 
Enron finally did you right.

Good luck and congratulations,

I called out muni desk to have them take a look at the current munis avaiable 
that looked best at this time to invest $50,000 going out to 30 years for 
you.  The following is what they came up with....

Pecos Co TX Cert of Obl w/a Coupon 5.5% Matures in 02/01/11 callable at par 
on 02/01/07 offered at $101.964 - AAA rated

Brownsville Util Rev w/a coupon of 5.25% maturing in 09/01/15 callable at par 
on 09/01/05 offered at $97.425 - AAA rated

Alvin TX ISD PSF w/a coupon of 5.75% maturing in 08/15/22 callable at par on 
08/15/10 offered at par - AAA rated

Houston TX Air Revs w/a coupon of 5.00% maturing in 07/01/28 callable at par 
on 07/01/08 offered at 86.479 - AAA rated

Remember, these are subject to change, but if these interest you and they are 
not still available, I will see if there is something comparable.

Talk to you soon.  Please call me with any questions.  Thanks, Julie

George-

Here is one statistical method (linear regression), applied to Hosanna's fund 
giving. The method is deterministic, where contributions each Sunday are 
attempted to be explained by significant events on the church's and members' 
calendars, and the method shoudl be considered in contrast to an anecdotal 
one, where each Sunday's giving might be estimated to be the average giving 
of the same Sunday (e.g., each 2nd Sunday in January) in the past.

The following effects are estimated independently by the computer (they add 
and subtract with each other accordingly; some Sundays can have more than one 
effect "in play"):

1) most positive for giving: an additional +$8,802 for special pastoral 
appeals (3 of them in the past 3 years)

2) positive for giving: an additional +$2,551 Easter and nearest- Christmas 
"Sunday," an additional +$59 Thanksgiving Sunday, and a tiny additional +$1 
each week pure time trend.

3) negative for giving: -$304 for Sundays of Monday Federal Holiday weekends, 
and -$9 during the Summer (June 1-Aug 31)

4) "wave": there  is an $80 per week "wave"- giving $80 higher one week, $80 
lower the next, etc ...

The computer can explain roughly 60% of the absolute variation in giving the 
past 3 years using this approach. Keep in mind, much of the information, 
statistically, is captured in the pastoral appeals, Easter and Christmas 
Sundays, and Holiday weekends. The rest of the variation cannot be explained 
by this simple model (i.e., it looks like "noise").

Here are the predictions for fund giving for the upcoming year. You can 
cut-and-paste these numbers to any file or spreadsheet  you like. They may 
seem "boring" to you; please remember they are the deterministic components 
of a process that involves a lot of volatility, and your church's actual 
experience will predictably be volatile. These numbers are as-if the "means" 
of  experiences dependent on the "standard deviations."

Van,

It's nice to hear from you. I am sure that you can always come back 
to Enron if you don't like living in New York.

I used to work for Salomon and chances are you will be working in the same 
building in lower Manhattan where I spent 7  years of my life.

I hope you have a great Holiday  Season.


Vicne

Subject: Greetings


Dear Vince:

I just wanted to get in touch with you, as my last fall semester here
draws to a close and this is something of a transition point for me.  To
update you on my job search, I have been extended an offer for a position
within Enron's Analyst Program.  The offer was very attractive and I had
numerous things to consider in reaching my decision.  Unfortunately, I
will be declining Enron's offer of employment to take a position in the
Investment Banking Division of Salomon Smith Barney in New York.  My
preference at this point is to live outside of Houston, and although my
hope is also to return to Houston in future, New York offers some
exciting options for me now.  I will be starting there in July of this
summer.  I hope that I will have future opportunities to be an advocate
of Enron and look forward to keeping in touch with you and the Research
Group.

Please give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very
happy holiday season!  Also please feel free to contact me at any time.
I can give you my future contact information when I have it.

Thank you and I hope I'll see you again.

Sincerely,
Van

P.S.  Feel free to forward my news onto Mike Roberts if that would
appropriate.  I didn't have his email with me.

Subject: Simulated Trading


Dear Friends and Colleagues:

NYMEX    is hosting a cocktail reception and a simulated open outcry trading
"class":

Thursday, Sept. 28, 2000
5:00 - 7:00 pm
Houston Center Club
(downtown-across from the 4 Seasons)

This is being held in conjuction with the Crude Oil Association.  They charge
$25 at the door.

However, as a host I can have as many of my colleagues there for FREE!

But,  I must know if you are coming by September 24, 2000 c.o.b., to give a
count to the Houston Center Club.

I hope you can all attend.  Please feel free to invite someone to come with
you. The simulated trading will be held three times during the evening, and
is very interesting.

I look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you on 9/28!

Jana

ps-call me if you have any questions

Hello Vince, 

I stopped by to see you today 03/28/01. However, Mrs. Shirley notified me 
that you were out of the country.  Look, I need another favor.  My wife, whom 
you met last summer, and I  have been living in The Woodlands about a month 
now.  We have tried, to no avail, to get her in the local school district as 
a speech pathologist or a K-6 grade school teacher. She could easily find a 
teaching job in the Houston Independent School District. However, I would 
prefer that she taught locally, in The Woodlands.  I need to know if you know 
of anyone we can contact to get her in The Woodlands School System.  I would 
greatly appreciate if you could help us out once again.  I am attaching her 
resume' for your perusal. Thanks A Million Vince!!!

Sincerely,

Datren Williams

Hello Vince,

How are you this week?

My week is pretty relaxing - I am taking the training for the very last
product of my company, called Voicenet, and I will achieve the highest state
of initiation with Destia (Viatel) products, ha...

Unfortunatelly I have not been promoted for Business VIP Representative (the
position associated with T-1) as I do not have any experience with it.

I am blaming myself because I cannot discipline myself to study consequently
every day for GMAT.

All the best to you and see you on Saturday.

Patrycja

Just like to say that it has been great meeting and working with you all.  I 
will be leaving Enron effective July 5th  to do investment banking in Hong 
Kong.   I will initially be based in New York and will be moving to Hong Kong 
after a few months.  Do contact me when you are in the vicinity.  I don't 
know my contact details yet and would let you know once I get it.   In the 
meantime, I will always be checking my e-mail at royibasco@yahoo.com.  Please

fits well in the area of his? expertise. I am wondering if you know of some

Since? I spoke to you last, a number of things have changed. Recently, my

GMAC. Needless to say,? this is exciting albeit making the life a little 
more hectic than? usual.

business plan and he would help if he could.  I explained that I was at
the "pre" business plan stage.   Further, that I had hoped to discuss my
search for collaborators to become co-founders.  People with vision that
might help develop and refine the concept, identify model components,
isolate modules for the initial effort and build a business plan
suitable for angel investors not VCs.   I might need your help in
conveying this to him.  I have struggled to put on paper a very rough
draft of how it might be best describe as to the direction it might go
and what might conceptually be possible.  Please look at this and tell
me if I am going too far at this point.  I do not want to implant
insurmountable obstacle in anyone's mind.  I hope to hear from you.  Al

Vince, 

I hope you are well. Until today, I did not know there was another Kaminski 
at Enron. Perhaps you know him already but I found him in the Enron address 
book his first name is Jim.

I am enrolled in the above mandatory program and I have nominated you in the 
peer/colleague category,  to provide feedback on me. I do not know the nature 
of the questions you would be required to respond to but sometime soon you 
would receive an e-mail asking you for your input. 

I know your plate is full and life is already hectic but I thought I could 
nominate you for your input.  I should be grateful if you would take some 
time off your very hectic schedule and provide the feedback on me.

Very many thanks,

Tony

Mark:

I enjoyed our meeting last Tuseday very much and I look forward to calling 
you again in a week or so. I think your idea of having me present to several 
senior Enron executives including Koenig and, perhaps, Jeff Skilling is very 
good.

I discussed this a bit with Vince Kaminski on Thursday as well and he 
expressed a strong interest in attending the meeting as well.

Regards,

Vince,

Thanks for your quick action on this.  I try to be selective about sending
out recommendations proactively, but in John's case I am very confident that
he will add a lot of value to whoever hires him.  On a different topic I was
pleased to see that you will also be on the EPRM program again in the fall.

Duane

Vince,
It was a pleasure to meet you last week at our Rodeo night.  I am glad you
could join us.

I am going to fax you the invitation to the Houston Symphony Partners party
that we discussed.  I hope you can attend.

Keep in touch and let's get together for lunch and/or seeing "American
Beauty."

Vince, I want to congratulate you on your promotion to Managing Director!  As 
I scanned the list of people who were promoted, I was so pleased to see your 
name on the list.  As large as Enron is, it is refreshing to see people like 
you with incredible skill and talent  receive deserving promotions.  I have 
certainly enjoyed working with you and the R&D team over the past year and 
look forward to a successful 2000 as we break new ground for ET&S.  Kim.

Vince-

I got your message (I was up on the roof of the building helping to fix the 
weather satellite dish- what a gorgeous view of Houston!).

I appreciate your words. Everything remains fine, Vince. You are my "father" 
here at Enron, and I admire and respect you greatly. I think I know the kind 
of person you are, in terms of your integrity, and I admire the high 
standards you set for all of us in your extended "Group."

I want to let you know I am not the only one in the group who doesn't 
appreciate the way Maureen disrespects you. You remain the key external 
factor in their success- it is not simply their own abilities that matter to 
their futures but your own- Vince's- success with upper management that 
matters.

We respect you, and we don't like it when you are disrespected. Maureen 
didn't disrespect me today, Vince, she disrespected you.

It's time I told you something. Last April, Maureen, highly intoxicated 
following a work-related function at Ninfa's, made an unsolicited predatory 
sexual advance on me at my desk on the 19th floor. I was shocked and 
disgusted, but I didn't say one word about this, Vince, because I played it 
out and didn't want to put you into the position of having a raving Maureen 
in your midst as you perhaps had to fire her and then endure a litany of 
gender-bias crap lawsuits.

I "took one for the team," Vince. I can'rt say I would do it again- Maureen 
is brazen to berate me after what she did, in public no less.

I appreciate your bringing me into Enron. I've found a respectful and, 
indeed, a loving work environment. I remain willing to do whatever I can to 
help the Group.

Clayton

Czesc Ludmilo,Wicku i Wicusiu

Co slychac. W Polsce zimno, ponuro, w Gdansku aktualnie odwilz, co  sprzyja
grypie. Uciekamy przed grypa na tydzien do Bialki Tatrzanskiej pod
Zakopanem. Bylismy tam w zeszlym roku przez 4 dni w zimie i bardzo nam sie
podobalo. Gory w zimie sa naprawde piekne. Bylismy pierwszy raz w zimie w
gorach od 25 lat.
Bardzo bedziemy chcieli wpasc jutro do Pabianic (albo  w drodze powrotnej do
Gdanska). Nie wiem, czy to sie uda, bo wieczor zapada bardzo wczesnie, a ja
nie moge jezdzic w nocy. Latwo sie mecze i szybki zasypiam .Bylem u Twoich
dziewczyn we wrzesniu, przypominalem sobie stare czasy jak nocowalismy u Was
z rodzicami, ojciec siedzial na lezaku pod jablonia. Ech.
Bylo, minelo.Slyszalem, ze Wicusiowi idzie nadzwyczajnie. Pamietam, jakim Ty
byles ulubienicem taty (Peptydy w Juracie, pamietasz).
Michal ze swoja narzeczona wybiera sie w lecie do Ameryki. Chcialby
podszkolic sie w angielskim i przy okazji troche popracowac. Oboje studiuja
medycyne na trzecim roku. Jak myslisz, mogliby znalezc prace w Houston ? Czy
moglbys im w tym pomoc ? Oni chcieliby tylko znalezc prace, nie chca Was w
niczym absorbowac.
Co o tym myslisz ?
Jak bedziesz znowu w Polsce, daj znac. Musze z przyjemnoscia powiedziec, ze
poglady polityczne Eli, Jadzi i nasze sa identyczne. Nawet nie mamy sie o co
poklocic. Generalnie sie zgadzam  z Balcerowiczem, ale uwazam, ze
reforma zdrowia jest do d.  Doznajemy tego na wlasnej skorze.
Trzymajcie sie cieplo i do uslyszenia.
Pa,pa Adam T. chemat@softel.gda.pl

I keep receiving such unsolicited messages

Is there any way to block out the messages from this source?

ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO

REQUEST FOR AN ASSISTANCE

Dear Sir,

With due respect and knowledge of your good reputation, I decided to contact
you for this matter that need urgent attention.  I am COL. DAGOGO KALU.  I
was the commandant of the West African Peace keeping Force & Monitoring
Group (ECOMOG) until I sustained a very serious injury that put me off the
military camp for about 3 months now.  Honestly, I have full trust for your
honesty hence I write this letter to you.

During our recent mission to Sierra Leone, a diamond rich West African
country to cushion the war between the rebels and the ruling Government, we
ran into 2 boxes (consignment) right inside a thick jungle where we believed
was a hide out of the rebels.  As we opened the boxes, one that is smaller
contains numerous sizes of raw diamond.  The Bigger box contains about US
$15.2 Million, which we believed to be the total amount of diamond sold at
that period of time by the rebels before we invaded the place.

Myself and my two other colleagues took the boxes away.  I took the bigger
box containing the US $15.2 million to Cotonou Benin Republic which is the
nearby country and deposited it with one Security Company for safe keeping
to enable me think wisely on what to do with the money.  The smaller box
containing the raw diamond I gave it to my other 2 colleagues, which they
accepted in good faith.

A month after this, the rebels lunched a counter-attack on us where I
sustained a very serious gun shut wound on my right leg.  A lot of our boys
died but few survived.  At this moment, I am receiving medical treatment
here in London.  This is why I need your help urgently.

I need a Foreign Company I will present as the Beneficiary of the huge
amount and also pay in the money into their account.  Your Bank account must
be a good one where we shall not pay much as tax.  You shall also serve as
the general overseer and guardian of this fund and all the investment of
this money will be under your care until I recover fully.

I will give you all the details of the transaction immediately I get your
response.  You will also get a suitable percentage (%) as your share.  All
the documents of the DEPOSIT OF THE MONEY are intact with my wife.  I have
already finalized this arrangement with the Security Company so there is no
problem at all.

Please you can reach me through my Direct Tel/Fax No: 448453342783 where I
am receiving treatment.  In your reply, state clearly your direct telephone
and fax numbers for easy communication and more confidentiality.

Further details will be given to you once I hear from you.
I await your urgent response soonest.
Best regards,
COL. DAGOGO KALU

   Mark:  Per our brief conversation this morning, the attached email was
   sent to you yesterday.  I hope that you might understand that I am
   conceptually looking for "founders" and at the "pre" business plan
   stage.  There is an enormous problem existing with a very attractive
   economic reward and willing participants needing this solution.  I need
   help.  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

   Mark Lay:  I shared confidentially with Vince Kaminski my developing
   concept of a highly inefficient not-for-profit enterprise with
   dramatically increasing costs.  I believe that a for-profit economic
   model is possible that should reverse these skyrocketing costs and
   ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national, if not, global
   impact of health care costs.   Vince seems to also believe in the
   concepts potential.  The CEO of one of the biggest U.S. blood banks has
   already asked to become involved.   I would like involve more people
   with vision, means and desire to help make this a reality.  I would look
   forward to meeting with you to talk further.  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158

Wicku,
I hoped to hear from you. Please, let me know whether your plans have
changed, and if so, when you are coming to Palo Alto.

I spent theer weeks in Europe in September (had dinner with Leszek and
Ewa),
and went to Sydney as a guest of NBC. Upon return I caught a flu, and
travelled heavily congested to New York, which led to some ear
problems.Consequently I intend to stay put for several weeks, and will have
to reschedule my trip to Houston for Dec. or January. Hope to see you here
before then.
Best to all three of you.
Andrzej

I shall be in the Bay Area  between the 10th and the 20th of October.

Hope to see your then.

Hello Vince,
   NIe bardzo wiem czy pisac po polsku czy po angielsku :)
   Co u Ciebie slychac ?
  U mnie troche zmian jak ze juz nie pracuje w SCEM ,  a przenioslem sie do
MIECO  ( a small Marubeni backed energy-america trading company ) . Bardzo
rozne od SCEM. Najbardzij przypomina mi SCEM na poczatku z Joe, jak bylo
20-30 osob. Sa i minusy i plusy. Troche structure i research ale przede
wszystkim weather.   TRrovhe latam miedzy East i West bo sa officy w obydwu
miejscach.  California jest ok w zimie :).
   Na bardziej personalnym froncie;  pamietasz dinner na ktory poszlismy
kiedys na conferencji w NY z Catherine ( she used to work for Williams-
works for Morgan Stanley now ) ,  we are dating  ( for a while) . It is a
good story how we met. So we owe you dinner :)
   Jak bylem w Atlancie to pracowala dla mnie Christa Grey.  Bedzie teraz
konczyla grad school in international relations ( with Eastern European
slant ), i zastanawia sie czy sa jakies mozliwosci polaczenia tego co robila
ze "Wschodem".  Co robila to bylo przede wszystkim VB implementations modeli
, ( roznego rodzaju) , Web based data collections, basic research ,  teraz
jest w gas structuring etc.  She speaks russian and was in Ukraine/Poland
few times on Peace Corp assingments. She is very bright and dedicated.
Myslalem zeby ja zwabic do Californii ale ten Eastern European pociag jest u
niej silniejszy niz u mnie :). I have here resume, wiec jak bys myslal ze
jest jakis fit I will foreward it to you.
  Troche tak mieszanka pisze, przepraszam
  Bede chyba w Houston w pazdzierniku to moze bysmy sie mogli spotkac.
Latwiej pewnie by bylo w NY ( mieszkam po NJ stronie ( rent jest inny niz w
Atlancie :) (201) 222-0435), wiec daj mi znac jakbys mial czas i ochote.
Thanks
Roman

Dear Vince,

bardzo dziekuje za podeslana literature, szczegolnie drugie wydanie
ksiazki. Bylismy w Londynie w czerwcu zeszlego roku, ale w ksiegarni
znalezlismy tylko piersze wydanie. Obaj z Alkiem (ojcem) wspolpracujemy z
energetyka (glownie Polska) od kilku lat. W zeszlym roku wydalismy ksiazke
"Gielda Energii: Strategie zarzadzania ryzykiem", a obecnie pracujemy nad
jej angielskim wydaniem. Na jaki adres Ci ja przyslac?

Serdeczne pozdrowienia,

Rafal

Dr. Kaminski,

On Wednesday, June 14th I attended your presentation entitled "THE CHALLENGE
OF VALUATION OF ENERGY RELATED DERIVATIVES" at the Risk 2000 conference in
Boston.  Can you please e-mail me the slides you presented.

Also, you mentioned that the method you used to calculate volatility for
energy prices was not the "normal" method.  Can you please tell me, or give
me a reference to the method that you did use.

Thank you,

Hello Patrycja,

Greetings from the Big Apple.

Saturday works for me. Let's meet at 4:00 p.m. at Carrabba's. It's an
Italian
restaurant on I-45 in the Woodlands. After you pass Conroe, take the
Research
Forest exit  (5-10 miles past Conroe) and stay on the feeder road. Go
through
the lights (Research Forest intersection with I-45). As you continue along
the feeder road you will pass on your right the Woodlands Mall and the
ExxonMobil building,. The restaurant will be on your right, about 200-300
yards before the next lights (I-45 and Sawdust).

I shall have my cell phone with me (713 898 9960). In case you arrive early
you can stop at my home: 10 Snowbird Place, (281) 367 5377. I shall send you
later the instructions how to get there. I shall leave home around 3:45.

Look forward to meeting you.


Vince

Wicke,
Thanks for a prompt reply. I am not planning any particular trip to Houston
yet. For the time being, I am about to leave for London, and then Poland. I
will most likely be at the Olympics in Sydney in late September, and in NY
in early October. Mid-October could be the first realistic opportunity to
visit with Enron, although I am looking forward to seeing you sooner in Palo
Alto. I am simply curious whether and how we could leverage together core
competencies and connectivity that both our companies seem to have or are
developing.

I am Senior Vice President for Visa USA, responsible for strategy and
planning. I would probably bring with me (though I haven't discuss it yet)
people in charge of our network or/and our COO.
Best,
Andrzej

Thanks. Please, send me the information about the dates
when you plan to visit Houston. Also, the information about
your position/title/responsibilities (as well as the info
about the other members of your team) would be useful.

I shall be in the Bay Area  between the 10th and the 20th of October.

Hope to see your then.

Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

Hi everyone,

 before Grant leaves Houston, I wanted to have a small get-together at my 
house for dinner.  Since everybody is very busy, I want to schedule a date 
well in advance, so I am suggesting Saturday, Dec 2.  This will be dinner 
with family.  Please let me know if this works for you.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY & hope all is well.  As you may recall from the ROG real
options conference in NY, I'd indicated the opportunity to visit with you
next time I'm in Houston.  I'll be there during 4/18-4/21 & wonder if we can
pls meet on Wed. 4/19 in your offices.  Would appreciate it if you can pls
let me know whether you're available then (I'm flexible on the schedule
particulars).  If not, pls let me know whether 4/18 (afternoon), 4/20
(afternoon), or 4/21 (morning) will work for you.

I really look forward to the opportunity & would appreciate to learn more
about how you've instigated the real options thinking in Enron and
especially its integration within the organizational & incentive matters.

Many thanks,

Hi Vince,

Can you e-mail me your mailing address in Houston and I will send you a hard
copy of the above today.  Apologies for delay, but I wanted to ensure that
Les Clewlow had received his copy in Sydney before distributing any other
copies.

Incidentally, today (March 27th) is a red letter day in the UK as the NETA /
new electricity trading arrangements have gone 'live'.  Should be
interesting to observe the development of the paper market in the coming
months - you're no doubt aware that IPE have just launched an electricity
futures contract.

Regards

Bernard

Subject:  RE: 1997 Risk paper on Pricing of Electricity Derivatives


Vince,

I can send you a Scientific Word DVI file (at the weekend) if you can read
SCientific Word files ?  The dissertation hasn't been reviewed by Les or
the
External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the
Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to
both our company's businesses - although I ultimately didn't have the time
to 'explicitly' price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly
implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options -
rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a
rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be
made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.

In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and
essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :

1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is "incomplete"
(synthesising
the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) -
note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with
'term structure' securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and
Das and;

2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for 'implementing' the
price
of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth
process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of
CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).


Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done
much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation
framework ?  I'm about to start a project evaluation of embedded
optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward
gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion
and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of
out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a
pure-diffusion
framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available
market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve
for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition
means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility

Bernard,

I am forwarding your message to my assistant and she will mail you a
reprint.
I would be glad to take a look at your dissertation. Is it available as a
publication, working paper?

Vince

Subject:  1997 Risk paper on Pricing of Electricity Derivatives


Hello Vince,

My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les
Clewlow,
who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at
Warwick
Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump
Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
come to my attention :

"The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US
POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.

and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present
and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.

Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at
University
of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK,
where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach
(spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.

Thanks in advancve

Bernard Murphy

Vince,

You beat me to the congrats.  The surprise was that I already believed you 
were a Managing Director, so a long overdue congratulations to you.

Vicky,

Please, send me your resume.

I shall forward it to a number of employees of  Enron in London
with my strongest recommendation. I shall send you  the list
of names. The resume will make it easier for me to=20
identify good targets.

Please, make sure you will contact me if there is no reaction.
People here are very busy and, as you know, things fall through the cracks.

Vince

Dear Vince,

How are you? Well I hope.

I hope you don=01,t mind me writing to you. You may remember that 5 months =
ago
I left Risk Publications and moved to a charity. Having been here for only =
a
few months, I have decided that this job is not for me (I miss the buzz of =
a
corporate office) and I have decided to move back into the corporate sector=
.

Because of my previous experience and knowledge of the energy sector, I am
very interested in moving into this area. I have always thought that it
would be great to work for Enron because it is such a dynamic company and I
am planning to approach the London office to discuss any opportunities,
which might be available. I am particularly interested in product marketing
and research, although I am very open-minded at the moment. I wondered
whether you could recommend the right person to speak to in London.

I know that you are incredibly busy, but any help you can give me would be
fantastic Vince.

Thanks and best regards,


Vicky Windsor
